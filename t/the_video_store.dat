25|$|The final {{confirmed}} murder {{occurred on}} May 7 in Raytown, Missouri. The victim was 37-year-old Sarah Blessing {{who was working}} in her gift shop, Store of Many Colors.

He discovered Blessing's body after checking to see what had occurred in the store. A clerk at a nearby grocery store also saw the suspect. He was climbing a hill towards I-70.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, Troma Pictures, founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986), Redneck Zombies (1986), and Surf Nazis Must Die (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma's best-known production is The Toxic Avenger (1985); its hideous hero, affectionately known as Toxie, was featured in several sequels and a TV cartoon series. One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome-based Empire Pictures, whose first production, Ghoulies, reached theaters in 1985. The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics: Empire's financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, at <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>store.</b> A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases went this route as well, appearing only briefly in theaters, if at all. The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low-budget film industry, as many B movies quickly wound up as [...] "filler" [...] material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose.|$|E

500|$|... "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] {{features}} {{a number of}} references to popular culture. The title of the episode is itself a play on the film Days of Thunder, starring American actor Tom Cruise. The song used {{at the end of}} the episode is [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", a song by Bette Midler. While Homer is watching television at the beginning of the episode, Marge and her sisters, Patty and Selma, go through a catalog of different hairstyles; Patty tells her sisters that she wants Mary Tyler Moore's hairstyle, referencing the American actress known for her roles in television sitcoms. When Marge and her sisters head to the beauty parlor, Homer promises Marge that he will take Lisa to <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>store.</b> When they arrive at the store, Homer watches a clip from the latest McBain film that sees McBain's partner being brutally shot in the chest, a reference to a similar scene in the film Lethal Weapon. McBain's partner is black, a reference to the fact that Dirty Harry's partner is black in the film Sudden Impact.|$|E
500|$|From the day Jason was cast, rumours {{began to}} fly {{that a major}} American actor would be cast {{alongside}} him to bolster the film's international appeal. On 31 July 2007 {{it was revealed that}} Sean Astin, world-famous for his part in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, had been signed for the role. - before filming started, Sean had to ask his agent just who [...] "Dave Jason" [...] was and left <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>store</b> with two large bags of David Jason's back catalogue to watch. The casting of Tim Curry as Trymon and Christopher Lee as the voice of Death was revealed at the same time. The choice of Astin as Twoflower was criticised by some fans, who had anticipated that the tourist would be Oriental. [...] Pratchett responded to this criticism in an open letter, where he noted that he had only described Twoflower as [...] "exotically foreign" [...] until Interesting Times. The choice of Lee to replace Ian Richardson, who had voiced Death in Hogfather, was more widely accepted; Lee had previously voiced the part in the animated adaptations of Soul Music and Wyrd Sisters.|$|E
500|$|Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed {{was more}} {{positive}} about the episode, commenting that the episode's emphasis is on Homer's parenting, like many other season three episodes, and [...] "contrary to popular opinion, Homer is actually a good father who tries to do good by his children." [...] He thought the racing sequences featured [...] "good animation and direction", but considered {{the highlight of the}} episode to be the clip from the film McBain that Homer watches in <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>store.</b> Meyers gave the episode a 4/5 rating. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, who listed the episode as one of his favorites from season three, said that [...] "on the surface, 'Saturdays of Thunder' essentially just rehashes" [...] the theme of the previous episode, [...] "Lisa's Pony", in which Homer tries to be a better father for Lisa. Jacobson commented that [...] "Saturdays of Thunder", however, [...] "simply seems funnier than 'Lisa's Pony'. The soapbox derby elements provide lots of great gags. [...] offers a great episode." [...] Like Meyers, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide thought the highlight of the episode was the McBain video.|$|E

On the way, however, Archer reveals he is aware of Malory's plan and has been attempting to discourage Cyril from becoming a field agent, presumably due to his own feelings for Lana, and had orchestrated the whole fiasco to this end (revealing the prostitute was merely tranquilized). At this point, the car is rammed by a pursuing vehicle. [...] Cyril believes this is part of Archer's hoax, until their pursuer opens fire on them. In a true show of his character, Archer threatens to eject from the car and leave the hysterical Cyril behind. Their mystery attacker then ceases fire and reveals herself to be Lana, who has discovered Archer's assignment and decided {{to put a stop to}} it. Despite Cyril's concern about being caught with a dead hooker, Lana reveals she is only upset he felt the need to keep secrets from her, so she punishes Cyril by forcing him to buy interracial pornography from [...] "the sweet old Korean lady" [...] at <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>store.</b> Archer releases the prostitute in the trunk after Cyril and Lana depart, who reveals she was not in on the plan. Archer is forced to not only pay her obscene amounts of money as collateral, but also give her his car, leaving him stranded.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Brunner also {{represented}} neighbors {{of an adult}} video store that was being razed {{to make way for}} a McDonald's store in an affluent neighborhood. [...] She obtained a 14-day restraining order to halt issuance of a zoning certificate and demolition and building permits. [...] The Bexley, OH neighborhood hosts the Ohio Governor's Mansion and mansions once owned by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and The Limited chairman Les Wexner. [...] She got citizens to appear before the zoning appeals board to attempt to stop the construction. The Citizens were unsuccessful in convincing the Board of Zoning Appeals to change their earlier decisions. [...] After the citizens were unsuccessful with the zoning board, they pursued remedy in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. [...] In addition to the court proceedings, the citizens sought the attention of the City Council in attempt to preserve the neighborhood by keeping <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>store</b> from being converted into a McDonald's. [...] On April 7, 1995, Brunner gained a verdict for her clients that in the interest of avoiding traffic congestion and pedestrian dangers, the McDonald's would not be allowed to build. [...] The developer attempted to appeal the decision by obtaining friend-of-the-court briefs from surrounding municipalities. The Franklin County Appeals Court overturned the lower court ruling making way for the construction of the McDonald's. [...] Brunner's clients appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. [...] A few other cases against the developers remained in some lower courts. [...] However, these were unsuccessful. [...] After the lower court zoning victory, in May 1995, she was hired to oppose a [...] project.|$|E
2500|$|The {{growth of}} the cable {{television}} industry in the 1980s helped support the low-budget film market, as many B movies quickly wound up as [...] "filler" [...] material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose. The broadcast version of the midnight movie remained popular: the nationally syndicated Movie Macabre package starring Cassandra Peterson—aka Elvira, Mistress of the Dark—was essentially a brassier copy of The Vampira Show, presenting mostly low-budget horror films interspersed with Elvira's satiric commentary and abundant display of cleavage. The video rental market was also becoming central to B-film economics: Empire's financial model, for instance, relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, at <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>store.</b> A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases appeared only briefly in theaters, or not at all.|$|E
