50|$|In industry, <b>toggle</b> <b>action</b> presses {{are still}} popular. The usual {{arrangement}} involves {{a very strong}} crankshaft and a heavy duty connecting rod which drives the press. Large and heavy flywheels are driven by electric motors but the flywheels only turn the crankshaft when clutches are activated.|$|E
50|$|In {{a classic}} lever-action firearm of the Henry-Winchester type, rounds are {{individually}} loaded into a tubular magazine parallel to {{and below the}} barrel. A short bolt is held in place with an over center <b>toggle</b> <b>action.</b> Once closed, the over center action prevents opening solely by the force on the bolt when the weapon is fired. This <b>toggle</b> <b>action</b> is operated by a hand grip that forms part of the trigger guard. When operated, a spring in the tubular magazine pushes a fresh round into position. Returning the operating lever to the home position chambers the round and closes the breach. An interlock prevents firing unless the toggle is fully closed. The famous Model 1873 Winchester is exemplary of this type. Later lever-action designs, such as Marlin leverguns and those designed for Winchester by John Browning, use one or two vertical locking blocks instead of a toggle-link. There also exist lever-action rifles that feed from a box magazine, which allows them to use pointed bullets.|$|E
5000|$|The Albion {{press is}} a model of early iron hand {{printing}} press, originally designed and manufactured in London by Richard Whittaker Cope (d. 1828?) around 1820. It worked by a simple <b>toggle</b> <b>action,</b> unlike the complex lever-mechanism of the Columbian press and the Stanhope press. Albions continued to be manufactured, in a range of sizes, until the 1930s. They were used for commercial book-printing until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, and thereafter chiefly for proofing, jobbing work and by private presses. Francis Meynell often used an Albion to take proof impressions of his designs for Nonesuch Press books, and printed some small books and ephemera using the press.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the stiffness and damping of computer keyboard keys, a computer-controlled test rig that can measure computer key displacement, velocity, and contact force has been designed. The test rig, {{consisting of a}} single-axis stage carrying a probe for contacting keys, {{has been used to}} collect contact force and motion data as computer keys are depressed and released at constant velocities up to 80 mm∕s. Keys that employ a rubber-dome under their caps to achieve the necessary compliance and <b>toggling</b> <b>action</b> were tested. The results demonstrate a nonlinear stiffness force versus displacement characteristic at a given speed and the presence of damping-type forces that increase with key depression speed at a given displacement. In particular, the results indicate that the peak force at the 80 mm∕s rate of depression increases relative to the quasistatic (0. 5 mm∕s) force level by over 12 % for the “Enter,” “K,” and “Spacebar” keys. This paper describes the hardware and software configuration, and presents sample results of the stiffness and damping characteristics of keys during depression-return stroke tests...|$|R
5000|$|After the war, Oliver Winchester renamed New Haven Arms the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The company {{modified}} {{and improved}} the basic {{design of the}} Henry rifle, creating the first Winchester rifle: the Model 1866. It retained the [...]44 Henry cartridge, was likewise built on a bronze-alloy frame, and had an improved magazine and a wooden forearm. In 1873 Winchester introduced the steel-framed Model 1873 chambering the more potent [...]44-40 centerfire cartridge. In 1876, {{in a bid to}} compete with the powerful single-shot rifles of the time, Winchester brought out the Model 1876 (Centennial Model). While it chambered more powerful cartridges than the 1866 and 1873 models, the <b>toggle</b> link <b>action</b> was not strong enough for the popular high-powered rounds used in Sharps or Remington single-shot rifles.|$|R
5000|$|The Orvill Robinson Model 2 rifle: Orvill Robinson, a New York-based {{firearms}} designer, developed two rifles. His first, patented in 1870 and {{commonly referred}} to by collectors as the [...] "Model 1" [...] though it has no official designation, was a precursor to straight-pull bolt actions like the Mannlicher M1886. The second rifle designed by Robinson, patented in 1872, was very different, employing a double hinged action that folded upward from the receiver to remove the spent casing and back down and forward to chamber a new round. Though hammer-fired, it is recognizable as a manually actuated ancestor of the <b>toggle</b> <b>action</b> found in firearms such as the Luger Parabellum 1908 pistol or Pedersen Rifle.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, the C-93 Borchardt pistol was {{submitted}} for testing to the Swiss Military Trials Committee. The Committee found the Borchardt too heavy and unwieldy {{to serve as}} a military sidearm. Georg Luger was tasked by DWM with improving upon the Borchardt pistol. He developed the 7.65×21mm Parabellum cartridge from the 7.65×25mm Borchardt. By shortening the cartridge case, Luger was able to design a narrower grip, and the <b>toggle</b> <b>action</b> required a shorter stroke than in the original Borchardt design. A transitional Borchardt-Luger model in the new caliber {{was submitted}} to the Swiss commission in 1898. After further improvements, the final result became the DWM Pistole-Parabellum ("Luger pistol"). The loading for the new cartridge was standardized and mass production began in 1900-1901 in DWM's factory in Karlsruhe, Germany.|$|E
50|$|The Columbian {{press was}} invented by George Clymer, {{probably}} in 1813, inspired in some measure by the earlier Stanhope press. It was designed to allow a whole newspaper page to be printed in a single pull. The press worked by a lever system, {{similar to that of}} the Stanhope press and quite different from the <b>toggle</b> <b>action</b> of the slightler later English Albion press. Clymer's new iron press was first advertised in April 1814. It went on to be manufactured in great numbers for over a century, chiefly in the United Kingdom but also in other European countries (a few were manufactured in America, but no surviving examples are recorded). It is sometimes, incorrectly, referred to as the 'Eagle' press due to the characteristic bald eagle counterweight which usually sits on the top lever. Some Columbians have the counterweight in another form (a simple ornament, a lamp, urn, or orb).|$|E
40|$|We generalize Bender-Knuth {{promotion}} on linear extensions to {{an analogous}} action on increasing labelings of any finite poset, {{in which the}} restrictions on {{the values of the}} labels satisfy a natural consistency condition. We give an equivariant bijection between such increasing labelings under this generalized promotion and order ideals in an associated poset under rowmotion. Additionally, we give a criterion for when certain kinds of <b>toggle</b> group <b>actions</b> on order ideals of a finite poset will be conjugate to rowmotion. These results build upon work of O. Pechenik with the first two authors in the case of rectangular increasing tableaux and work of N. Williams with the second author relating promotion and rowmotion on ranked posets. We apply these results to posets embedded in the Cartesian product of ranked posets and increasing labelings with labels between 1 and q, in which case we obtain new instances of the resonance phenomenon.

50|$|The game {{followed}} the typical eight-way directional pad/stick with six-button layout common to most fighting {{games at the}} time (more commonly in this case, Street Fighter II). Since the standard Mega Drive/Genesis controller has only three action buttons, players would have to purchase a six-button controller or Sega Activator, or else use the start button to <b>toggle</b> the <b>action</b> buttons between punches and kicks. The joystick or D-pad is used to move away, towards, jump and crouch. There are three punches and three kicks that vary based upon speed and power. The weakest punches and kicks are fast but do minimal damage, medium attacks are a good mix of recovery speed and damage, and strong attacks are the most powerful but recover the slowest. Attacks can be blocked by pressing away (for high attacks) or down and away (for low attacks). Grapples are executed by standing close to an opponent and pressing toward or away and either medium or the strong punch button. These attacks cannot be blocked or escaped.|$|R
50|$|Most levels contain platforms, {{defined as}} {{anything}} {{able to change}} its height. Though it is generally used to describe lifts, doors are included in this category. Doors {{may or may not}} show up on the player's automap and are usually opened with the action key. In cases where they are damaged or locked they can be opened by special designated triggers or switches. Switches control various functions such as lifts, doors and lighting and {{come in the form of}} manual switches that can be <b>toggled</b> with the <b>action</b> key, stations for computer chips or breakable circuitry. Some switches are “tag” switches that execute multiple functions at once or those that must be activated as part of “repair” missions. Another notable level feature is teleporters, able to send players who use them to different parts of a level or to other levels. Aliens are unable to use them.|$|R
50|$|The Parabellum MG14 was a 7.9 mm caliber World War I {{machine gun}} built by Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken. It was a {{redesign}} of the Maschinengewehr 08 machine gun (itself {{an adaptation of}} the Maxim gun) system intended for use on aircraft and zeppelins, that used a <b>toggle</b> <b>action</b> that broke upwards rather than downwards opposite the MG 08, making for a much more compact receiver. The fusee spring was dispensed with for an internal spring design, the breech block was completely different and the spent cartridges dropped out {{the bottom of the}} receiver rather than forward through a hole in receiver. There appears to be no action or receiver parts interchangeable with the MG 08. The MG08's belt-style ammunition feed was enclosed in a drum, the recoil casing was lightened and the cooling jacket was modified for air- instead of water-cooling. The rate of fire was 700 rounds/minute. The belt was reduced to 30 mm in width.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral <b>Toggle</b> <b>action.</b> The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball bearing lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|E
