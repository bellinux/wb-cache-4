5|$|Via a live news report, a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging her head against <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>window.</b> As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.|$|E
5|$|Mulder's own {{problems}} arise when {{his cell phone}} rings and Krycek disappears from his car. Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>window</b> with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out. Krycek is about {{to pull the trigger}} when a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to pick his gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless. Krycek pushes his gun over and tells Skinner to shoot Mulder, telling him Mulder's life will grant him a thousand lives. Instead, Skinner raises his gun and shoots Krycek in the head. Doggett attempts to apprehend Rohrer and Crane but ends up being chased by the two. The pursuit ends up in the FBI garage and ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his car into the garage wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead.|$|E
500|$|Sam is a laid-back but enthusiastic, brown-coated {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "canine shamus". He wears {{either a}} gray or blue {{suit with a}} matching fedora, to make people more cooperative when conversing with a six-foot talking dog. A warped sense of justice makes Sam the more passionate of the pair for their police work, only held back from taking his job seriously by Max. Nevertheless, he enjoys the mannerisms and dress that come with their line of work. Sam possesses near encyclopedic amounts of knowledge, particularly on obscure topics, and is prone to long-winded sentences filled with elaborate terminology. Although he is always keen to display this information—regardless of its accuracy—Sam can be capable of total ignorance towards more practical matters; for instance, despite his regard for his DeSoto Adventurer, he is severely negligent with the car's maintenance. Sam still retains various doglike qualities: he is excitable, enthusiastic but also susceptible to emotions of embarrassment and guilt. Nevertheless, Sam is [...] "not above sticking his head out <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>window</b> and letting his tongue flap in the breeze". Sam rarely loses his temper, {{and is able to}} react to panic-inducing situations with extreme calm. When he does get angry, Sam tends to react in a violent, uncharacteristically savage manner, in which case it is usually Max that calms him down and prevents him from acting upon his anger. Sam usually is armed with an oversized [...]44 revolver.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, an {{advertisement}} for Apple Music featuring Goodrem was criticised by the Advertising Standards Bureau (ASB) for promoting unsafe driving. Complaints about the video to the Bureau stated that it [...] "does not promote safe driving" [...] and features Goodrem placing her head and arms outside a moving a vehicle and [...] "moving around in a motor vehicle with no clearly visible safety belt". In response to the complaints, Apple Inc. said that it felt [...] "confident" [...] that the advertisement didn't breach the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) Advertiser Code of Ethics standards and saw no issues relating to car safety, with both individuals in the car wearing lap seat belts. The ASB said that people may not realise that vintage cars are fitted with lap seatbelts which are not clearly seen in the video. The advertisement was pulled from screening and wouldn't re-air until Apple re-edited it with all parts featuring Goodrem's arms and hands outside of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>window</b> removed.|$|E

According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that I do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move! Fuck!” Of the seven shots fired by Yanez at point blank range, five hit Castile and two of those hit and pierced his heart.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Lewis was famously arrested outside Elvis Presley's Graceland {{home for}} {{allegedly}} intending to shoot him. [...] Lewis had already nearly killed his bass player, Butch Owens, on September 29 (Lewis's 41st birthday) when a [...]357 accidentally {{went off in}} his hand. In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography, Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Lewis explains that the reclusive Presley {{had been trying to}} reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to [...] "come out to the house." [...] Lewis replied that he would if he had time but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in Tunica, for driving under the influence. Later that night, Lewis was at a Memphis nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. [...] "Charles Feron, he owned Vapors, he give it to me," [...] Lewis explained to Bragg. [...] "A [...]38 derringer. Me, pretty well drunk, with that derringer – it ain't somethin' 'strange'." [...] Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new Lincoln Continental with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates because [...] "the nose of that Lincoln was a mile long." [...] Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle through <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>window,</b> not realizing it was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but [...] "Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening 'the', away in handcuffs." [...] Lewis said, [...] "The cops asked Elvis, 'What {{do you want us to}} do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." [...] Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. [...] Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mug shot was wired around the world. Presley died of a heart attack at Graceland eight months later.|$|E
