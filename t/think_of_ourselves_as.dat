25|$|According to Kant, we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> having free will. This lets us make {{judgments}} such as “you {{ought to have}} done that thing {{that you did not}} do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

6000|$|To a {{profound}} philosopher like myself, who am apt to see clear through a subject, where the penetration {{of ordinary people}} extends but half way, there is no fact more simple and manifest than that {{the death of a}} great man is a matter of very little importance. Much <b>as</b> we may <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>ourselves,</b> and much <b>as</b> we may excite the empty plaudits of the million, it is certain that the greatest among us do actually fill but an exceedingly small space in the world; and it is equally certain, that even that small space is quickly supplied when we leave it vacant. [...] "Of what consequence is it," [...] said Pliny, [...] "that individuals appear, or make their exit? the world is a theater whose scenes and actors are continually changing." [...] Never did philosopher speak more correctly, and I only wonder that so wise a remark could have existed so many ages, and mankind not have laid it more to heart. Sage follows on in the footsteps of sage; one hero just steps out of his triumphal car, {{to make way for the}} hero who comes after him; and of the proudest monarch it is merely said that, [...] "he slept with his fathers, and his successor reigned in his stead." ...|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} religious problems is that people fear having a relationship with God and consequently distance themselves from Him. Just as angels serve God without fear despite their lower status in comparison to God, so too human beings should take their model (walk amongst them) and not be afraid of developing a relationship with God and serving Him. This represents a wholeness that we as human beings are capable of only if we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> walking amongst angels. (Sfas Emes, Parshat Beha'alotecha 5636) ...|$|E

Pritilata was a meritorious student. A {{teacher in the}} school, whom students affectionately used called Usha Di, used stories of Rani Lakshmibai to inspire nationalism in her students. Kalpana Datta, a classmate of Pritilata, writes in the biography Chittagong Armoury Raiders– [...] "We had no clear idea in our school days about our future. Then the Rani of Jhansi fired our imagination with her example. Sometimes we used to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> fearless...". Arts and literature were Pritilata's favourite subjects. She passed out of Dr. Khastagir Government Girls' School in 1928 and in 1929, got admitted to the Eden College, Dhaka. In the Intermediate examinations, she stood first among all students who appeared in that year's examination from the Dhaka Board. As a student in Eden College, she participated in various social activities. She joined the group Sree Sangha, headed by Leela Nag, under the banner Dipali Sangha.|$|E

Ney has joined Soult, and there are 100,000 Frenchmen between us and our army. If I had any idea where Wilson is, we might endeavour to join him, for he must be in the same plight as ourselves. Our only chance, so far as I can see, is to cross their line of communications and to endeavour to join Beresford, who is reported as marching down the frontier from Almeida." ...|$|E
50|$|Because of this interplay, a person's {{negative}} thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, such as pessimistic {{predictions about}} the future, regretful ruminations upon the past, low self-esteem, and depleted belief in self-determination and a capacity to cope can undermine {{the efficiency of the}} immune system, increasing vulnerability to ill health. Simultaneously, the biochemical indicators of ill health monitored by the immune system feeds back to the brain via the nervous system, which exacerbates thoughts and feelings of a negative nature. That is to say, we feel and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> unwell, which contributes to physical conditions of ill health, which in turn cause us to feel and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> unwell.|$|E
