5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the <b>traumatic</b> <b>experience</b> of birth as a separation from the mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E

40|$|Childhood <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> {{have been}} {{suggested}} to relate to early-onset alcoholism and to negatively influence the severity and course of alcohol use disorders. Early-onset alcoholic (n = 54) and late-onset alcoholic (n = 65) inpatients were compared as to the severity of their childhood <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences,</b> prevalence of current and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depressive symptoms. The early-onset alcoholic patients had a higher number and more severe childhood <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> compared with the late-onset alcoholic patients. More female than male alcohol-dependent patients had lifetime PTSD diagnosis. Finally, specifically within the female alcoholic patients the severity of early childhood experiences was positively associated with the severity of current substance use and related problems.

40|$|Rationale : Early life stress (ELS) poses a {{risk for}} mental {{disorders}} and aging-related physical diseases. Accelerated biological aging reflected in shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) may underlie these risks. Yet, studies examining associations between ELS and LTL have been scanty, elusive, and retrospective. We examined if objectively documented ELS in childhood, retrospectively, reported <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> across the lifespan and whether their combination {{is associated with}} LTL in later adulthood. Methods : ELS, <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences,</b> and LTL were present in 1, 486 participants of the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study, born between 1934 and&#x 2013; 44 in Helsinki, Finland. Of them 215 were recorded as separated temporarily from their parents in childhood. The separations took place during World War II when Finnish children were voluntarily evacuated unaccompanied by their parents to temporary foster care abroad (mean age at and length of separation 4. 6 and 1. 7 years, respectively). <b>Traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> across the lifespan were self-reported at age 63. 2 years (SD&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 2. 8) using the <b>Traumatic</b> <b>Experiences</b> Checklist, and LTL was measured at age 61. 5 years (SD&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 2. 9) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Results : LTL {{did not differ significantly}} by separation status or by having experienced traumas (p&#x 003 E; 0. 151). However, ELS and <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> interacted significantly in the analyses of LTL (p&# 60; 0. 008). Those participants who were separated and had experienced an emotional trauma across the lifespan displayed shorter LTL than those who were not separated regardless of their <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences.</b> In contrast, those participants who were separated but who had not experienced an emotional trauma did not differ in LTL from the non-separated. Conclusion : ELS and <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> may, in combination, contribute to accelerated cellular aging and shed light into the underlying mechanisms linking ELS and early <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> with mental disorders and aging-related diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDepression may {{severely}} affect {{adolescents in}} sundry areas. Research demonstrates that girls have greater prevalence of depression than boys since adolescence and that <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> are predictors of depression. The present study aims to explore if <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> are predictors {{of depressive symptoms}} in adolescence and if gender moderates that relationship. The participants were 319 adolescents aged between 13 and 15 years old, attending the 8 th and 9 th grade in public schools, who participated in a Portuguese study about prevention of adolescent depression. Self-report questionnaires {{were used to assess}} <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences,</b> measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and depressive symptoms, measured by The Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI). Results showed that the female gender had higher levels of depressive symptoms and also demonstrated a significant correlation between depressive symptoms, emotional abuse and emotional neglect for both genders. Furthermore, these <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> were predictors of depressive symptoms and a moderating effect of gender on the relationship between emotional neglect and depressive symptoms was found. This moderating effect suggests that for the same levels of emotional neglect girls showed higher levels of depressive symptoms. These findings emphasize the contribution of the emotional component of <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> on depression...|$|R

5|$|SASO decided after {{a debate}} to remain non-affiliated with NUSAS, but would {{nevertheless}} recognise the larger organisation {{as the national}} student body. One of SASO's founding resolutions was to send a representative to each NUSAS conference.

SASO's split from NUSAS was a <b>traumatic</b> <b>experience</b> for many white liberal youth who had committed themselves {{to the idea of}} a multi-racial organisation and felt that their attempts were being rebuffed. The NUSAS leadership regretted the split, but largely refrained from criticising SASO. The government—which regarded multi-racial liberalism as a threat and had banned multi-racial political parties in 1968—was pleased with SASO's emergence, regarding it as a victory of apartheid thinking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, the {{establishment}} of Russian naval power in the Baltic challenged the interests of Sweden, at the time {{one of the major}} powers in the Baltic. The Swedish Empire at the time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the Baltic states, a dominion held together by the Baltic sea routes. Russian Tsar Peter the Great had established a new capital and naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703. During the Great Northern War 1700–1721 Sweden lost its Baltic state territories, and experienced destructive Russian raiding in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos that stretched {{all the way from the}} Gulf of Finland to the capital of Stockholm. The <b>traumatic</b> <b>experience</b> led to {{the establishment of}} inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels. The first of these consisted mainly of smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean warship, the galleys. Most of these more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams. The disastrous war against Russia 1741-43 and the minor involvement in Prussia in the Pomeranian War 1757–62 showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} between <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences,</b> alexithymia, {{and substance abuse}} is well established.

In the present study, self-report measures on <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences,</b> alexithymia, and problematic Internet use were administered to 358 high school students (57 % females) aged 18 - 19 years old, to test whether alexithymic traits mediated the relationship between <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> and Internet addiction symptoms, and whether gender moderated the proposed mediation in the sample. While partial mediation occurred in the entire sample, gender directly affected the relationship between the investigated constructs: Internet addiction symptoms were independently related to <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> among males, and to alexithymic traits among females. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} suggest that trauma memories among males, and problems with affect regulation among females, may increase the risk of problematic Internet use during late adolescence. Such findings might have relevant implications to inform any treatment plan for late adolescent students who are overinvolved with online activities, pointing out that tailored approaches to their problems and difficulties are particularly needed in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Background: Only a few {{population-based}} {{studies on}} the epidemiology of post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) are available to date. Most of the existing studies are from the U. S. A. Against the background of World War II, the extent and long-term effects of war-related <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> in the German elderly population are of special interest. Nevertheless, population-based data on this topic are lacking to date. Methods: This study examines the occurrence of <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> and the prevalence rates of PTSD according to DSM-IV and of partial PTSD in a randomly selected sample of the German general population aged 60 years and over (N = 814) using self-rating instruments. Results: PTSD is apparent in 3. 4 %; when partial post-traumatic stress syndromes are included, a total of 7. 2 % of the aged population are involved. The most common individual symptoms resulting from war-induced trauma are avoidance of thoughts and feelings, sleep disturbances, distressing dreams and intrusive thoughts. The most frequently mentioned <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> of the generation {{examined in this study}} were war-related trauma experienced as children or in early adulthood during World War II. As a person's age increases, so does the prevalence of war-related <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences.</b> There are some gender differences in <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences,</b> but not in post-traumatic symptoms.

Our sample consisted of 195 patients with psychotic disorders (74 % diagnosed with schizophrenia) and 132 controls. Cluster analyses were conducted to identify and validate distinct personality profiles. General linear model analyses were conducted to examine whether patients with different profiles differed in social functioning and quality of life (QoL), while controlling for possible confounders. Mediation models were tested to assess potential causal links. In general, patients with higher levels of self-reported <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> (PT+) showed lower QoL and more social withdrawal compared with patients with lower <b>traumatic</b> <b>experiences</b> (PT-).
