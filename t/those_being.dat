5|$|Born in 1989, Liukin was {{ten months}} {{too young to}} compete as a senior in 2004, and thus was not {{eligible}} for {{a place on the}} U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.

Since 1899, the record has only been surpassed six times, <b>those</b> <b>being</b> the Amite-Purvis Tornado in 1908, the Tri-State Tornado in 1925, the Tupelo and Gainesville tornadoes in 1936, the 1947 Woodward Tornado and most recently the 2011 Joplin Tornado.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{restoration}} of King Charles II to the throne in 1660, the Royalist Sir Peter Killigrew became the new captain of the castle. Fears of an invasion continued, and an additional gun battery was constructed at Crab Quay, to the south-east of the main fortification.

5|$|The Glacier Bay {{has many}} branches, inlets, lagoons, islands, and {{channels}} that holds prospects for scientific exploration and visual treat. Thus, {{the area is}} popular as a cruise ship destination during summer season. However, there are restrictions imposed by the National Park Service on the numbers of vessels that can operate in a day to 2 cruise ships, 3 tour boats, 6 charter vessels, and 25 private vessels. According to National Park Service statistics for calendar year 2009, 444,653 people visited Glacier Bay, with 422,919 of <b>those</b> <b>being</b> cruise ship passengers.|$|E

Both his age and bad health induced him to make a public refusal of the position, still never offered to him officially.|$|E

5|$|After 2013–14 ended York {{released}} Tom Allan, Calvin Andrew, Chris Dickinson, Shaq McDonald, Sander Puri and Adam Reed, with David McGurk {{retiring from}} professional football. Ryan Bowman and Lanre Oyebanjo left {{the club to}} sign for Torquay United and Crawley Town respectively, but Michael Coulson signed a new contract. Worthington made eight signings before the season kicked-off, <b>those</b> <b>being</b> goalkeeper Jason Mooney from Tranmere Rovers, defenders Femi Ilesanmi from Dagenham & Redbridge, Marvin McCoy from Wycombe Wanderers and Dave Winfield from Shrewsbury Town, midfielders Lindon Meikle from Mansfield Town, Anthony Straker from Southend United and Luke Summerfield from Shrewsbury, and striker Jake Hyde from Barnet.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of 2015–16, York {{released}} Wes Fletcher, Ryan Jarvis, Lewis Montrose and Danny Parslow, while Jason Mooney {{left for}} Accrington Stanley.

Midfielder Callum Rzonca entered the first-team squad from the youth team after agreeing a professional contract.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of <b>those</b> <b>being</b> NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
50|$|Alien Intelligences are {{perceived}} by {{the vast majority of}} sentient beings everywhere in the Megaverse as creatures of pure evil intent, and with good reason. While many (perhaps most) Alien Intelligences do indeed gain a great deal of amusement from the suffering of other beings, {{for the vast majority of}} Intelligences, the simple fact of the matter is that they consider themselves as far above most sentient <b>beings</b> as <b>those</b> sentient <b>beings</b> consider themselves above pets and livestock, and treat <b>those</b> <b>beings</b> as such. Even Gods, Angels, Demons, and lesser Alien Intelligences are potentially susceptible to being treated as nothing more than pawns, slaves, and in some cases, food.|$|R
50|$|Beri'ah is {{the first}} of the four worlds to be created ex nihilo, since Atzilut was emanated rather than created.

5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from <b>those</b> <b>being</b> asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 the Welsh Assembly Government asked Network Rail {{to conduct}} {{feasibility}} studies on two former track stretches in Wales, one of <b>those</b> <b>being</b> {{the line from}} Bangor to Llangefni. Councillor Clive McGregor was optimistic this could provide an economic stimulus for Anglesey, along with further proposals to extend passenger traffic between Llangefni and Amlwch. In 2011 Network Rail began work on gathering evidence for its study, beginning with cutting away vegetation on track sections to examine the condition of rails and track bedding. Its report {{was expected to be}} published in 2012, before any business cases to reopen the lines could be developed.|$|E
