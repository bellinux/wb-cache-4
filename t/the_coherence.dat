5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within <b>the</b> <b>coherence</b> {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by <b>the</b> <b>coherence</b> length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then {{he should be able to}} create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E

Materials and Methods: <b>The</b> wavelet <b>coherence</b> phase was computed for a group of four subjects using three functional runs of different visual stimulation lengths. In order to consider the variability of <b>the</b> wavelet <b>coherence</b> phase, a correlation analysis was performed between the variance of the phase shift and the associated activation strength. In activated brain regions, correlation was performed between <b>the</b> mean wavelet <b>coherence</b> phase and <b>the</b> spectral density phase shift. Results: The scalograms of <b>the</b> wavelet <b>coherence</b> phase show <b>the</b> temporal variability of the phase shift between fMRI time series. For brain regions with weakly stationary behavior, <b>the</b> mean wavelet <b>coherence</b> phase supports <b>the</b> results obtained by spectral analyses. Conclusion: <b>The</b> wavelet <b>coherence</b> phase provides a description of the temporal behavior of the BOLD signal even for the nonstationary case. In particular, temporal changes of the phase shift can be investigated.

40|$|International audienceA {{detailed}} analysis is performed {{to show that}} the second order time-convolutionless master equation fails to describe the exciton-phonon dynamics in a finite size lattice. To proceed, special attention is paid to characterize <b>the</b> <b>coherences</b> of <b>the</b> exciton reduced density matrix.

It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>coherences</b> behave as wave functions whose dynamics is governed by a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian defined in terms of the so-called time-dependent relaxation operator. Due to the confinement, quantum recurrences provide to the relaxation operator an almost periodic nature so that the master equation reduces to a linear system of differential equations with almost periodic coefficients. In accordance with the Floquet theory, we show that unstable solutions emerge due to parametric resonances involving specific frequencies of the relaxation operator and specific excitonic eigenfrequencies.

40|$|Discussion {{begins with}} a brief account of atomic level-pumping and reasons why atomic {{coherence}} is typically not considered in cw work on optical interactions. This dissertation is divided into four parts: semiclassical treatments of one-photon electric- dipole atom-field single-mode interactions and multimode interactions, and corresponding treatments for the two-photon interaction. We present the effects of injected atomic <b>coherence</b> on <b>the</b> polarization of the medium, the slowly varying envelope wave equation, the single- and multiwave mixing coefficients, and weak field propagation in a homogeneously broadened two-level medium. Spatial and temporal phase matching of <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence</b> to a field mode is crucial throughout, since the field {{may not be able}} to remain in phase with the induced and injected polarizations. One-photon injected coherence contributes directly to the polarization at the atomic resonance frequency. The perfectly phase-matched case leads to a linear superposition of an exponentially decaying field (Beer's law) and a constant field driven by <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence.</b> <b>The</b> interaction of an injected coherence with a detuned field produces frequency-symmetric sidebands about the pump field polarization. The sideband spacing equals the atom-field detuning. To probe <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence</b> we inject a weak resonant field. The resulting three-wave mixing leads to multiwave mixing coefficients that are unaffected to first-order in the weak sidemodes, but <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence</b> adds inhomogeneous terms to the coupled-mode equations. For both single- and multimode interactions <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence</b> does not affect the exponential growth/decay of the sidemodes, but it supports a weak field that may propagate if properly phase matched. For two-photon media <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence</b> requires at least one field interaction in order to produce a polarization, which then appears in the single- and multiwave mixing coefficients. The exponential growth/decay rate is modified by <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence.</b> For a centrally-tuned pump <b>the</b> injected <b>coherence</b> contributes <b>the</b> standard multiwave mixing terms as well as additional effects.
