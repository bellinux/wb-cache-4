40|$|Abstract: Data on air {{and road}} surface {{temperatures}} not beeing available, climatological {{data from the}} site of the meteorological station have been used to determine the temperature relations needed for predicting road slipperiness. The analysis has been made for the cold period of the year (September to May) for the 10 -year period 1971 - 1980 at the Zagreb-Maksimir station, located in the Sava River valley at the foot of Mount Medvednica. The analysis involves the relations between minimum air <b>temperatures</b> <b>at</b> two levels, 2 m and 5 cm as well as between minimum air <b>temperatures</b> <b>at</b> 2 m height and soil <b>temperatures</b> <b>at</b> 5 cm depth at 7 a. m. during various weather situations, defined according to average cloudiness, wind conditions, fog and frozen ground during the night preceding the occurrence of minimum temperatures. In weather situations with prevailing radiation processes (clear/calm and partly cloudy/calm), the minimum surface air temperatures are always lower than at 2 m height. On the other hand, after cloudy nights, regardless of wind velocity, the minimum surface temperatures are lower than those at 2 m only above determined temperature levels. The minimum air <b>temperatures</b> <b>at</b> 5 cm height are lower than 0 °C when the minimum <b>temperatures</b> <b>at</b> 2 m height are lower than 3 °C during clear/calm, clear/windy and partly cloudy/calm situations. During partly cloudy/windy, cloudy/calm and cloudy/windy situations, the differences between minimum <b>temperatures</b> <b>at</b> these two levels are smaller, and consequently, negative minimum surface temperatures appear if the minimum <b>temperatures</b> <b>at</b> 2 m are about 0 °C. The relations between minimum air temperatures and soil temperatures do not differ significantly for different weather types. However, they differ considerably from month to month. According to these conclusions, soil temperatures should be predicted particularly by means of regression equations obtained for each month...|$|R
5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb <b>temperature</b> <b>at</b> 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain <b>temperature</b> <b>at</b> each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E
