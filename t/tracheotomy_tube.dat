50|$|Significant {{improvements}} to surgical instruments for tracheotomy include the direct suction <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube</b> invented by Josephine G. Fountain (RN); she was awarded patent no. 3039469 in 1962 for the direct suction <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube,</b> which improved the ways mucus could be cleared from the trachea and increased patient breathing and comfort.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} of the direct suction <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube</b> {{is found in the}} way it addressed a persistent complication in tracheotomy operations; where the mucous secretions within a patient's trachea block a portion of the inner cannula tube and attempting to remedy the situation by inserting suction tube further blocks a patient's airways. As a result, the patient feels insecure and has trouble breathing. Fountain's patent for the direct suction <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube</b> answered this issue. The invention also was an improved <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube</b> that allowed introduction of gases other than air without reducing the diameter of the tube.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{surface of}} {{polymeric}} <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes</b> is a favourable environment for biofilm formation and therefore represents a potential {{risk factor for}} the development of pneumonia after tracheotomy. The aim of this in-vitro study was to develop octenidine-dihydrochloride (OCT) coated polymer <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes</b> and investigate any effects on Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa colonization. Additionally the resistance of the OCT coating was tested using reprocessing procedures like brushing, rinsing and disinfection with glutaraldehyde Results Contamination with S. aureus : Before any reprocessing, OCT coated <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes</b> were colonized with 10 3 cfu/ml and uncoated <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes</b> with 10 5 cfu/ml (P = 0. 045). After reprocessing, no differences in bacterial concentration between modified and conventional tubes were observed. Contamination with P. aeruginosa : Before reprocessing, OCT coated tubes were colonized with 10 6 cfu/ml and uncoated tubes with 10 7 cfu/ml (P = 0. 006). After reprocessing, no significant differences were observed. Conclusion OCT coating initially inhibits S. aureus and P. aeruginosa colonisation on <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> This effect, however, vanishes quickly after reprocessing of the tubes due to poor adhesive properties of the antimicrobial compound. Despite the known antimicrobial effect of OCT, its use for antimicrobial coating of <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes</b> is limited unless methods are developed to allow sustained attachment to the tube. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of review: Biofilms {{have been}} shown {{to play a role in}} otitis media, sinusitis, cholesteatoma, tonsillitis, adenoiditis, and device infections. This article is written to review recent {{advances}} in the field. RECENT Findings: The role of biofilms in the persistence of chronic, mucosal-based ENT-related infections was first recognized in otitis media. Definitive proof was lacking until the demonstration of bacterial biofilms on the middle-ear mucosa of children, not only with chronic otitis media with effusion, but also with recurrent otitis media. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cholesteatoma are avid biofilm formers. Biofilms have been reported in the adenoids of children with chronic rhinosinusitis, helping to explain the clinical observation that adenoidectomy can be beneficial to children with chronic otitis or chronic rhinosinusiti. Additional studies have confirmed the presence of biofilms in chronic tonsillitis. Biofilms have also been shown to be involved in infected cochlear implants and <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> Summary: The recognition that chronic otolaryngologic bacterial infections are biofilm related has been the impetus for the development of new technologies for the study of biofilms and their prevention and treatment.

50|$|Once the incisions {{are made}} by the tracheotome and the stomas are accessible, tracheotome tubes are placed in the trachea to provide oxygen to the lungs. Tubes have also been {{improved}} to reduce complications of infection and tissue damage. For instance, Alain Milhay from Amiens, France, invented a <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube</b> with shield for anesthesia in 1983. This tube included a conduit for passing on anesthesia and ventilation gases. At the time, other tubes were also been implemented for anesthesia application but their material composition was toxic and could give off caustic or toxic vapors.|$|E
5000|$|Modern [...] "volume ventilators/respirators," [...] which {{deliver an}} {{adjustable}} volume (amount) of {{air to the}} person with each breath, are valuable {{in the treatment of}} people with muscular dystrophy-related respiratory problems. The ventilator may require an invasive endotracheal or <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube</b> through which air is directly delivered, but for some people, noninvasive delivery through a face mask or mouthpiece is sufficient. Positive airway pressure machines, particularly bilevel ones, are sometimes used in this latter way. The respiratory equipment may easily fit on a ventilator tray on the bottom or back of a power wheelchair with an external battery for portability.|$|E
50|$|The best {{position}} for a tracheotomy {{was and still is}} one that forces the neck into the biggest prominence. Usually, the patient was laid on his back on a table with a cushion placed under his shoulders to prop him up. The arms were restrained to ensure they would not get in the way later. The tools and techniques used today in tracheotomies have come a long way. The <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tube</b> placed into the incision through the windpipe comes in various sizes, thus allowing a more comfortable fit and the ability to remove the tube {{in and out of the}} throat without disrupting support from a breathing machine. In today’s world general anesthesia is used when performing these surgeries, which makes it much more tolerable for the patient. Special tracheostomy tube valves (such as the Passy-Muir valve) have been created to assist people in their speech. The patient can inhale through the unidirectional tube. Upon expiration, pressure causes the valve to close, redirecting air around the tube, past the vocal folds, producing sound.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, some {{surgeons}} had become proficient in performing the tracheotomy procedure. The main instruments used were:“Two small scalpels, one short grooved director, a tenaculum, two aneurysm needles {{which may be}} used as retractors, one pair of artery forceps, haemostatic forceps, two pairs of dissecting forceps, a pair of scissors, a sharp-pointed tenotome, a pair of tracheal forceps, a tracheal dilator, <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes,</b> ligatures, sponges, a flexible catheter, and feathers”.Haemostatic forceps were used to control bleeding from separated vessels that were not ligatured because of the urgency of the operation. Generally, they were used to expose the trachea by clamping the isthmus thyroid gland on both sides. To open the trachea physically, a sharp-pointed tentome allowed the surgeon easily to place the ends into the opening of the trachea. The thin points permitted the doctor a better view of his incision. Tracheal dilators, such as the “Golding Bird”, were placed through the opening and then expanded by “turning the screw to which they are attached.” Tracheal forceps, as displayed on the right, were commonly used to extract foreign bodies from the larynx. The optimum tracheal tube at the time caused very little damage to the trachea and “mucus membrane”.|$|R
40|$|Nasogastric tubes {{have been}} shown to cause damage to the pharyngolaryngeal complex, {{producing}} laryngeal inflammation, granulation, muscle damage, and even vocal cord im-mobility. The coexistence of nasogastric and <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes</b> after conservation laryngeal surgery is especially harmful. The friction between these two semirigid structures may result in damage to the remaining pad of the larynx. This may result in a significant delay in healing, oral feeding, and decannulafion. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is a possible solution. This procedure requires time, special expertise, and cooperation between services. We present our experience with t 7 transcutaneous cervical miniesophagostomies using a small-caliber feeding tube, which were performed during conservation laryngeal and/or pharyngeal surgery. The rate of minor complications was 11. 7 %, or 0. 40 complications per 100 tube days, and no major complications were related to the procedure. Transcutaneous cervical miniesophagos-tomy is a simple and quick procedure that may be performed during the primary cancer surgery. It is done by the head and neck surgeon and does not require special expertise. It takes about 5 minutes to perform and, if done correctly with tunneling under skin flaps, is associated with minimal or no postoperative morbidity.

40|$|Tracheotomy is a {{commonly}} performed procedure. The Belgian Society of Pneumology (BVP-SBP) and the Belgian Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (BACTS) developed guidelines on tracheotomy for mechanical ventilation in adults. The levels of evidence as {{developed by the}} American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) were used. The members of the guideline committee reviewed peer-reviewed publications on this subject. After discussion, a proposal of guidelines {{was placed on the}} website for remarks and suggestions of the members. Remarks and suggestions were discussed and used to adapt the guidelines when judged necessary. The different techniques of tracheotomy are described. The potential advantages and disadvantages of surgical and percutaneous tracheotomy versus endotracheal intubation are discussed. An overview of early and late complications is given. Low-pressure, high-volume cuffs should be used. The cuff pressure should be monitored with calibrated devices and recorded at least once every nursing shift and after manipulation of the <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> Inspired gas should be humidified and heated. Regarding the timing of tracheotomy there are not enough well-designed studies to establish clear guidelines. Therefore, the timing of tracheotomy should be individualised. In critically ill adult patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheotomy performed at an early stage (within the first week) may shorten the duration of artificial ventilation and length of stay in intensive care. Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) appears to be at least as safe as surgical tracheotomy (ST) as measured in terms of peri-procedural complications. With PDT, less wound infection is observed. When PDT is compared to ST performed in the operating room, PDT is less expensive, reduces the time between the decision and the performance of tracheotomy and has a lower mortality rate. Different techniques of PDT are discussed. We recommend performing PDT under bronchoscopic guidance. Because of its technical simplicity and short procedure time, the modified Ciaglia Blue Rhino technique is advocated as technique of choice. PDT should be considered the procedure of choice in elective non-urgent tracheotomy. There are some relative contraindications for PDT, but with growing experience, they become less frequent. © 2007 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate endotracheal cuff pressure and/or <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>tubes</b> at zero, 30 and 60 degrees inclination of the patient's bed head section in adult intensive care units. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out evaluating the cuff pressure, the expiratory tidal volume (VT) and the peak airway pressure (PP) at inclinations zero, 30 and 60 degree of the head section of the patients' bed. The 30 degree inclination was considered the standard position used as control to analyze values in the zero and 60 degree positions, which were randomly ordered. The Student's t test was used and was considered significant when p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A sample of 12 women and 12 men with a mean age of 51. 29 ± 19. 55 years was surveyed. When inclination of the bed head section was changed from 30 to zero degrees, there was a 16. 9 % mean reduction of the cuff pressure and 11. 8 % mean increase of the PP. On the other hand, changing the position from 30 to 60 degrees caused a mean reduction of 18. 8 % in the cuff pressure and a mean increase of 13. 3 % in the PP.

To discover the process of parent-nurse communication that results in mutual understanding of the child’s plan of care, a grounded theory study to explore the perspectives of the parents of previously hospitalized technology {{dependent children}} was undertaken. The Theory of Shared Communication emerged from the data and illuminates the parent-nurse communication process. The antecedents of the process are respect for own and others expertise. The communication process consists of six communication behaviors; ask, listen, explain, advocate, verify understanding and negotiate roles. The behaviors are nested within each other and all are not necessarily required for the non-linear process to result in the relational outcome of mutual understanding of the child’s plan of care. An integrative review of the literature regarding the process of communication between parents of hospitalized chronically ill children and their nurses shed light on the components of the process, but no study was found that explicated the entire communication process.
