40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 60) The {{objective of}} the air test {{was to determine the}} velocity and pressure profile of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump (HPOTP) inlet flow. The HPOTP inlet has two rows of turning vanes. The first has 15 vanes and the second row has 5 vanes. This experiment was performed by flowing air through a HPOTP inlet without any rotating machinery. The velocity components, <b>total</b> <b>pressures</b> and static pressures were measured, downstream of the inlet, by a five hole pressure probe. The probe was traversed circumferentially 360 degrees, in one-degree increments, at four radial positions to sufficiently define the flow field. Plots were generated describing the three velocity components, <b>total</b> <b>pressures</b> and static pressures of the flow field, also, plots of incidence angles of the flow with a rotating inducer. The velocity and pressure profile displayed seven wakes near the inducer blade tip location. The wakes are flow streamlines that have low axial velocities and low <b>total</b> <b>pressures</b> due to losses. The wakes were produced by combinations of flow separation off the inlet turning vanes, boundary layer buildup and abrupt flow area change. Near the inducer hub location the wakes were less in number and lower in magnitude. The vanes which produced the wakes were identified in the report. (See more in text. ...|$|R

25|$|Three main {{driving forces}} used in {{different}} version of diffusion models are moisture content, the partial pressure of water vapour, and the chemical potential (Skaar, 1988; Keey et al., 2000).

25|$|Lateral earth {{pressures}} are zero {{at the top}} of the wall and – in homogenous ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed.

25|$|The {{masses of}} the gases to be mixed must be {{calculated}} based on the final partial pressure ratio and <b>total</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the cylinder is filled to the appropriate weight corresponding to the added weight of each component. The advantage of this system is that temperature {{does not affect the}} accuracy, as pressure is not measured during the process. The disadvantage is that helium has a much lower density than the other components, and a small error in measured mass of helium will result in a relatively large error in composition.|$|E
25|$|Dalton's law {{states that}} the <b>total</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is the sum of}} the partial {{pressures}} of each individual component in the mixture. When a multi-component liquid is heated, the vapor pressure of each component will rise, thus causing the total vapor pressure to rise. When the total vapor pressure reaches the pressure surrounding the liquid, boiling occurs and liquid turns to gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. Note that a mixture with a given composition has one boiling point at a given pressure, when the components are mutually soluble. A mixture of constant composition does not have multiple boiling points.|$|E

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{conducted}} {{joint research}} to evaluate explosion blast effects on typical U. S. mine ventilation stoppings in the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (PRL) Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM). An innovative Australian-designed brattice stop-ping was also evaluated. After mine explosion accidents, MSHA conducts investigations {{to determine the}} cause(s) {{as a means to}} prevent future occurrences. As part of these postexplosion investigations, the condition of underground stoppings, including the debris from damaged stoppings, is documented as evidence of the approximate strength and the direction of the explosion forces. The LLEM data showed that a typical dry-stacked and coated solid-concrete-block stopping survived a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 6. 7 psi (46 kPa) and was destroyed at a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 7. 6 psi (52 kPa). In comparison, a typical dry-stacked and coated hollow-core concrete block stopping survived a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 3. 4 - 4. 3 psi (23 - 30 kPa) and was destroyed at a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 3. 6 - 5. 2 psi (25 - 36 kPa), depending on the length of the pressure pulse and the value of the pressure-time integral. A typical steel panel stopping design survived a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 0. 8 psi (5. 5 kPa) and failed at a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 1. 3 psi (9 kPa). The LLEM data also showed that an obstacle blocking the path of a pressure wave resulted in a higher reflected pressure at the obstacle. An 8 -in (20 -cm) thick wet-laid solid-concrete-block stopping coated on one side survived a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 26 psi (180 kPa); this stopping was not tested to failure. A 6 -in (15 -cm) thick wet-laid solid-concrete-block stopping coated on one side survived a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 14 psi (97 kPa) and was destroyed at a <b>total</b> explosion <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi (172 kPa). An innovative Australian woven cloth stopping survived an explosion pressure of 4. 0 psi (27 kPa) and was destroyed at an explosion pressure of 6. 1 psi (42 kPa). These results will help investigators determine the approximate explosion forces that destroy or damage stoppings during actual coal mine explosions...|$|R
30|$|Secondly, as {{a spatial}} variation, the {{equatorial}} plasma bubble occurring after post-sunset {{has been identified}} (e.g., Stolle et al. 2006; Park et al. 2009 a). Pressure inside the plasma is smaller than that outside. Balancing the <b>total</b> <b>pressures</b> on both sides, magnetic pressure inside increases compared to that outside, {{which means that the}} parallel component to the geomagnetic main field is not zero.|$|R
25|$|The {{shock wave}} {{is one of}} several {{different}} ways in which a gas in a supersonic flow can be compressed. Some other methods are isentropic compressions, including Prandtl-Meyer compressions. The method of compression of a gas results in different temperatures and densities for a given pressure ratio which can be analytically calculated for a non-reacting gas. A shock wave compression results in a loss of <b>total</b> <b>pressure,</b> meaning that it is a less efficient method of compressing gases for some purposes, for instance in the intake of a scramjet. The appearance of pressure-drag on supersonic aircraft is mostly due to the effect of shock compression on the flow.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{metabolic}} {{reduction of}} total gas {{pressure in the}} tissues. The sum of partial pressures of the gas that the diver breathes must necessarily balance with the sum of partial pressures in the lung gas. In the alveoli the gas has been humidified by a partial pressure of approximately 63mbar (47mmHg) and has gained about 55mbar (41mmHg) carbon dioxide from the venous blood. Oxygen has also diffused into the arterial blood, reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli by about 67mbar(50mmHg) As the <b>total</b> <b>pressure</b> in the alveoli must balance with the ambient pressure, this dilution results in an effective partial pressure of nitrogen of about 758mb (569mmHg) in air at normal atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|Of course, the {{reactants}} {{should also}} be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the <b>total</b> <b>pressure</b> is fixed, this means that density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller {{than that of the}} hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(Z+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of /T2. On the other hand, because the - reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.|$|E

25|$|At {{a steady}} state, when the tissues have been {{saturated}} by the inert gases of the breathing mixture, metabolic processes reduce the partial {{pressure of the}} less soluble oxygen {{and replace it with}} carbon dioxide, which is considerably more soluble in water. In the cells of a typical tissue, the partial pressure of oxygen will drop to around 13mbar (10mmHg), while the partial pressure of carbon dioxide will be about 65mbar (49mmHg). The sum of these partial pressures (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) comes to roughly 900mbar (675mmHg), which is some 113mbar (85mmHg) less than the <b>total</b> <b>pressure</b> of the respiratory gas. This is a significant saturation deficit, and it provides a buffer against supersaturation and a driving force for dissolving bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Relative humidity: The {{relative}} humidity of air {{is defined as}} the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated vapour pressure at the same temperature and <b>total</b> <b>pressure</b> (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased moisture gradient in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the {{relative humidity}} of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the absolute humidity, which is the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air).However, its influenced by the amount of water in the heated air.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} {{effects of}} a tropical cyclone will cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of low atmospheric pressure and fall in regions of high atmospheric pressure.
