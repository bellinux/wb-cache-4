In order to understand how <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> maintenance techniques are practiced in the gaming industry, several key elements must be examined. First, specific <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> maintenance techniques that are most useful for video games must be analyzed to understand their effectiveness. Second, the processes used for <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> maintaining video games {{at the beginning of}} the industry must be reviewed in order to see how far <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> maintenance techniques have progressed.
