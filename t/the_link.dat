5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E
