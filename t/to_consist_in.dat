The score was <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>in</b> arrangements of the official Chrono Trigger soundtrack written by Yasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu and Noriko Matsueda. Valente's goal was to retain the feeling of the original music while enhancing it for a modern platform. Most of the arrangements were created in the Impulse Tracker format, then converted to MIDI and enhanced with a number of tools.|$|E
5|$|There are six main plot {{lines that}} the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Each scenario is divided into eight episodes, one interlude episode and an epilogue. At the end of an episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of what is <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>in</b> the next episode. Each episode takes place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one through the epilogue. The interlude episode is placed between the second and third episodes.|$|E

500|$|During the Maastrichtian age, much of Europe was {{fragmented}} into islands, and {{a number}} of the bizarre features of Balaur are thought to be a result of an [...] "island effect", the relatively isolated conditions imposed on many of the populations in this area. Species which are isolated on islands can be subject to the effects of genetic drift and the founder effect which can magnify the effect of mutations which might be diluted in a larger population. Other island effects such as Foster's rule, which describes how small mainland species become larger and large mainland species become smaller, can take effect. Cretaceous Romania is known, for example, for its dwarf sauropods. In 2010, this island effect was assumed <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>in</b> rapid changes in a relatively recently arrived invading species and not seen as the result of an isolated development of an endemic form during tens of millions of years. The assumed close relationship to Velociraptor would have implied that the isolation of Haţeg Island must have been relative and intermittent.|$|E

Brown, held that separation of the races was not inherently unequal, and any inferiority felt by blacks at having to use separate facilities was an illusion: [...] "We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>in</b> the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of any-thing found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it."

2500|$|B. Hiley and R. E. Callaghan re-interpret {{the role}} of the Bohm model and its notion of quantum {{potential}} in the framework of Clifford algebra, taking account of recent advances that include the work of David Hestenes on spacetime algebra. They show how, within a nested hierarchy of Clifford algebras , for each Clifford algebra an element of a minimal left ideal [...] and an element of a right ideal representing its Clifford conjugation [...] can be constructed, and from it the Clifford density element (CDE) , an element of the Clifford algebra which is isomorphic to the standard density matrix but independent of any specific representation. On this basis, bilinear invariants can be formed which represent properties of the system. Hiley and Callaghan distinguish bilinear invariants of a first kind, of which each stands for the expectation value of an element [...] of the algebra which can be formed as , and bilinear invariants of a second kind which are constructed with derivatives and represent momentum and energy. Using these terms, they reconstruct the results of quantum mechanics without depending on a particular representation in terms of a wave function nor requiring reference to an external Hilbert space. Consistent with earlier results, the quantum potential of a non-relativistic particle with spin (Pauli particle) is shown to have an additional spin-dependent term, and the momentum of a relativistic particle with spin (Dirac particle) is shown <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>in</b> a linear motion and a rotational part. The two dynamical equations governing the time evolution are re-interpreted as conservation equations. One of them stands for the conservation of energy; the other stands for the conservation of probability and of spin. The quantum potential plays {{the role of}} an internal energy which ensures the conservation of total energy.|$|E
