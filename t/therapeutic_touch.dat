25|$|It is more {{acceptable}} {{for women to}} touch than men in social or friendship settings, possibly because of the inherent dominance of the person touching over the person being touched. Whitcher and Fisher conducted a study to see whether <b>therapeutic</b> <b>touch</b> to reduce anxiety differed between the sexes. A nurse was told to touch patients for one minute while the patients looked at a pamphlet during a routine preoperative procedure. Females reacted positively to the touch, whereas males did not. It was surmised that males equated the touch to being treated as inferior or dependent.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapy is an interpersonal, {{relational}} intervention used {{by trained}} psychotherapists to aid s in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual {{sense of well-being}} and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change and {{that are designed to}} improve the mental health of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a family). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation, though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, art, drama, narrative story, or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>touch.</b> Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.|$|E

40|$|In {{clinical}} holistic practice, it {{is recommended}} that ample time is spent with the gynecological or pelvic examination, especially in cases of women with suspected old emotional traumas following early childhood cases of incest or sexual abuse. The holistic principles of holding and processing should be followed with the purpose of healing the patient, re-establishing the natural relationship with the body, sexuality, and reproductive organs. Sexual violations are often forcibly repressed. It appears that the tissues that were touched during the violation often bear the trauma. It is characteristic of these patients that their love lives are often problematic and do not provide the necessary support to heal the old wounds in the soul and therapy is therefore indicated. When this is concerned with the reproductive organs, it poses particular difficulties, as the therapy can easily be experienced as a repetition of the original violation, not least due to the risk of projection and transference. There is, therefore, a need for a procedure that is familiar to and safe for the patient, for all work that involves <b>therapeutic</b> <b>touching</b> of sexual organs over and beyond what is standard medical practice. This paper presents one case story of earlier child sexual abuse and one case of temporary infertility. We have established a procedure of slow or extended pelvic examination, where time is spent to make the patient familiar with the examination and accept the whole procedure, before the treatment is initiated. The procedure is carried out with a nurse, and 3 h are set aside. It includes conversation on the present condition and symptoms; concept of boundaries; about how earlier assaults can be projected into the present; establishment of the therapeutic room as a safe place; exercises on when to say stop; therapeutic touch; visualization of the pelvic examination step by step beforehand; touching {{on the outside of the}} clothes with repetition of the stop procedure if necessary; pelvic examination paying special attention to traumatized (damaged/scarred/blocked) areas with feel, acknowledge, and let go of the traumatized areas; postprocessing of emotions and traumas with final healing. The patient cannot be healed until negative decisions are found and dropped with a tour back to the present, to let go of negative sentences and ideas, and a plan for further positive progress...|$|R
40|$|Research {{demonstrates}} that highly self-critical individuals can respond negatively {{to the initial}} introduction {{of a range of}} <b>therapeutic</b> interventions. Yet <b>touch</b> as a form of therapeutic intervention in self-critical individuals has received limited prior investigation, despite documentation of its beneficial effects for well-being. Using the Forms of Self-Criticism/Self-Reassuring Scale, 15 high- and 14 low- self-critical individuals (from a sample of 139 females) were recruited to assess how self-criticism impacts upon a single instance of focused touch. All participants took part in a hand massage- and haptic control- intervention. Salivary cortisol and alpha amylase, as well as questionnaire measures of emotional responding were taken before and after the interventions. Following hand massage, analyses revealed cortisol decreased significantly across all participants; and that significant changes in emotional responding reflected well-being improvements across all participants. Supplementary analyses further revealed decreased alpha amylase responding to hand massage as compared to a compassion-focused intervention in the same (highly self-critical) individuals. Taken together, the physiological and emotional data indicate high self-critical individuals responded in a comparable manner to low self-critical individuals to a single instance of hand massage. This highlights that focused touch may be beneficial when first engaging highly self-critical individuals with specific interventions...|$|R

Twenty-one practitioners of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>touch</b> participated in her study, and they attempted to detect her aura.

The practitioners then were to indicate if they could sense her biofield, and where her hand was.
