5|$|Dwight Howard {{has become}} a seven-time All-Star and All-NBA selection, and a three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. He also had the {{distinction}} as the only NBA player straight {{out of high school}} <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> 82 games as a rookie. There are also four other players that would be named All-Stars {{at some point in their}} careers, and Al Jefferson would be named to an All-NBA team. The draft is also notable for many high schoolers being drafted within a few picks from each other.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{his junior}} season, Moore participated in {{workouts}} in Houston with Houston Rocket and former Villanova Wildcat Kyle Lowry. The workouts focused on three point shooting, and Moore improved his percentages from 12.5percent {{as a sophomore}} to 38.3percent as a junior. His averages increased as well, to 15.2points per game, a team high, and 4.2rebounds per game, while also being the only Temple player <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> 34games. On December9,2010, Moore scored a season-high 30 points in a 68–65 upset of Georgetown. He shot 12-for-18 in the game, which was coach Fran Dunphy's 400th career victory. During the season, Moore scored in double-digits in 15straight games.|$|E

During his career, Crozier {{was named to the}} NHL First All-Star Team once, was a Calder Memorial Trophy winner, and was the first player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy while playing for the losing team in the Stanley Cup Finals. Also, Crozier is the last goaltender in the NHL <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> of his team's games during the regular season, doing so in 1964–65.|$|E

5|$|In {{his sophomore}} season (2012–13), he {{averaged}} 11.4 points in just under 30 minutes a game. This {{proved to be}} his breakout season and he would go on <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> 34 games that year. He helped Villanova defeat a few top five teams that season. In a comeback win over #5 Louisville on January 22, he made a 3-point play after making a steal at halfcourt which helped spark the rally. In a 75–71 overtime victory over #3 Syracuse on January 26, 2013, he had 25 points and six assists in 38 minutes. As {{a result of his}} play against Syracuse, Hilliard was honored as Big East Player of the Week and Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week.

25|$|Respecting one's {{health and}} {{physical}} well-being {{was one of the}} foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> over again.|$|E

Goalkeeper Scott Loach started every league match, while Danny Graham also played some part in every Watford fixture. Graham also finished as the club's top scorer with 14 goals, all of them coming in the Football League. Tied for second place were Heiðar Helguson and Tom Cleverley, both of whom scored 11 goals. Three Watford players were sent off in 2009–10: Cleverley, Jon Harley and Nathan Ellington received one red card each.|$|E

25|$|Several {{cars were}} {{conceived}} by Henry Ford from {{the founding of}} the company in 1903 before the Model T was introduced. Although he started with the Model A, there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes. The production model immediately before the Model T was the Model S, an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> over again with the letter A.|$|E
25|$|The Civil War hit {{the county}} {{education}} establishment hard. Several {{years in the}} 1860s saw no schools operating {{at all in the}} county and the county basically had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> over in building up the system after the war. The system went from 71 districts in which 61 districts taught school for a whole three months in 1860, to only four schools total for White students in 1870. Many of the former school buildings were in serious states of disrepair. But the end of Reconstruction brought renewed interest {{and by the end of}} the 1870s, 106 White schools and 6 Black schools existed. In 1885, the superintendent became an elected position, the first being Quincy F. Neal.|$|E
25|$|Ruskin {{was born}} at 54 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London (demolished 1969), south of St Pancras railway station. His {{childhood}} was characterised by the contrasting influences {{of his father and}} mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's Romanticism. They shared a passion for the works of Byron, Shakespeare and especially Walter Scott. They visited Scott's home, Abbotsford in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance. Margaret Ruskin, an Evangelical Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the King James Bible from beginning to end, and then <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.|$|E

25|$|Harbaugh {{passed for}} a career-high 3,121 yards with Chicago in 1991 {{and became the}} first Chicago quarterback since Vince Evans <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> 16 regular season games. He {{completed}} 275 of 478 passes for 15 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, was sacked 24 times (including a franchise-record 9 times on Oct 25 against Minnesota) for a loss of 163 yards, and rushed 338 yards on 70 carries. Chicago finished the season 11–5 like the year before, but in second place in the NFC Central. On December 29, 1991, he made his postseason debut in the , a 17–13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The Dallas defense overwhelmed him throughout the game, sacking him three times; and in the final drive of the game that started from Chicago's 4-yard line with 1:50 left, he threw an interception to Bill Bates on the fourth play from scrimmage. , however, his franchise records for completions (22), attempts (44) and yards per game in the 1991 postseason (218) still stood.|$|E
25|$|The Bengals {{took over}} {{the game in the}} second half, forcing Buffalo <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> of their drives from inside their own 23-yard line as they held the ball for only 9:04, totaling 53 yards, two first downs, and no points. On their first three drives of the second half, the Bills totaled −12 yards. Midway through the third quarter, Cincinnati punter Lee Johnson pinned the Bills at their own 1-yard line with a 58-yard kick. Buffalo then went three-and-out, and Bengals {{receiver}} Ira Hillary returned John Kidd's 50-yard punt 15 yards to the Bills 40. Three plays into their ensuing drive, Cincinnati faced fourth down and 4. Wilson ran six yards for a first down on a fake punt, enabling the Bengals to keep driving for a clutch score. Later in the drive, Bills defensive back Derrick Burroughs was ejected from the game for striking receiver Tim McGee in the head, turning what would have been a third and goal from the 8 into a first and goal from the 4-yard line, and Cincinnati ended up scoring with Woods' 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter, increasing their lead to 21–10. The Bills later managed a drive to the Bengals 18-yard line, but safety David Fulcher picked off a desperate fourth down pass from Kelly in the end zone.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his high}} school successes, Howard chose to forego college and {{declared}} for the 2004 NBA draft—a decision partly inspired by his idol Kevin Garnett who {{had done the same}} in 1995—where the Orlando Magic selected him first overall over UConn junior Emeka Okafor. He took the number 12 for his jersey, in part because it was the reverse of Garnett's 21 when he played for Minnesota. Howard joined a depleted Magic squad that had finished with only 21 victories the previous season; further, the club had just lost perennial NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady. Howard, however, made an immediate impact. He finished his rookie season with an average of 12.0 ppg and 10.0 rpg, setting several NBA records in the process. He became the youngest player in NBA history to average a double double in the regular season. He also became the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 10 rebounds in a season and youngest NBA player ever to record at least 20 rebounds in a game. Howard's importance to the Magic was highlighted when he became the first player in NBA history directly out of high school <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> 82 games during his rookie season. For his efforts, he was selected to play in the 2005 NBA Rookie Challenge, and was unanimously selected to the All-Rookie Team. He also finished third to fellow center Emeka Okafor of the Charlotte Bobcats and guard Ben Gordon of the Chicago Bulls for the Rookie of the Year award.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, L.A.P.D. {{recorded}} {{their second}} album, Who's Laughing Now. Released on May 3, 1991, {{it was their}} first full-length studio album, and consisted of eleven tracks. After they recorded the album, the group's lead vocalist, Pete Capra, left L.A.P.D. {{and was replaced by}} someone affectionately known by other band members as Corey. Bassist Arvizu wrote: [...] "Pete [...] was always doing amphetamines and stuff. He pretty much left just because of his drug abuse. So Munky , David , and I had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> over again." [...] The band later fired Corey after his behavior during an audition with producer Ross Robinson. While looking for a new singer, they heard Jonathan Davis singing for the alternative metal band Sexart. After the show, the remaining band members of L.A.P.D. asked him to join their band. Shortly after this, the band changed their name to Korn and added Brian Welch to the member line-up.|$|E

Residents were told to clear their yards of any debris or lose furniture that could become airborne during the storm, place shutters over windows and doors and assist elderly neighbors with shuttering their homes, and mariners should find a safe haven. A curfew from 10:00p.m. on October15 to 10:00a.m. on October16 was put in place. Due to the possibility of flash flooding, residents were to unclog and free up all waterways around their homes. Officials also warned people to stay away from areas prone to landslides until the [...] "all-clear" [...] was given. Owners of livestock were advised to have insured that they were secured in holding areas. As a precaution, the water supply would be shut down from 8:00p.m. October15 to 8:00a.m. October16. Four public areas, St. Peters Community Center, Dutch Quarter Community Center, Genevieve de Weever School, and the Salvation Army building would be used as emergency shelters.|$|E

500|$|During the 2006 Chicago Bears season, Grossman {{became the}} first Bears quarterback <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> sixteen games since Erik Kramer in 1995. [...] In a season dubbed as a [...] "roller coaster ride" [...] by Grossman himself, the fourth-year quarterback had several {{productive}} performances, which were seemingly diluted {{by a handful of}} turnover-ridden games, especially in Week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals, where Grossman fumbled twice and threw four interceptions. While earning a passer rating of at least 100 in seven games, he earned a sub 50 rating in five games during the latter portion of the season. Grossman, who was named as the NFC Offensive Player of the Month in September, concluded the season's final month with a 64.4 passer rating, including a zero rating during the season’s finale game against the Packers. [...] Grossman's work ethic drew criticism, when he admitted that he was not adequately prepared to play, and later claimed the game to be [...] "meaningless." [...] After noticing that his words had been misinterpreted, he rationalized his statement days later. His inconsistent performance drew criticism, and calls for Smith to bench Grossman in favor of the veteran Brian Griese.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> over on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He {{knew he had to}} release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I knew I had to make my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E
500|$|Durant {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} club's {{starting}} quarterback, but head coach Ken Miller gave backup Jyles significant playing time as well. Durant {{made the most of}} his opportunity, becoming the first Roughrider quarterback <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> 18 games since Kent Austin, who last played for the club in 1993. Durant's consistency on the field {{was one of the reasons}} he earned the Roughriders' starting quarterback position, along with his ability to run for yards when his pass protection breaks down. Durant was named the Roughriders nominee for CFL Most Outstanding Player, and was selected a West Division All-Star at quarterback. He was also named the Roughriders' Wireless Age Most Popular Player. Durant led the Roughriders to the Grey Cup, where they were defeated by the Montreal Alouettes on a last second field goal. He finished the 2009 season with 4,348 passing yards and 501 rushing yards. Durant threw 24 touchdown passes during the season and also had 21 interceptions, leading the CFL. Heading into the 2010 season, Durant wanted to cut down on his interceptions, although he tried to be optimistic, [...] "I throw 21 picks last year and I guarantee every guy with better stats than me wishes they were in the Grey Cup." ...|$|E
