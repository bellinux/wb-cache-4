5|$|As King of the Isles, Lǫgmaðr faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} factions supporting his younger brothers, Haraldr and Óláfr. At some point, the Islesmen {{are reported to}} have petitioned Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> temporary ruler in the region. This act may have been initiated {{on behalf of a}} faction supporting Óláfr. Whatever the case, Ua Briain responded by placing an Uí Briain relative upon the throne. The Uí Briain interlopers, however, do not appear to have been well received; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen, perhaps led by supporters of Lǫgmaðr himself.|$|E
5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E

He chose Raymond of Poitiers, the younger son of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine. He did not announce his decision in public {{because he wanted to}} prevent Alice and RogerII of Sicily from intervening.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making {{the producers of}} radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E

It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch.

He was replaced by Lord Simon, who took up his position on 12 May 1940.

Schuster also had influence in committee appointments; when Simon was asked <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> chairman for the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities he delegated to Schuster, who chose Sir Walter Monckton.|$|E

5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The Residence Act {{authorized}} the president <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>a</b> specific site along the Potomac for the permanent seat of government.

Washington announced his selection of a site on January 24, 1791, and planning for the new city began afterward. Washington personally oversaw this effort {{through the end of}} his presidency. In September 1791, the commissioners named the nascent city Washington, in the president's honor, and the district Columbia, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.|$|E
