5|$|Chadwick {{also found}} time to {{contribute}} to the administration of the wider university, serving on the Hebdomadal Council, as a Delegate of Oxford University Press, as one of the curators of the Bodleian, and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor 1974–5. It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981). The second of these in particular allowing him to draw on the full range of his interests.|$|E

50|$|The {{force is}} exerted {{by the air}} as a <b>pressure</b> {{difference}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfoil's surfaces. <b>Pressure</b> in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense, so that pressure must always {{be thought of as}} pushing, and never as pulling. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces. The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing's upper surface and increasing <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface pushes up harder than <b>the</b> reduced <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.|$|R
50|$|From Bernoulli's principle, <b>the</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{upper surface}} where the flow is moving faster {{is lower than}} <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface where it is moving slower. This pressure difference creates a net aerodynamic force, pointing upward.|$|R

The Egyptian government had competing interests he was attempting to balance. Mubarak wanted to maintain Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, the 1978 Camp David Accords, but also keep good relations with its fellow Arab states in the Middle East. The Israeli bombing of the PLO's Tunis headquarters the previous week had left many innocent Tunisians killed or wounded, adding to <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> Mubarak. He also wanted to maintain {{good relations with the}} USA to not jeopardize billions of dollars in foreign aid.|$|E
25|$|Under CBS {{president}} James T. Aubrey, Jr. <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> CBS News operations arose and escalated. Aubrey constantly {{fought with}} Friendly. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs {{and in his}} memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey spoke at length of how much money the news was costing the company, being a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. CBS founder and board chairman William S. Paley supported the news, however, and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. In 1962, Aubrey ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move. To Friendly's relief, in 1965 Aubrey was fired.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{have also}} arisen {{over the use}} of {{pangolin}} scales, turtle plastron, seahorses, and the gill plates of mobula and manta rays. Poachers hunt restricted or endangered species animals to supply the black market with TCM products. There is no scientific evidence of efficacy for tiger medicines. Concern over China considering to legalize the trade in tiger parts prompted the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to endorse a decision opposing the resurgence of trade in tigers. Fewer than 30,000 saiga antelopes remain, which are exported to China for use in traditional fever therapies. Organized gangs illegally export the horn of the antelopes to China. <b>The</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) used in traditional medicine is enormous; tens of millions of animals are unsustainably caught annually. Many species of syngnathid are currently part of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or national equivalents.|$|E
500|$|While {{making the}} album, Yellowcard had also {{developed}} a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character is featured in the songs [...] "Rough Landing, Holly" [...] and [...] "Holly Wood Died". The band explained the meaning of the title track, which they said is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged after the release of Ocean Avenue. Key also commented that when he was preoccupied with making the album, there were distractions while in the process; he simply referred to the distractions as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album just that. He also says that the main reason behind that was how it affected the band during that particular time.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> his time, Heber set out again on 30 January 1826, this time heading south for Madras (now Chennai), Pondicherry, Tanjore (Thanjavur) and {{ultimately}} Travancore. One {{reason for the}} tour {{was to examine the}} issue of caste, which persisted in the church in South India. In Tanjore on Easter Day, 26 March 1826, Heber preached to more than 1300, and on the following day conducted a confirmation service for a large Tamil congregation. On 1 April he moved on to Trichinopoly (Tiruchirappalli) where, next day, he confirmed 42 people. On 3 April, after attending an early-morning service at which he gave a blessing in the Tamil language, Heber returned to his bungalow for a cold bath. Immediately after plunging into the water he died, possibly from the shock of the cold water in the intense heat. Watson records that a contemporary engraving shows his body [...] "being carried from the bath by his servant and chaplain, the latter immaculately attired in a frock coat and top hat". His funeral was held the next day at St John's church, where he had preached his final sermon; he was buried within the church, {{on the north side of}} the altar.|$|E

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E
