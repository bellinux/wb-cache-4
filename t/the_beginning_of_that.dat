5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken as <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays {{as though they were}} real people.

5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E

Jennings topped Olmstead's Millionaire winnings with his 65th consecutive win, finishing the day with $45,099 and a new cumulative total of $2,197,000.|$|E

25|$|Fort Pitt was a fort {{in what is}} now {{the city}} of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.

The Braddock expedition, a 1755 attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with a bloody repulse at the Monongahela River.

In 1456, Thomas sent a letter to Pope Callixtus III asking him to find a bride for his son Stephen, hoping that the Holy See would provide him with a daughter-in-law of royal blood. Preparations were under way for another Ottoman attack on Hungary in <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror issued unusual demands to the King of Bosnia and his nobles, the Kosačas and the Pavlović family. Thomas was requested to send 10.000 loads of food, his father-in-law 8.000 and Petar Pavlović 4.000. Mehmed also demanded that they commit their troops and personally take part in the war on Ottoman side. From Thomas he further requested cession of four towns: two in the middle of Bosnia and two bordering Hungary and Venetian Dalmatia. All this was refused.|$|E

500|$|In 1888 the musicologist Hugo Riemann {{recommended}} Busoni to Martin Wegelius, {{director of}} the Institute of Music at Helsingfors (now Helsinki, Finland, then part of the Russian Empire), for the vacant position of advanced piano instructor. This was Busoni's first permanent post. Amongst his close colleagues and associates there were the conductor and composer Armas Järnefelt, the writer Adolf Paul, and the composer Jean Sibelius, with whom he struck up a continuing friendship. Paul described Busoni at this time as [...] "a small, slender Italian with chestnut beard, grey eyes, young and gay, with... a small round cap perched proudly on his thick artist's curls". Between 1888 and 1890 Busoni gave about thirty piano recitals and chamber concerts in Helsingfors; amongst his compositions at this period were a set of Finnish folksongs for piano duet Op. 27. In 1889, visiting Leipzig, he heard a performance on the organ of JS Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV 565), and was persuaded by his pupil Kathi Petri (the mother of his future pupil Egon Petri, then only 5 years old), to transcribe it for piano. Busoni's biographer Edward Dent writes that [...] "This {{was not only the}} beginning of [...] transcriptions, but... <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> style of pianoforte touch and technique which was entirely [...] creation." [...] Returning to Helsingfors, in March of the same year Busoni met his future wife, Gerda Sjöstrand, the daughter of the Swedish sculptor Carl Eneas Sjöstrand, and proposed to her within a week. For her he composed Kultaselle (Finnish: To the beloved) for cello and piano (published 1891 without opus number, BV 237).|$|E
500|$|After Napoleon's defeat, the Congress of Vienna {{established}} a new European political-diplomatic {{system based on}} the balance of power. This system reorganized Europe into spheres of influence, which, in some cases, suppressed the aspirations of the various nationalities, including the Germans and Italians. Generally, an enlarged Prussia and the 38 other states consolidated from the mediatized territories of 1803 were confederated within the Austrian Empire's sphere of influence. The Congress {{established a}} loose German Confederation (1815–1866), headed by Austria, with a [...] "Federal Diet" [...] (called the Bundestag or Bundesversammlung, an assembly of appointed leaders) that met {{in the city of}} Frankfurt am Main. In recognition of the imperial position traditionally held by the Habsburgs, the emperors of Austria became the titular presidents of this parliament. Problematically, the built-in Austrian dominance failed to take into account Prussia's 18th century emergence in Imperial politics. Ever since the Prince-Elector of Brandenburg had made himself King in Prussia at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> century, their domains had steadily increased through war and inheritance. Prussia's consolidated strength had become especially apparent during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War under Frederick the Great. As Maria Theresa and Joseph tried to restore Habsburg hegemony in the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick countered with the creation of the Fürstenbund (Union of Princes) in 1785. Austrian-Prussian dualism lay firmly rooted in old Imperial politics. Those balance of power manoeuvers were epitomized by the War of the Bavarian Succession, or [...] "Potato War" [...] among common folk. Even {{after the end of the}} Holy Roman Empire, this competition influenced the growth and development of nationalist movements in the 19th century.|$|E
