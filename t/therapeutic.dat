5|$|At <b>therapeutic</b> doses, {{amphetamine}} causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at <b>therapeutic</b> doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at <b>therapeutic</b> doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed <b>therapeutic</b> doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

5|$|Mercury in {{the form}} of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various {{traditional}} medicines, especially in traditional Chinese medicine. Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose, or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at <b>therapeutic</b> doses, though effects from <b>therapeutic</b> doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified, as the <b>therapeutic</b> basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. <b>Therapeutic</b> riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and <b>therapeutic</b> horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas <b>therapeutic</b> horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E

5|$|The {{side effects}} of {{amphetamine}} are varied, {{and the amount of}} amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term <b>therapeutic</b> use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for <b>therapeutic</b> reasons.|$|E

5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to <b>therapeutic</b> effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD <b>therapeutic</b> effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to <b>therapeutic</b> effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

5|$|Amphetamine {{has also}} been shown to produce a {{conditioned}} place preference in humans taking <b>therapeutic</b> doses, meaning that individuals acquire a preference for spending time in places where they have previously used amphetamine.|$|E

25|$|Two {{commonly}} discussed {{types of}} theoretical human cloning are <b>therapeutic</b> cloning and reproductive cloning. <b>Therapeutic</b> cloning would involve cloning cells {{from a human}} for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of 2014. Two common methods of <b>therapeutic</b> cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the <b>therapeutic</b> {{market for}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies has grown exponentially.

In 2007, eight of the 20 best-selling biotechnology drugs in the U.S. are <b>therapeutic</b> monoclonal antibodies. This rapid growth in demand for monoclonal antibody production has been well accommodated by the industrialization of mAb manufacturing.|$|E

25|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{is formed}} by the brain {{capillary}} endothelium and excludes from the brain ∼100% of large-molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98% of all small-molecule drugs. Overcoming the difficulty of delivering <b>therapeutic</b> agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders. In its neuroprotective role, the blood–brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and <b>therapeutic</b> agents to the brain. <b>Therapeutic</b> molecules and antibodies {{that might otherwise be}} effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts.|$|E

25|$|The work {{performed}} by clinical psychologists {{tends to be}} influenced by various <b>therapeutic</b> approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various <b>therapeutic</b> approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong <b>therapeutic</b> alliance. Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic <b>therapeutic</b> orientation.|$|E

25|$|Group {{psychotherapy}} is a {{key component}} of milieu therapy in a <b>therapeutic</b> community. The total environment or milieu is regarded as the medium of therapy, all interactions and activities regarded as potentially <b>therapeutic</b> and are subject to exploration and interpretation, and are explored in daily or weekly community meetings. However, interactions between the culture of group psychotherapeutic settings and the more managerial norms of external authorities may create 'organizational turbulence' which can critically undermine a group's ability to maintain a safe yet challenging 'formative space'. Academics at the University of Oxford studied the inter-organizational dynamics of a national democratic <b>therapeutic</b> community over a period of four years; they found external steering by authorities eroded the community's <b>therapeutic</b> model, produced a crisis, and led to an intractable conflict which resulted in the community's closure.|$|E
