60|$|Tom Sawyer was stumped; he see Jim had got {{him where}} he couldn't budge. He tried to wiggle out by saying they had FORGOT to put on that tax, but they'd be sure <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> it, next session of Congress, and then they'd put it on, {{but that was a}} poor lame come-off, and he knowed it. He said there warn't nothing foreign that warn't taxed but just that one, and so they couldn't be {{consistent}} without taxing it, and to be consistent was the first law of politics. So he stuck to it that they'd left it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix it before they got caught and laughed at.|$|E

"In one minute,' he says, {{and went}} on calmly stowing the things away, and when he finished, {{he looks at me}} quite serious, and says, 'I'm obliged to you,' he says, 'and I hope you haven't ketched cold {{standing}} with your feet on them bricks and nothing much on you,' he says. 'But I want most particular to arst you not to forget <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> that bird I giv' you,' he says.

It's a different sort, and you'll come to know its value bime-by, and that it ain't the kind of bird you can buy with a bit of bread and a pinch of tea,' he says. 'And there's something else you've got to think of--that wife of yours. I've been sort of married myself and can feel for you,' he says. 'The time will come when that there bird's pretty little ways will amuse her, and last of all it'll make her smile, and you'll get the benefit of that,' he says. 'And you'll remember the bird was giv' to you by a man named Jones--that's my name, Jones--walking from Newcastle to Dorchester, looking for work. A poor man, you'll say, down on his luck, but not one of the common sort, not a greedy, selfish man, but a man that's always trying to do something to make others happy,' he says.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR MADAM,--I do {{not know}} how it is in the White House, but in this house of ours {{whenever}} the minor half of the administration tries to run itself without the help of the major half it gets aground. Last night when I was offered the opportunity to assist you in the throwing open the Warner brothers superb benefaction in Bridgeport to those fortunate women, I naturally appreciated the honor done me, and promptly seized my chance. I had an engagement, but the circumstances washed it out of my mind. If I had only laid the matter before the major half of the administration on the spot, {{there would have been no}} blunder; but I never thought of that. So when I did lay it before her, later, I realized once more that it will not do for the literary fraction of a combination to try to manage affairs which properly belong in the office of the business bulk of it. I suppose the President often acts just like that: goes and makes an impossible promise, and you never find it out until it is next to impossible to break it up and set things straight again. Well, that is just our way, exactly-one half of the administration always busy getting the family into trouble, and the other half busy getting it out again. And so we do seem to be all pretty much alike, after all. The fact is, I had forgotten that we were to have a dinner party on that Bridgeport date--I thought it was the next day: which is a good deal of an improvement for me, because I am more used to being behind a day or two than ahead. But that is just the difference between one end of this kind of an administration and the other end of it, as you have noticed, yourself--the other end does not forget these things. Just so with a funeral; if it is the man's funeral, he is most always there, of course--but that is no credit to him, he wouldn't be there if you depended on him <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> it; whereas, if on the other hand--but I seem to have got off from my line of argument somehow; never mind about the funeral. Of course I am not meaning to say anything against funerals--that is, as occasions--mere occasions--for as diversions I don't think they amount to much But as I was saying--if you are not busy I will look back and see what it was I was saying.|$|E

50|$|The main issues <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> {{labels on}} {{cosmetic}} containers {{is that they}} provide safety guidance, including instructions for use and proper disposal. In the United States, companies must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Although the FDA does exercise authority over the cosmetic industry, it does not allocate sufficient resources to constantly monitor the industry. ISO defines an ingredient as a material that makes up the final product and not necessarily raw materials used {{in the production of}} the product. While the FDA does not have strict requirements for ingredients, they must still be listed on the primary container or secondary package.|$|E
50|$|Ambler's {{best known}} works are {{probably}} The Mask of Dimitrios (1939) (published in the US {{under the title}} A Coffin for Dimitrios), which {{was made into a}} film in 1944, and The Light of Day (1962), filmed in 1964 as Topkapi. He was also a successful screenwriter and lived in Los Angeles in his later years. Amongst other classic movies based on his work are Journey into Fear (1943), starring Joseph Cotten, and an original screenplay, The October Man (1947). He wrote the screenplay for A Night <b>to</b> <b>Remember</b> <b>about</b> the sinking of the Titanic, along with many other screenplays, particularly those concerning stories and adventures at sea. He published his autobiography in 1985, Here Lies Eric Ambler.|$|E
50|$|One final thing <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> all {{emotions}} {{that can be}} created through the identity control theory is the degree of closeness those evaluating the identity are to the individual. If the people around the individual {{are very close to}} the individual and they assure their identity, the individual will most likely experience extreme positive emotions. However, if they criticize the identity, the individual will experience extreme negative emotions. The opposite of this, meaning that those evaluating the identity are not extremely close to the individual, the individual's emotions will not become very extreme at all. This is because the opinions of the people close to an individual hold more weight in the individual's mind than the opinions of the people they are not close to.|$|E
