5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E
5|$|Members of the WSPU were {{sometimes}} heckled and derided for spoiling elections for Liberal candidates. On 18 January 1908, Pankhurst and her associate Nellie Martel {{were attacked by}} an all-male crowd of Liberal supporters who blamed the WSPU for costing them a recent by-election to the Conservative candidate. The men threw clay, rotten eggs, and stones packed in snow; the women were beaten and Pankhurst's ankle was severely bruised. Similar tensions later formed with Labour. Until party leaders made the vote for women a priority, however, the WSPU vowed to continue its militant activism. Pankhurst {{and others in the}} union saw party politics as distracting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> women's suffrage and criticised other organisations for putting party loyalty ahead of women's votes.|$|E

This analysis requires that the law being challenged must be rationally related to a legitimate government goal or purpose. Because state and local jurisdictions enjoy broad police powers, including protecting the public's safety and welfare, courts have not had trouble finding that BSL is rationally related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> protecting the public from allegedly dangerous breeds.|$|E
25|$|The name National Ignition Facility refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> igniting {{the fusion}} fuel, a long-sought {{threshold}} in fusion research. In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat {{produced by the}} fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually {{in order to keep}} the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against all losses of energy, so that fusion reactions can continue. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear burn. Ignition is considered a key requirement if fusion power is to ever become practical.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a {{study by}} Dietz, {{conducted}} at the University of Central Florida, found that of thirty-three games sampled, 41% did not feature female characters, 28% sexually objectified women, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized ("visions of beauty with large breasts and hips"), dependent ("victim or as the proverbial Damsel in Distress"), opponents ("evil or as obstacles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the game"), and trivial ("females depicted in fairly non-significant roles"). However, the study is criticized for not including {{a wide range of}} video games for study and for including old games published up to twenty years ago which do not represent current industry standards, for example, an increased presence of strong female characters.|$|E

500|$|Kelly pool (also {{known as}} pea pool, pill pool, keeley, the keilley game, and killy) is a pocket billiards game {{played on a}} {{standard}} pool table using fifteen numbered markers called peas or pills, and a standard set of sixteen pool balls. Gameplay involves players drawing peas at random from a , which assigns to them the correspondingly numbered pool ball, kept secret from their opponents, but which they must pocket {{in order to win}} the game. Kelly pool is a [...] game, which means that players must contact the lowest numbered [...] on each shot first until the opportunity to pocket their own is presented. Two rule variants are set forth under rules promulgated by the Billiard Congress of America (BCA). In the simpler form, the object of play starts and ends with the goal of pocketing one's secret ball. In the second, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> pocketing one's secret ball, points are scored in various ways. In the instance where pills are unavailable, a cloth may be used to cover the balls, which are then chosen blindly, recorded, and replaced for play.|$|E
500|$|Soma Bringer was {{the brainchild}} of Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the co-founders of {{developer}} Monolith Soft. It was the first time Monolith Soft had full development responsibilities for a game on a portable platform. The game took approximately two years to develop: Takahashi's aim was to create an in-depth introductory role-playing experience for the DS. The DS was chosen as the game's platform so people could both enjoy the game and play it for short bursts on the go. The story was written by Takahashi's wife Soraya Saga, whose previous work included Final Fantasy VI (1994), Xenogears (1998), and the Xenosaga series. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> creating a fun co-op gameplay experience, Saga deliberately kept the story [...] "simple and clear not to interrupt the fun of playing". [...] The narrative was based around the titular energy [...] "Soma", which was a key part of everyday life, with the Soma Ring encircling the planet forming {{a key part of the}} story. Also among the staff were director Shingo Kawabata, art director Tonny Waiman Koo, and character designer Tadahiro Usuda. Takahashi acted as game designer.|$|E
