40|$|The {{mechanical}} design {{of trees and}} wood is suited to face two types of mechanical loads: permanent loads related {{to the increase in}} self-weight, and <b>temporary</b> <b>loads</b> due to external actions such as wind. In angiosperms, a tensile longitudinal stress is always generated around the tree periphery during wood formation. This maturation stress {{plays a key role in}} terms of biomechanical adaptation of the tree to its environment: it provides the stem with a motor system allowing the postural control of the tree (i. e. compensating for the effect of permanent loads) and, eventually, the reorientation of stems and branches in response to disturbance. Another important function of this tensile pre-stress located at the periphery is to improve the bending resistance of stems against <b>temporary</b> <b>loads,</b> by compensating for the relatively low compressive strength of green wood. As consequence of maturation stress production, compressive growth stress accumulates in the core of the trunk. A numerical model was formulated and implemented to compute the field of longitudinal growth stress across a growing cross-section, and to calculate ecologically relevant parameters defined as the "performance of the motor system" and the "safety against temporary bending". The model is general enough to account for any cross-section shape, growth eccentricity, viscoelastic behavior of wood and heterogeneity of wood mechanical properties (stiffness and maturation stress). Simulations were performed to evaluate the influence of these parameters on the growth stress pattern, motor performance, and safety against temporary bending. Results show that in some situations, the growth stress pattern can have a negative impact on the bending safety. A sensitivity analysis was performed and evidences that, in some case, the motor performance can be only improved at the expense of a lower safety against bending loads. Conclusions emphasize the fact that the value of biomechanical parameters mediates a trade-off between the motor performance of the stem and its safety against <b>temporary</b> <b>loads,</b> and that the range of real value of biomechanical parameters is close to optimal regarding this trade-off...|$|R

The basic theories {{of the effect of}} load, material, and temperature on the conductor are also briefly discussed. The long time creep curve of a conductor appears as a straight line in log-log plot. The stable period of this curve after prestressing is directly affected by the prestress load and time. The conductor's initial strain is increased if the conductor is reeled or severely bent. The slope of the stress-strain curve of a conductor is only slightly affected by the long time creep. It is also slightly influenced by the initial condition of the conductor. However, the complete stress strain curve will move to the right of where it should be if the conductor is severely reeled or bent. Repeated <b>temporary</b> <b>load</b> (wind and ice) will increase the non-elastic elongation of a conductor.

40|$|Voltage {{stability}} improvement methods {{following a}} disturbance and Fault Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR) event are studied {{with the aim}} of satisfying a voltage recovery criterion and saving as much load as possible. These methods are <b>temporary</b> <b>load</b> interruption and the use of Static Var Compensators (SVCs). The loads are temporarily tripped and then reconnected. The locations and sizes of SVCs are also determined. The criterion to be met is the recovery of voltages at all buses in the network to 0. 9 pu within 1 s following a disturbance. Simulations are done on a typical distribution system with a large number of motor loads using Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) software with the help of Python programming language for automation and control and the results are analyzed. The results show that load interruption aids and significantly improves the voltage recovery following a disturbance in the network. It is also observed from the results that the use of SVCs also enables the voltage to recover faster with the criterion for voltage recovery at all buses fulfilled. However, the best results are obtained when load interruption is combined with the use of SVCs. The two methods complement each other. When the two methods are combined the amount of load that has to be interrupted is less and the number of SVCs required is also reduced. This results in fewer loads being interrupted. Moreover, the investment cost on SVCs is also reduced...|$|E
40|$|Load {{control is}} {{necessary}} to prevent a database system from data-contention or memory-contention thrashing, caused by excessive lock conflicts or excessive buffer replacements that may occur due to <b>temporary</b> <b>load</b> peaks. The load control method that is adopted by virtually all commercial database systems is to limit the degree of multi-programming (DMP), that is, {{the maximum number of}} transactions that are allowed to execute concurrently. Se-vere shortcomings of this DMP method are that it requires manual tuning by the human system administrator, and that it cannot react to dynamic changes of the transaction mix in the workload. In this paper we present a performance evaluation of an adaptive, that is, self-tuning load control method for the avoidance of data-contention thrashing. The basic princi-ple of this method is to monitor a data-contention per-formance metric called the conflict ratio, and to react to critical changes of the conflict ratio by temporarilysuspend-ing the admission of newly arriving transactions or by can-celling blocked transactions that block other transactions. In order to show the practical viability of our method, we have performed a performance evaluation based on page reference traces from the on-line transaction processing system of a large Swiss bank. The adaptive load control method copes well with the dynamic load fluctuations of this workload. It clearly outperforms the DMP method, since it adapts the system to the dynamic changes of the transaction mix whereas the DMP method uses a fixed DMP as a (bad) compromise for the entire duration of the experiment...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{magnesium}} for degradable implants can fill {{the need for}} <b>temporary,</b> <b>load</b> bearing, metallic orthopaedic implants without the risks and expense of further surgeries once the bone has healed. Mg is non toxic and biocompatible, but the corrosion rate in the body is too high. The rate {{will need to be}} moderated if these implants are to be made clinically useful. A review of common orthopaedic coatings found that the biomimetic calcium phosphate coating process meets the criteria for a good coating. This process was designed for permanent implants, and its corrosion protection properties were unknown on Mg. The research presented here evaluates and optimizes aspects of the corrosion protection of biomimetic coatings in vitro. To accurately identify the corrosion mechanisms of such coatings, the in vitro behaviour of several common simulated body fluids and buffer systems was evaluated. The deposition of biomimetic coatings on Mg was compared to Ti. The effect of common surface treatments on the deposition, composition, and ultimate corrosion protection was identified {{in order to understand the}} corrosion properties of these coatings. Following the results, the biomimetic method was modified to optimize the protection by reducing the defects. The corrosion properties of these modified coatings were assessed in vitro. The limitation of the biomimetic coatings was found to be in all cases sensitive to the defects present in the coating. While these could be minimized, they were not eliminated. This led to unfavourable corrosion properties. To solve this problem, a novel treatment was developed to give the biomimetic coatings self-healing properties. This treatment promoted local repair in the coating at the defects, greatly improving the corrosion properties. The in vitro model was increased in complexity by adding first amino acids, then proteins. The corrosion behaviour of the coatings was compared in these solutions to understand the effects of these molecules. The data gathered will help to build a better model of in vivo corrosion, and allow better prediction of the performance of biomimetic coatings for corrosion resistance...|$|E

30|$|The {{shape memory}} effect was first {{discovered}} by Chang and Read in 1932. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are polymers {{that have the}} ability to be deformed and fixed into a temporary shape; they are then able to recover to their original permanent shape only when they are exposed to a specific external stimulus such as heat, light, magnetic field, moisture or pH. Not all polymers can be fixed in a temporary shape. For example, rubber can change shape whenever it’s loaded, but when the load is removed the rubber goes back instantaneously to its original shape and no fixing of the <b>temporary</b> <b>loaded</b> shape has occurred. However, when the shape memory polymers are deformed when loaded, they {{have the ability to}} trap mechanical energy as internal energy and release this energy whenever an external stimulus causes a change in the molecular relaxation rate or in material morphology (Li 2014). Shape memory polymers not only have this shape-changing advantage but they are also cheap, lightweight, nontoxic, biocompatible and biodegradable (Ratna and Karger-Kocsis 2008).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{behaviour}} of reinforced concrete beams subjected to sustained and repeated load types in bending. Mid-span deflections and surface strain profiles were monitored over an 80 day period so that comparisons {{could be made}} between the structural response of RC (reinforced concrete) beams to the different load types tested. The load level at which beams under a sustained load were held represented the mean value of {{the upper and lower}} load of the repeated load types. The two different repeated load amplitudes investigated corresponded to 24 and 12 % with respect to the mean load. In addition, beams were subjected to two different loading frequencies throughout testing (0. 2 Hz and 1 Hz). Measured surface strains were considerably higher in both the tension and compression zones of beams subjected to repeated load types. This was thought to be primarily due to the effects of cyclic creep in the compression zone and a higher degree of cracking within the tension zone. The progressive long-term increase in deflection is shown to be a result of strain development primarily in the compression zone. In contrast, the strain increase at tensile reinforcement level after 10 days under load is limited, regardless of the applied load type. The repeated load types are shown to affect the section stiffness most significantly within the initial period of loading (0 - 10 days). Results also show that the beam’s response is sensitive to increases in both the loading frequency and load amplitude. This study aims to highlight the importance of considering not only the current loading conditions, but also the load history of a reinforced concrete section (particularly any <b>temporary</b> <b>load</b> peaks, which would lead to a permanent deterioration of section stiffness,) when attempting to determine the current state of an RC section. Using experimental results, the validity of Expressions 7. 19 and 7. 9 of Eurocode 2 (EC 2) are examined. The additional damage within the tension zone caused by the repeated load types is not accounted for in either expression, meaning that the tension stiffening effect is overestimated. Consequences of this are that design code SLS (serviceability limit state) checks for beams with complex load histories may be inaccurate, and that the average steel stress within the reinforced concrete sections may be underestimated...|$|E

Nevertheless, {{the application of}} the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) thrust jack forces is a crucial <b>temporary</b> <b>loading</b> condition during construction, which may govern the design procedure {{as well as the other}} stages. Tunnel segments were traditionally reinforced with conventional rebars in order to resist the tensile stresses at both Serviceability (SLS) and Ultimate Limit States (ULS). In the two last decades, Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) has been also used in several precast tunnel segments with or without conventional rebars. For structural purposes, steel fibers are generally used, even though some types of structural macro-synthetic fibers, which are able to impart significant toughness and ductility to concrete, have been recently introduced in the market. For these reasons, an experimental program aimed to investigate the local splitting behavior in the segment regions under the TBM hydraulic jacks was carried out at the University of Brescia. Tests on concrete prisms (with or without fibrous reinforcement) under Line Load (LL) or Point Load (PL) configurations were carried out in order to evaluate the beneficial effects of polypropylene (PP) fibers in controlling typical splitting cracks occurring under the jack loads, which represent one of the most severe loading conditions for tunnel segments. Experimental results show the feasibility of using polypropylene fibers in tunnel segments, since they significantly enhance both the splitting bearing capacity and the ductility. Fibers lead to a stable development of the splitting crack, which allows a redistribution of stresses after cracking. However, the effectiveness of fibers is influenced by the casting direction, which leads to a different fiber orientation. When the latter is favorable (fibers expected to be mainly transversal to the splitting crack) the bearing capacity is higher than in case of an unfavorable casting direction (fibers expected to be mainly parallel to the splitting crack) ...|$|R
