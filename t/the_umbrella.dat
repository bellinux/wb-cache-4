2500|$|Christo and Jeanne-Claude {{prepared}} {{for their next}} project, [...] "The Umbrellas." [...] The plan was to have yellow umbrellas set up in California and blue umbrellas in Japan at the same time. In December 1990, after much preparation, the first steel bases for <b>the</b> <b>umbrellas</b> were installed. At the bases 80cm long anchors were fastened to the ground to withstand tensions of 1,500 kgf (15 kN). In September 1991 <b>the</b> <b>umbrellas</b> were brought to their places by 2,000 workers. In California, some of the bases were transported to the site by helicopter. The final cost of the project totaled $26 US million, and it was completely financed by the artists themselves through sale of preparatory drawings etc. They do not take any form of sponsorship. By September 7, 1,340 blue umbrellas in Ibaraki and 1,760 yellow <b>umbrellas</b> at <b>the</b> Tejon Ranch in southern California had been set up; the exhibition opened on 9 October 1991. <b>The</b> <b>umbrellas</b> were positioned closely together in the limited space of Japan, whereas in California they were placed in all directions in its vast uncultivated land. In total, 3 million people saw <b>the</b> <b>umbrellas,</b> each measuring 6 meters in height and 8.66 meters in diameter. On October 27, they started the removal of this project and restored the land to earlier condition. <b>The</b> <b>umbrellas</b> were taken apart {{and most of the}} elements were recycled. <b>The</b> <b>umbrellas</b> became a huge tourist attraction, finding use as everything from picnic spots to wedding altars. On 26 October 1991, one of <b>the</b> <b>umbrellas</b> in California was toppled by high winds, killing one woman and injuring several others. The exhibit was ordered closed immediately. A second death occurred during the removal of <b>the</b> <b>umbrellas.</b>|$|R
