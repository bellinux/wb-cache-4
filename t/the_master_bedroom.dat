5|$|The house stood empty {{until the}} Manhattan Project support {{personnel}} arrived in early 1945. The northeast room (<b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom)</b> was designated the assembly room. Workbenches and tables were installed. To keep dust and sand out of instruments and tools, {{the windows were}} covered with plastic. Tape was used to fasten {{the edges of the}} plastic and to seal doors and cracks in the walls.|$|E
5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung in <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended at the door of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom.</b> She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|The First Lady {{secured the}} {{assistance}} of renowned interior designer Ted Graber, popular with affluent West Coast social figures, to redecorate the family living quarters. A Chinese-pattern, handpainted wallpaper was added to <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Family furniture {{was placed in the}} president's private study. The First Lady and her designer retrieved a number of White House antiques, which had been in storage, and placed them throughout the mansion. In addition, many of Reagan's own collectibles were put out for display, including around twenty-five Limoges Boxes, as well as some porcelain eggs and a collection of plates.|$|E
5000|$|This album {{seems to}} get its title from <b>The</b> <b>master's</b> <b>bedroom,</b> it's worth {{spending}} a night there, a 1920 painting by surrealist Max Ernst.

5|$|Sheila {{was found}} on the floor of <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{bedrooms}} {{and a small}} kitchenette upstairs. <b>The</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where Mr. and Mrs. Adamson slept, is on {{the southwest corner of}} the house. It has a large tiled bathroom, and Mrs. Adamson's clothes and hat collection remain in her closet. Next to <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> is the one designed for the Adamsons' son; its bathroom has detailed tiles depicting ships and nautical scenes. The girls' bedroom in the center facing the ocean has a tremendous view of the ocean and coast. These three bedrooms open onto a large upstairs patio with the home's most spectacular panoramic view of the ocean, the Malibu lagoon and the coast in both directions. The fourth bedroom upstairs is at the eastern end of the second floor and looks out of a large Dombeya tree that blooms with spectacular bright red flowers in the spring.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{living room}} ceiling was hand painted and stenciled by Bryan Albert Painting Studio LLC located in Wauwatosa, WI. An Arts & Crafts-style {{chandelier}} {{was added to}} the room when electricity was installed in 1912. The room's hardwood floor was installed diagonally which was expensive at the time. An original Eastlake-style fireplace was brought out of storage during the 1974 reconstruction and two original ceramic dogs were placed on top. Next to the living room is <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> which features a closet which were rare at the time since they were taxed as an additional room.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{his earlier}} town villas Corbusier {{was able to}} {{carefully}} design all four sides of the Villa Savoye {{in response to the}} view and the orientation of the sun. On the ground floor he placed the main entrance hall, ramp and stairs, garage, chauffeur and maid's rooms. At first floor <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> the son's bedroom, guest bedroom, kitchen, salon and external terraces. The salon was oriented to the south east whilst the terrace faced the east. The son's bedroom faced the north west and the kitchen and service terrace were on the south west. At second floor level were a series of sculpted spaces that formed a solarium.|$|E
25|$|Pierre and Eugénie Savoye {{approached}} Corbusier {{about building}} a country home in Poissy {{in the spring of}} 1928. The site was on a green field on an otherwise wooded plot of land with a magnificent landscape view to the north west that corresponded with the approach to the site along the road. Other than an initial brief prepared by Emile for a summer house, space for cars, an extra bedroom and a caretaker's lodge, Corbusier had such freedom with the job that he was only limited by his own architectural palette. He began work on the project in September 1928. His initial ideas were those that eventually manifested themselves in the final building but between Autumn 1928 and Spring 1929 he undertook a series of alternatives that were influenced primarily by the Savoye's concern about cost. The eventual solution to this problem was to reduce the volume of the building by moving <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> down to the first floor and reducing the grid spacing down from 5 metres to 4.75 metres.|$|E

Cyril Smith then placed the core in the uranium tamper plug, or [...] "slug." [...] Air gaps were filled with [...] gold foil, and the two halves of the plug were held together with uranium washers and screws which fit smoothly into the domed ends of the plug.

500|$|The {{original}} boundary of Virginia House property, {{recorded in the}} Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of the County of Henrico, Virginia, is described as lot 9, Block 41, Windsor Farms, in the plan of Windsor Farms made by Allen J. Saville, Inc., dated September 15, 1926. In 1928, Virginia Weddell requested that a two-story porch be added to expand <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> suite and to build a second-floor sunroom. This was constructed in January 1932 by the contracting firm of Claiborne and Taylor, and was designed again by Henry Morse using Briar Hill sandstone. Further developments {{were made in the}} 1930s. On May 29, 1935, a shipment of Cotswold Stone Roofing Slate arrived from England. Thicker, heavier and lighter in color than Virginia Buckingham Slate, the Cotswold slate was used to emphasize the height of the steep roof. On April 14, 1936, an adjacent [...] lot was purchased to accommodate an expansive landscape plan.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{story about}} a leper whom St. Elizabeth brought to <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> <b>Bedroom,</b> to keep him warm and comfortable. When the royal {{household}} learned about it, there was a commotion. Louis could not believe Elizabeth could do such thing, so he led the members of the household to see for themselves… to prove that there was no leper. There was a wounded Christ in the room.|$|R

500|$|Reagan {{became the}} First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as {{president}} in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated {{her desire to}} create a more suitable [...] "first home" [...] in the White House, as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect. White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having [...] "cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [...] beaten up floors"; rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations. In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the press briefing room. The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires. The closet in <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium.|$|E
500|$|Virginia House is a large, asymmetrical, two-story long {{rectangular}} stone {{building with}} massive sandstone walls, small medieval windows, characterized by two high Dutch gables that {{date to the}} 1620 remodeling of the Thomas Hawkins-era Priory in Warwickshire, England. [...] The adjacent cross-gable roofs and crenelated balustrade over the carriage entrance provide a horizontal cross-axis {{on either side of}} the gabled central bays. Two rear ells of the house project into the garden terrace, one of them containing the two-story cathedral-ceilinged library, and the other a drawing room and <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> wing. Polygonal bays and oriel windows project from the north and south sides with heavy perimeter walls constructed of recycled sandstone. Over a window on the west side of the north elevation of Virginia house is a copy of a coat of arms commemorating the visit of Queen Elizabeth I to the Priory in England in 1572. The original coat of arms is currently on display inside. The leaded-glass, quarrel-paned casement windows widely used in Virginia House also feature authentic crown glass dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century salvaged from the English priory. The interior of the property is richly embellished with oak furnishings.|$|E
500|$|The Art Deco-style interior, {{meant to}} evoke a 1920s Hollywood style, {{featured}} mahogany woodwork, tile floors and chandeliers. The inside also contained Spanish-style white stucco, spiral staircases and wrought iron features including stair rails, built-in cabinetry door and window hardware and lighting fixtures. The house included a basement pool (which eventually closed due to water leaks), a stone fireplace [...] in width, and small square windows. Also {{in the basement}} were the furnace, a storage room, and spaces for laundry and billiards. The main floor housed the garage, a kitchen and breakfast bay, the living and dining rooms and a music room. <b>The</b> <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> was adjacent to a deck above the dining and music rooms at {{the southwest corner of}} the property. Fireplaces and hallway floors featured brown ceramic tile; black glazed ceramic tile was used in the master bathroom, while black, red and yellow tiles were used in the breakfast bay. One of the castle's bathrooms was said to be modeled on Charlie Chaplin's. The interior was arranged around a central stair tower capped with a conical roof clad in copper. Chimneys vented the centrally located furnace and rose from fireplaces in the house's west hall.|$|E
5000|$|This album {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Mike Shoun, the drummer that joined the band following the departure of previous drummer, Patrick Mullins. Shoun's arrival marked {{a change in the}} band's sound. John Dwyer noted that his style [...] "brought it up to a more party thing". The change in style can be observed in Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion, which was recorded prior to the creation of <b>The</b> <b>Master's</b> <b>Bedroom</b> Is Worth Spending a Night In (both were released in 2008). The songs [...] "Block of Ice" [...] and [...] "Ghost In The Trees" [...] appear on both releases, but the latter performances on <b>The</b> <b>Master's</b> <b>Bedroom...</b> are faster and more rock-oriented. [...] "Two Drummers Disappear" [...] also features Chris Woodhouse as second drummer. Woodhouse was the mix engineer for the twelve of the songs on the album that were recorded in San Francisco. The remaining three tracks, [...] "Graveyard Drug Party", [...] "Maria Stacks", and [...] "You Will See This Dog Before You Die", were recorded in New York City with mix engineers Dave Sitek (of TV on the Radio) and Chris Moore. Jigmae Baer was the drummer for these three tracks, rather than Mike Shoun.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the band}} had {{previously}} released material through In The Red Records, John Dwyer decided to self-release the album instead, and said, [...] "I {{learned a lot}} from Larry In the Red founder, but I know what I want, and I like to control everything, decide who I'm working with." [...] The album was released through Castle Face Records, a record label he co-owns. The band has not self-released an album since <b>The</b> <b>Master's</b> <b>Bedroom</b> Is Worth Spending a Night In.|$|R
50|$|On April 16, 2013, The band {{released}} Floating Coffin. The {{album was}} released on Castle Face Records, a label that John Dwyer co-owns with Brian Lee Hughes and Matt Jones. The album was the first since <b>The</b> <b>Master's</b> <b>Bedroom...</b> to be self-released. Later that year, they released the Moon Sick EP, a collection of four songs from the Floating Coffin sessions that {{were excluded from the}} album. The EP was released as a benefit for Healthy San Francisco, a healthcare organization that had aided Dwyer and his friends over the years.|$|R
