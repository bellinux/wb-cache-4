5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> the warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it {{was connected to the}} Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Hayward credits Besson with {{showing the}} {{collaboration}} between the Burgundians and the English more accurately than previous filmmakers. Many lines during scenes of Joan's trial are taken verbatim from Joan's real trial transcript. Joan is shown receiving both wounds she was given in real life (an arrow above the breast and later an arrow to the leg), and the film includes some of the 15th-century accounts associated with Joan, such as being able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> Charles VII from {{among a group of}} his courtiers at Chinon. The examining of Joan's virginity was a real test Joan had to complete to prove her merit.|$|E

5000|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the meaning of a (referring) word is the rule or features that one must use in order <b>to</b> successfully <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> its referent. In that respect, (2) and (3) come closer to wearing their meanings on their sleeves, because they are explicitly stating a rule for <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> their referents: [...] "Find whoever was prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", or [...] "find whoever is Cherie's current husband". But that does not settle the matter, because there's still the problem of the meaning of the components of that rule ("UK," [...] "during", [...] "current", [...] "PM", [...] "Cherie", [...] "husband"), and how <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> them <b>out.</b>|$|R
5|$|Denning met {{his future}} wife Mary Harvey on 25 October 1914 aged fifteen at his confirmation; she was the {{daughter}} of the Vicar of Whitchurch. Denning attempted to court her for many years, but for a long time his love was unrequited, with Mary wanting them to be only friends. After a dance at Beaulieu on 18 January 1930 she finally admitted her love for him, and he returned to Hampshire with her <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> an engagement ring. Barely six months away from the set date for their wedding Mary was diagnosed with tuberculosis, but she recovered and the couple were married on 28 December 1932, with the wedding officiated by Cecil Henry Boutflower, Bishop of Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Eva {{finds herself}} growing fonder of Albert {{and they have}} lunch with his teenage {{daughter}}, Tess, who, like Eva's daughter Ellen, is {{graduating from high school}} and moving away to attend college. A few days later, Eva goes to her massage appointment with Marianne and realizes that Albert is Marianne's ex-husband after Marianne tells a story about how he manages <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> onions when scooping salsa — the same story Albert had told Eva, but about guacamole. Tess then arrives at the house and Eva's suspicions are confirmed. Marianne tries to introduce Eva to Tess, but Eva hides behind a tree to avoid the meeting. Eva continues seeing Albert, keeping her friendship with Marianne a secret; likewise, she does not tell Marianne that she is seeing him.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} exert more pressure, {{although}} all their play {{was in front}} of the Milan penalty area, while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. Milan had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> a pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball {{to the side of the}} Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2–0 to Milan. Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner. However, they were unable to find a second goal and the referee blew for full-time with the score 2–1 to Milan.|$|E
5000|$|... {{this was}} Halford's first book, and it {{launched}} the opening salvo {{in the decades}} long battle pitting fly fishers favoring the floating fly against those endorsing the sunk fly, an argument which today seems as appropriate as the house cook slipping on boxing gloves in preparation <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> fly droppings from the black pepper. Nine color plates of hand colored flies. One color chart. Text illustrations. Six 19th century American fly patterns laid in. 136 pp. including index.|$|R

5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fairly}} cagey first 21 minutes, {{the first major}} {{incident}} of the game occurred when Paul Scholes and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United {{spent the rest of}} the first half pressing for a second goal, and had two good opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.|$|E

25|$|While harvesting, it's also a {{good idea}} to try <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> as many eggs/cocoons as {{possible}} and return them to the bin. Eggs are small, lemon-shaped yellowish objects that can usually be seen pretty easily with the naked eye and picked out.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{interpreted}} the Gödel universe as a counterexample to Einstein's hopes that general relativity should exhibit {{some kind of}} Mach principle, citing {{the fact that the}} matter is rotating (world lines twisting about each other) in a manner sufficient <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> a preferred direction, although with no distinguished axis of rotation.|$|E
25|$|Sensitivity to {{the data}} {{distribution}} {{can be used to}} an advantage. For example, scaled correlation is designed to use the sensitivity to the range in order <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> correlations between fast components of time series. By reducing the range of values in a controlled manner, the correlations on long time scale are filtered out and only the correlations on short time scales are revealed.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} study, Saffran found that adults and older {{children}} (first and second grade children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language {{which had no}} cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present.

25|$|Mesopelagic {{fish are}} adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Most {{of them are}} visual predators with large eyes. Some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upwards. These give {{binocular}} vision and great sensitivity to small light signals. This adaptation gives improved terminal vision {{at the expense of}} lateral vision, and allows the predator <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> squid, cuttlefish, and smaller fish that are silhouetted against the gloom above them.|$|E
25|$|In {{a police}} photo lineup, an officer shows {{a group of}} photos to a witness or crime victim and asks him or her <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> the suspect. This is {{basically}} a single-blind test of the witness's memory, and {{may be subject to}} subtle or overt influence by the officer. There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a double-blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos to the witness does not know which photo is of the suspect.|$|E
