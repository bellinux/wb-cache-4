40|$|This bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the project of a guest house, which {{is located in the}} area of Žďárské Vrchy. The {{concerned}} building stays on its own in a gently sloped down terrain. The whole building is constructed in a barrier-free way and is primarily intended to be used for recreation as well as housing capacity including eating facilities. The aforementioned premises are build on a rectangular groundplan with architectonic features of a log farmer´s house with agricultural buildings inside of the inbuild yard. There is a restaurant in the ground floor, furthermore room for social activities, <b>terace,</b> hall, reception, kachen, store house, bathroom and premises for employees. Attic apartments are constructed in the way that allows different sizes of the rooms. This range varies from two bed up to four bed rooms with a maximum capacity of 18 people including private bathrooms; and also small flat for the keeper of the premises. The building is designed with a wall-bearing system based on fundamental isolating special shaped bricks wasted in boarding of a plinth of fundamentals TERMO, formed from a concrete of a type C 16 / 20. The vertical bearing-constructions are bricked from Porotherm 44 PROFI, Porotherm 36, 5 PROFI on a mortar and light construction of a type of wooden house. The ceiling construction is made of prestressed concrete floor slab Spiroll Goldbeck. Half-Hipped Roof is made of wooden roof truss and is covered with special roofing material EUREKO DDS II in the shade of black.

40|$|ARCHITECTURE The centre and {{entrance}} point for atrection a relx is <b>terace</b> with pool, with corridor to cafe and skylights {{that leads to}} reception. Around this atrium, there is a ramp, rising up. Pools are not see n ko the screens are individual attractions, atmosphere. The height change of each pool, sauna and whether this involves physical effort is rewarded with open views to the surroundings and relax themselves. Entering the building through a covered, but bright bay, passage {{is a continuation of}} the street fishing. Thus {{the very end of the}} reception side. Thus eliminate the problem of a parcel which is like a scene out of town. Layout In the passages suggest leaving the car park, Kafe-bar with a simple menu and fresh multifunctional workshop, creative playground. It is known fact, that in the old spa locations to find valuable pieces of pottery, small painting and sculpture and other artifacts that speak of links with the vivacious work, relax, relax with a manual and spiritual. This room will also serve as a nursery for parents resting in the spa, in the specified date and time. Upon entering the spa itself, the reception with high ceilings and skylights from the terrace, the visitor to the issue of changing rooms with bathroom facilities. Consequently, the choice whether to receive the attractions, or go down to the fitness center or gym. Another option is to move the spa itself. In the direction from the top down it is pliable dough, the blood will get the opposite route, in which the visitor shall issue a physical effort. 2 np In addition to coffee for guests only and exit to the terrace, and massage booths are located. Much of the area occupied by the technical room, spa bath as well as administration. On the next floor guest vystkytne a larger foyer, drinking KURO room and swimming and first aid. Glass facades can be glanced only in forests of the Riviera, but the atrium, with an outdoor terrace and heated swimming pool at all times. Foyer is the actual beginning of the journey. The first ramp is rising just from my father. All the dark hallway, followed by a bright and translucent glass facades. The key is just a wall bordering the ramps and a few additional columns for the perimeter of the building. About half a meter above (and always rises only about 500 mm, the gradient of 1 : 16 to 8 meters length), the visitor gets to the first pool. Sunny southern facade is designed as a double, at this point is the greenhouse, it is no wonder that the first two pools are linked to breathing, inhalation, nature herbs. The hall (+ 7400) is glass mat glass sanitary unit consisting of two toilets, toilets for disabled people and installation bay. On one front wall of the shower. This element is repeated, the cabin is only 2. 6 meters high (sv room is 3. 65 meters), it was acting to hinder lightweight and transparent. On the left side counterclockwise overcomes next ramp stages. Pools are right to counter a výrivý. In this part of the facade facing the street catchment area, the intersection of fishing and of 8 m of pools have already seen the two interface Brno: Petrov and Špilberk. There is also a visitor gets to escape-connecting staircase. Possibility of shortening the path to the sauna is right here. The following pool of options in turn draws the double facade.

40|$|During the {{transition}} period between Pleistocene and Holocene, from 20 000 to 8000 BC, river valleys were subject {{to the impact of}} vistulian ice-sheet or to the influence of periglacial climate. Their development was dependent on their width and position in relation {{to the edge of the}} ice-sheet. In the southern part of the Polish Plain three areas where advanced river valley research is carried out can be distinguished (Fig. l). The frrst of these is the middle Vistula valley which was formed by water inflow from the upper montainous part of the basin and by the direct influence of the Scandinavian ice-sheet. The second area where research is the most advanced methodologically encloses the Prosna river valley and the middle Warta river valley. The Prosna valley was situated in a periglacial zone and the Proma base level changed according to the vistulian ice-sheet location. The middle Warta river valley was embraced by the Leszno stage zone and thus is of pradolina origin. The Łódź Upland situated on a watershed is the third area of valley studies. Here the research is concerned with the upper parts of small valleys, where climatic and glacial factors did not mingle with each other. Also investigations of denudational valley infI 1 l are valuable for the valley studies. During {{the transition}}al period three stages of river valley development (Fig. 2) can be recognized: 1. 20000 - 14 500 B. C. - the braided river phase with glacial, periglacial and mixed supplies. Aggradation of valley floors was characteristic of the phase and cut and built <b>terace</b> formation occured rarely. 2. 14 500 - 10 000 B. C. - the complex phase of valley floor cutting with simultaneous change from braided to widely meandering channel patterns. Present results show that the alternation did not occur at the same time in diITerent valleys or even fragments of valleys and was strongly dependent on local conditions. 3. 10000 - 8000 B. C. - the meandering river phase with decreasing meander proportions untill mezo-Holocene. In general the state of knowledge od valley development in non-glaciated regions of the Polish Plain in {{the transition period}} is regarded as advanced. That is, to a considerable extent, the result of various conditions in the areas where the studies are conducted. It is recommended that the research methods should be perfected and standardized. This would enable the distinction and comparision of local and general determinants of valley evolution to be made more precisely. Expansion of model application from the Warta river study area to others would speed the transition from quality to quantity characteristics of the process. Zebrano poglądy na temat ewolucji dolin w okresie przejściowym plejstocen - holocen (20000 - 8000 lat BP) na nizinnych, ekstraglacjalnych obszarach Polski. Podkreślono różnorodność typów i wielkości dolin oraz wynikającą z nich złożoność procesów w omawianym okresie. We wszystkich dolinach należy wyróżnić trzy główne fazy rozwoju: l) 20000 - 14500 lat BP - faza rzeki roztokowej o zasilaniu glacjalnym iflub peryglacjalnym i przewadze agradacji den dolinnych, 2) 14 500 - 10000 lat BP - wieloetapowe rozcinanie dolin, a jednocześnie zmiana odpływu roztokowego na meandrujący (meandry wielkopromienne), 3) 10000 [...] 8000 lat BP - faza odpływu meandrowego, przejście od meandrów wielkopromiennych do małopromiennych. Znajomość rozwoju dolin ekstraglacjalnych na niżu uznano za zaawansowaną, chociaż stan badań jest bardzo różny, a stosowane metody badawcze często nieporównywalne, co w przyszłości należałoby zmienić...|$|E
