However, National Security Adviser Stephen J.

Sasha, still {{trying to find the}} three, gets confronted by BloodClan warriors, but is able to trick them into fear by telling them she is a Clan warrior out looking for revenge of Tigerstar's death, and the BloodClan cats end up pointing out the direction <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> kits go.|$|E
5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{felt that}} Hindu-Muslim {{co-operation}} {{was necessary for}} political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in {{their opposition to the}} article in an attempt to generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the {{outbreak}} {{coincided with the}} deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E
5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and smelters at Kopperå, and <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials {{would not have been}} possible without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its strong}} sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints {{included}} {{that the game}} had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> changes and additions as making the sequel {{in line with what}} players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series.|$|E

5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what <b>they</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>the</b> senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The White armies were {{established}} by former Tsarist military officers, and included Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army in South Russia, Alexander Kolchak's forces in Siberia, and Nikolai Yudenich's {{troops in the}} newly independent Baltic states. The Whites were bolstered when 35,000 members of the Czech Legion – prisoners of war from the conflict with the Central Powers – turned against Sovnarkom and allied with the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly (Komuch), an anti-Bolshevik government established in Samara. The Whites were also backed by Western governments who perceived the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a betrayal of the Allied war effort and feared the Bolsheviks' calls for world revolution. In 1918, the United Kingdom, France, United States, Canada, Italy, and Serbia landed 10,000 troops in Murmansk, seizing Kandalaksha, while later that year British, American, and Japanese forces landed in Vladivostok. Western troops soon {{pulled out of the}} civil war, instead only supporting the Whites with officers, technicians and armaments, but Japan remained because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> conflict as an opportunity for territorial expansion.|$|E
5|$|While the Marathas were {{fighting}} the Mughals {{in the early}} 18th century, the British held small trading posts in Mumbai, Madras and Calcutta. The British fortified the naval post of Mumbai after <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Marathas defeat the Portuguese at neighbouring Vasai in May 1739. In {{an effort to keep}} the Marathas out of Mumbai, the British sent envoys to negotiate a treaty. The envoys were successful, and a treaty was signed on 12 July 1739 that gave the British East India Company rights to free trade in Maratha territory. In the south, the Nizam of Hyderabad had enlisted the support of the French for his war against the Marathas. In reaction to this, the Peshwa requested support from the British, but was refused. Unable to see the rising power of the British, the Peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal Maratha conflicts. Despite the lack of support, the Marathas managed to defeat the Nizam over a period of five years.|$|E

5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} men {{eventually}} {{made their way}} to Pine Ridge. Among the first was Lieutenant Eric Plant's platoon from the 9th Battalion. Captain John Whitham's company of the 12th Battalion moved forward from Bolton's Ridge when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> 6th Battalion moving up behind them. As the 6th Battalion reached the ridge, the companies carried on towards Gun Ridge, while Lieutenant-Colonel Walter McNicoll established the battalion headquarters below Bolton's Ridge. As the 6th Battalion moved forward they were engaged by Turkish small arms and artillery fire, causing heavy casualties. At 10:00 brigade headquarters received a message from the 6th Battalion asking for reinforcement, and McCay sent half the 5th Battalion to assist. At the same time the 8th Battalion were digging in on Bolton's, except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of Turks that had come up from the south behind the 6th Battalion. By noon the 8th Battalion was dug in on the ridge; in front of them were scattered remnants of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th Battalions, mostly out of view of each other in the scrub. Shortly after, McCay was informed that if he wanted the 6th Battalion to hold its position, it must be reinforced. So McCay sent his last reserves, a company of the 1st Battalion, and ordered the 8th to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the 6th Battalion. The scattered formations managed to hold their positions {{for the remainder of the}} afternoon, then at 17:00 saw large numbers of Turkish troops coming over the southern section of Gun Ridge.|$|E
