5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> <b>To</b> Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
5|$|Rashid Ali al-Gaylani {{presented}} <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> the parliament, {{his government}} fell, however, {{before it was}} legislated and Jamil al-Midfai's government enacted conscription in February 1934.|$|E
50|$|The {{defendant}} Peoni possessed {{bills that}} he knew to be counterfeit. He sold <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> Regno, and Regno sold <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> Dorsey.

At the trial level, Peoni was convicted as an accomplice to Dorsey's possession of <b>the</b> counterfeit <b>bills.</b>|$|R

5|$|A reptile {{becomes the}} {{official}} state symbol {{after it is}} voted in by the state legislature. Although many states require <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> be signed by the governor, in some the enabling act is a resolution (legislature vote only). In 2004, Illinois held a popular vote to pick the painted turtle, but legislation was still required in 2005 to make the choice official.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> die in the closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E

5000|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> facing <b>the</b> Indianapolis Colts in week 5, Johnson {{suffered}} a separated rib cartilage {{during the first}} quarter and left the game. [...] Appearing in relief, Flutie led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a 31-24 victory over the Colts with 24 unanswered points in the second half. While Johnson was still recovering from his injury, Flutie led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> four consecutive wins before Phillips officially named him the new starting quarterback on November 5, 1998. Speaking to the media following the announcement, Johnson publicly expressed his displeasure, erroneously saying, [...] "I'm not a backup." [...] Flutie led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a 10-6 record before losing to the Miami Dolphins {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} game of the 2005 season (Losman's first {{professional}} start), Losman led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a 22-7 victory over the Houston Texans. Losman subsequently struggled with his accuracy and, consequently, his confidence; with those struggles followed consecutive Bills losses. This eventually led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> bench Losman in favor of veteran quarterback Kelly Holcomb in the fifth game of the 2005 season. After Holcomb suffered a head injury in the first quarter of the Bills' Week 10 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Losman returned to the lineup and threw two quick touchdown strikes to Lee Evans, leading <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a 14-3 victory. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> went on <b>to</b> lose all but one of their remaining games in 2005 with Holcomb and Losman splitting time under center.|$|R
5|$|May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives {{voted to}} pass the American Health Care Act (and thereby repeal most of the Affordable Care Act) by a narrow margin of 217 to 213, sending <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> the Senate for deliberation. The Senate Republican {{leadership}} announced that Senate Republicans would write {{their own version of}} the bill, instead of voting on the House version.|$|E
5|$|The Government amended <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> delay {{debate for}} six months. As expected, the bill then fell when the Dáil was {{dissolved}} {{in the intervening}} period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that {{the real reason for}} the delay was that the Government did not want to enact this type of social legislation {{in the face of an}} election.|$|E

5000|$|In Week Three, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> {{traveled}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Houston Astrodome {{and faced}} the [...] "Run and Shoot" [...] Oilers. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> raced <b>to</b> a 27-10 lead in the third, but the Oilers exploded and the two teams combined for 45 points to force overtime. In overtime a missed Tony Zendejas kick allowed <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> win on Jim Kelly's 28-yard score to Andre Reed. <b>The</b> 47-41 <b>Bills</b> win remains <b>the</b> highest-scoring game between the two franchises. Kelly finished with five touchdown throws.|$|R

5|$|Under section 14 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, a {{bill which}} has been {{approved}} by the Northern Ireland Assembly is presented to the Queen by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for royal assent after a four-week waiting period during which the Attorney General for Northern Ireland may refer <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court. Assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the Northern Ireland (Royal Assent to Bills) Order 1999.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} {{of civil rights}} groups began a court challenge of the bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the State Supreme Court decision in the case of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E

Florence and the Machine were moved from second-top on <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> Friday's headliner, while Florence's vacant gap was filled by Reading & Leeds headliners The Libertines, and their performance was well received. Kanye West and The Who were the headliners for the Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Other notable acts who performed included Motörhead (their final festival appearance in the UK before Lemmy's death), Pharrell Williams, Deadmau5, Patti Smith, the Strypes, Lionel Richie, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Enter Shikari, the Chemical Brothers, Thee Faction, Alt-J, Paloma Faith, Mary J.

50|$|For Week 2, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> {{traveled}} <b>to</b> Dolphin Stadium {{to take on}} {{the second}} of their three divisional rivals, the Miami Dolphins. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> managed <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> only score of the first half, a 33-yard field goal by kicker Rian Lindell in the first quarter. It wasn’t until the third quarter that <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> were <b>to</b> score again when quarterback J. P. Losman threw a 4-yard pass to Josh Reed, while Lindell kicked a pair of FGs, a 45-yarder and a 43-yarder. Even though the Dolphins did manage to score in the fourth quarter on a 23-yard pass from Daunte Culpepper to Chris Chambers (with a failed 2-point conversion), <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> defense dominated <b>the</b> game, sacking Culpepper seven times (along with two forced fumbles) and blocking a punt, improving <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> 1-1.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> led 24-9 just 5:59 {{into the}} third quarter, but the Raiders outscored them 29-0 after that, {{including}} a pair of 1-yard touchdown runs from Latavius Murray <b>to</b> drop <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> 6-6.|$|R

5|$|A new women's {{suffrage}} {{bill was}} introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on 21 August 1946. It {{was necessary to}} wait {{more than a year}} before the House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Perón signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> Eva, symbolically making it hers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The aim of the act was to improve the government's {{ability to deal with}} terrorism. It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> pass. The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E
5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
50|$|In the 1998 offseason, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> signed Rob Johnson {{as a free}} agent. Johnson {{gained a}} {{considerable}} amount of interest around the league after playing well in a Week 1 contest against the Ravens, and was expected to become the primary quarterback for <b>the</b> <b>Bills.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> also signed former CFL star Doug Flutie after A.J. Smith, their Director of Pro Personnel, heavily valued his talents. Johnson only led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a 1-3 start before being injured {{in the middle of his}} fifth start in Week 6 at Indianapolis. Flutie came in and not only led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a come-from-behind win, but earned the starting job and led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a 7-3 record after the game <b>to</b> lead <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a 10-6 record and Wild Card berth. In 1999, Flutie's stats were down with 19 touchdowns against 16 interceptions, but he went 10-5 as a starter and led <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> a second Wild Card berth. With a playoff berth decided, Wade Phillips decided to let Johnson start the Week 17 game against the AFC East division champion, the Colts. Johnson played well in Flutie's place, going 24-32 for 287 yards and 2 touchdowns with no interceptions in a 31-6 win. The following day, Phillips told Johnson he would start in their first round playoff game against the Titans. Years later, Phillips claimed that it was not his decision to start Rob Johnson, and that owner Ralph Wilson had ordered him to do so. It remains unknown to this day why <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> started Johnson, but it is possible that <b>the</b> investments <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> had spent on the players played a key role. While Flutie was a low-cost signing for <b>the</b> <b>Bills,</b> Johnson was being paid $25 million over 4 years with the expectation that he become the Bills' franchise quarterback. As a result, Wilson may have wanted to see a return on his investment.|$|R
50|$|Conkright {{signed as}} an end and center coach for <b>the</b> AAFC's Buffalo <b>Bills</b> in April 1947. In moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills,</b> he rejoined Tom Stidham, his old head coach at Oklahoma. Stidham was working as the Bills' line coach. Conkright {{convinced}} <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>to</b> put into place Brown's version of the T formation offense, and the team improved in the 1947 and 1948 seasons. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1948 AAFC championship, but lost the game to the Browns.|$|R

5|$|Chances {{the bill}} would be passed ended in November 2004 when House Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly decided not to bring <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E
5|$|In June the {{subcommittee}} met {{to mark up}} the bill. Bordallo's amendment tightening the language prohibiting vessel transport of fins was passed by voice vote. A week later the full committee, after adding an amendment by Faleomavaega requiring that fins {{be attached to the}} carcasses, sent <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> the full House. In July it was passed by voice vote and referred to the Senate, where it was sponsored by John Kerry of Massachusetts. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. No further action was taken before the 110th Congress adjourned, and the bill died.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
50|$|Once introduced, a bill must {{go through}} a number of stages before it can become law.
