5|$|Bypass US Highway131 (Byp. US131) was a {{bypass route}} around {{downtown}} Grand Rapids. The highway followed 28th Street eastward from <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with US131 (Division Street) south of downtown. From this starting point eastward, it ran concurrently with Byp. US16 and Byp M-21. M-37 also followed 28th Street {{at the time}} eastward from <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> at Kalamazoo Avenue. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with East Beltline and Broadmoor avenues in Paris Township (now Kentwood), Byp.US16/Byp. US131/Byp.M-21 turned northward to follow East Beltline, and M-37 turned southward on Broadmoor. The bypass route continued northward through Grand Rapids Township. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with US16/M-50 (Cascade Road), Byp. US16 ended, and Byp. M-21 ended {{less than half a}} mile (0.4km) north of that at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with M-21 (Fulton Street). North of <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with Fulton Street, Byp. US131 was the only designation along East Beltline Avenue at the time. The highway ran northward into Plainfield Township, and it terminated at an intersection with US131 at Plainfield Avenue and Northland Drive just south of the Grand River.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} golf course behind, PA106 makes a gradual turn to the {{southeast}} at Crystal Lake Road. There, the highway becomes known as Fall Brook Road, and turns southward through forestry. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with43rd Street, PA106 enters the city of Carbondale. The route, known now as Fallbrook Street, continues on a southeastern trend, entering a large residential district north of the business district. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with Dundaff Street, it turns southward again, paralleling a nearby river. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with River Street, PA106 turns eastward along Salem Avenue, crosses the river and intersects with US 6 Bus. (North Main Street) in Carbondale. At that intersection, the PA106 designation terminates while Salem Avenue continues as SR1019 through Carbondale.|$|E

5|$|As a two-lane roadway, M-199 {{starts at}} exit119 along I-94 {{northwest}} of Albion in Sheridan Township. The highway runs southward through farm fields along 26Mile Road before curving {{to the southwest}} on Star Commonwealth Road near {{the campus of the}} Montcalm School for Boys and Girls, a private boarding school. At the end of this curves, the highway follows 25½Mile Road southward to <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with Michigan Avenue. There M-199 turns easterly along Michigan Avenue and passes south of Montcalm Lake. The trunkline runs parallel to a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway until about <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with 26½Mile Road. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with 27Mile Road, M-199 enters the city of Albion, and the street name changes to Austin Avenue. In town, the highway follows a four-lane street through residential neighborhoods. The trunkline passes the northern edge of McAuliffe Park and runs parallel to the Kalamazoo River. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with Eaton Street, the highway meets BL I-94, where M-199 ends while the business loop continues southeasterly on Austin Avenue at this corner.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway 23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} loop through downtown Bay City. It started at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> of where US23 turned off Broadway Street westward onto Lafayette Avenue. From this point, Bus. US23 ran east on Lafayette Avenue for two blocks and then turned northward onto Garfield Avenue, running parallel to, but inland from, the Saginaw River into downtown Bay City. As it approached downtown, the business loop jogged off Garfield onto Washington Avenue. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with 7th Street, Bus. US23 turned westward to cross the Saginaw River. On the opposite side, the business loop followed Jenny Street westbound and Thomas Street eastbound along a one-way pairing of streets. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with US23 (Euclid Avenue), the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} route through downtown Fenton. At {{the time it was}} turned over to local control, it was signed as business spur from downtown to the US23 freeway, but the state maintained a southern section that previously completed the route as a loop. At the southern end, this unsigned highway started at US23 at the Owen Road interchange (exit78) and continued eastward on Owen Road past Fenton High School and various businesses. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with Shiawassee Avenue, Bus. US23 followed Shiawassee through a residential area toward the southern end of downtown. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with LeRoy Street, the unsigned business loop turned northward and across the Shiawassee River. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with River Street, state maintenance ended. On the northern end of downtown at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> of LeRoy Street and Silver Lake Road, it resumed. Bus. US23 followed Silver Lake Road westward out of downtown through a residential area and northwesterly to an interchange with US23 at exit79.|$|E

5|$|Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) was a {{bypass route}} of M-21 in Kent County. It started at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> between M-21 (Chicago Drive) and 28th Street in Grandville. From there, it was routed eastward along 28th Street running {{concurrently}} with Byp. US16. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with US131 (Division Street) on the Wyoming–Paris township line, a Byp. US131 started and ran concurrently eastward along 28th Street. Byp. US16/Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 continued along 28th Street in Paris Township to an intersection with Kalamazoo Avenue where M-37 turned off Kalamazoo and onto 28th Street. Further east, 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue intersected. At that junction, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 turned northward along East Beltline while M-37 turned south and Byp. US16 continued eastward on 28th Street. Running northward in Grand Rapids Township, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 intersected US16/M-50 at Cascade Road before Byp. M-21 terminated at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with M-21 (Fulton Street).|$|E
5|$|From the Rutgers Street intersection, Route 7 {{continues}} along Washington Avenue {{for about}} {{a mile and a}} half before reaching Nutley, still continuing on Washington Avenue into Nutley. At <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with County Route 646 (Park Avenue), Route 7 turns into a municipally maintained road and enters a more residential area. Upon intersecting County Route 606 (Kingsland Road), Route 7 crosses into Clifton, Passaic County and heads to the west on county-maintained Kingsland Street signed eastwest. Kingsland, carrying Route 7, crosses back into Nutley, regaining state maintenance. When Kingsand becomes County Route 644 at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> with Cathedral Avenue, Route 7 turns north from Kingsland onto Cathedral Avenue and comes to its terminus at Orange St in Nutley. However, signage continues to indicate Route 7 up to the terminus of Cathedral Avenue at interchange with Route 3 at <b>the</b> <b>intersection</b> of Cathedral Avenue, Passaic Avenue, and Ward Avenue.|$|E
