5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> try to attract females {{with which to}} mate. Females are free to move in between <b>territories,</b> <b>and</b> are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E

5|$|As they {{stake out}} their <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command did not {{pay much attention to}} these <b>territories,</b> <b>and</b> funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed under the supervision of Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E

50|$|On May 30, 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act {{created the}} Kansas <b>Territory</b> <b>and</b> the Nebraska <b>Territory,</b> {{divided by the}} 40th {{parallel}} north. The Pike's Peak Gold Rush of 1858-1861 lured thousands of gold seekers into the goldfields of the northwestern Kansas <b>Territory</b> <b>and</b> the southwestern Nebraska Territory. On February 28, 1861, the western portion of the Kansas <b>Territory</b> <b>and</b> the southwestern portion of the Nebraska Territory were incorporated into the new Colorado Territory. The 40th parallel became the primary baseline for surveying the land in the eastern portion of the new <b>territory,</b> <b>and</b> a road was eventually cut along the survey baseline.|$|R
5|$|Hong Kong {{comprises}} three geographical regions, which {{coincided with}} its historical expansion by the British colonial government: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon (1860) and the New <b>Territories</b> <b>and</b> Outlying Islands (1898).

5|$|The {{conflict}} {{coincided with}} the Dutch Revolt, 1568–1648, encouraging {{the participation of the}} rebellious Dutch provinces and the Spanish. The successful conclusion of the war consolidated Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> encouraged a Catholic revival on the lower Rhine. Importantly, it also set a precedent for outside intervention in German religious and dynastic conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The victory, {{achieved}} at relatively little cost, cleared the Lado Enclave of Mahdist rebels and secured Rejaf as a Belgian base for future {{operations in the}} surrounding <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> along the Nile.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an interpretive {{alternative}} {{to the idea of}} the state as sovereign over a <b>territory</b> <b>and</b> possessing a monopoly of power. It interprets both <b>Territory</b> <b>and</b> Power (the book by Bulpitt) <b>and</b> <b>territory</b> <b>and</b> power (the objects studied in that book). Bulpitt’s ideas were part of a broader movement to rethink the state to (i) accommodate new behavioral topics, and (ii) to defend modernist empiricism and institutionalism from the positivism and general theories of behavioralism. Now we might adopt an alternative interpretive approach. An interpretive approach decenters <b>territory</b> <b>and</b> power, revealing them to be contingent products of struggles over meanings in which the beliefs of some actors come to dominate, obscure, and even obliterate those of others...|$|R

5|$|After {{losing the}} {{election}} to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery in the <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the {{two sides}} had called a truce. Despite the truce, both sides planned for war. In a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany {{priority}} over Italy as a theater of war. The First French Republic's finances were in poor shape so its armies would be expected to invade new <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> then live off the conquered lands. Knowing that the French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E

5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids.
