5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> his professorial and garden duties, {{by the late}} 1870s <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look at him through his window.|$|E
5|$|Instead of a {{one-time}} write-off, German economist Harald Spehl {{has called for}} a 30-year debt-reduction plan, similar to the one Germany used after World War II to share <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> reconstruction and development.

Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E

5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> {{proof of}} {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, {{in the first}} instance, on the detaining authority.

Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E

5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

The expenditure was recorded in still-surviving Treasury accounts which provide a valuable insight into {{the development of the}} castle during the later medieval period. In the 1180s the defences appear to have been a combination of stone walls (the old Roman structure) with Norman modifications, plus earthworks and timber palisades. They were maintained in part by some of the local manors, which were under a feudal obligation called heckage that required them to repair and keep up sections of the palisades.|$|E
