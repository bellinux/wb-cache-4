5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a <b>tapping</b> <b>range</b> of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap selector units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter switch assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil.

30|$|The beat level tempo, {{which is}} what we are {{interested}} in at this point, {{can be viewed as a}} periodicity in the envelope function. A commonly used method to detect periodicities in a function is autocorrelation [8, 27]. The periodic autocorrelation is computed over a small window (10 seconds) of the envelope function. The index of the highest peak in the autocorrelation function (ACF) indicates the strongest periodicity. However, as findings in [28] suggest, the strongest periodicity in the signal may not always be the dominant periodicity perceived. The findings suggest an interval of preferred tapping linked to a supposed resonance between our perceptual and motor system. Still, as a first guess, which will work fairly well on music with strong beats in the preferred <b>tapping</b> <b>range,</b> the highest peak can be assumed to indicate the beat level tempo. We also have to combine the results from all bands. The simplest way is to add up the ACF of all bands and pick the highest peak in the summary ACF (SACF). Determining the tempo for each band and choosing the tempo that was detected in the majority of bands as the final tempo is an alternative method. Dixon describes a tempo induction method based on autocorrelation in [2]. Uhle et al. use autocorrelation for meter detection in [8].|$|E

40|$|Commercialization (private sector or Non-SBIR federal funding) of federally {{sponsored}} innovations {{is a key}} congressionally mandated goal of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. While {{much attention}} has focused on quantifying and assessing the commercial outputs of the SBIR program, limited research exists on the impact that business advisory support initiatives have on project commercialization. These programs, such as the Navy 2 ̆ 7 s Transition Assistance Program (TAP), seek to augment the business capacity of SBIR/STTR award recipients by providing information and resources focused on facilitating the commercialization process. I hypothesize that these programs increase the probability of commercialization success for participating SBIR Phase II projects. To test this hypothesis, I employed a logistic regression model exploring commercialization outcomes from participants and non-participants from the Navy 2 ̆ 7 s Transition Assistance Program (TAP). A dataset comprised of 993 Navy Phase II projects awarded between 2005 and 2008 was used to populate the model. The self-reported commercialization outcomes contained in the dataset include 537 Navy TAP projects, and a comparison group of 456 Navy Phase II projects who opted {{not to participate in}} the program during the years covered. The resulting analysis found that the odds of success given that a project participated in the Navy <b>TAP</b> <b>ranged</b> from 1. 5 to 6. 2 times the odds of success for a non-participating project, depending upon firm characteristics.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterised by {{difficulty}} with the timing of movements. Data collected using the synchronization-continuation paradigm, an established motor timing paradigm, have produced varying results but with most studies finding impairment. Some of this inconsistency comes from variation in the medication state tested, in the inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) selected, and in changeable focus on either the synchronization (tapping in time with a tone) or continuation (maintaining the rhythm {{in the absence of}} the tone) phase. We sought to re-visit the paradigm by testing across four groups of participants: healthy controls, medication na&# 239;ve de novo PD patients, and treated PD patients both ‘on’ and ‘off’ dopaminergic medication. Four finger tapping intervals (ISI) were used: 250 ms, 500 ms, 1000 ms and 2000 ms. Categorical predictors (group, ISI, and phase) were used to predict accuracy and variability using a linear mixed model. Accuracy was defined as the relative error of a tap, and variability as the deviation of the participant’s tap from group predicted relative error. Our primary finding is that the treated PD group (PD patients ‘on’ and ‘off’ dopaminergic therapy) showed a significantly different pattern of accuracy compared to the de novo group and the healthy controls at the 250 ms interval. At this interval, the treated PD patients performed ‘ahead’ of the beat whilst the other groups performed ‘behind’ the beat. We speculate that this ‘hastening’ relates to the clinical phenomenon of motor festination. Across all groups, variability was smallest for both phases at the 500 ms interval, suggesting an innate preference for finger <b>tapping</b> within this <b>range.</b> <b>Tapping</b> variability for the two phases became increasingly divergent at the longer intervals, with worse performance in the continuation phase. The data suggest that patients with PD can be best discriminated from healthy controls on measures of motor timing accuracy, rather than variability...|$|R

5000|$|Jackson {{also asked}} Coblentz to oversee {{a trio of}} RPI {{operations}} focused on intellectual property protection and technology transfer: the Rensselaer Incubator, the Office of Technology Commercialization, and the 1250-acre Rensselaer Technology Park. Coblentz created the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Council to bring coherence to university wide tech transfer operations, [...] and revamped the RPI incubation approach, launching the Emerging Ventures Ecosystem (EVE) in February 2011. The EVE concept used a “distributed incubation” approach, placing RPI student and faculty start-up businesses in downtown Troy, integrating RPI’s academic prowess in engineering and entrepreneurship with a local focus on urban renewal and drawing on the global RPI network of successful alumni entrepreneurs. “Our goal is to facilitate and ‘turbo-charge,’ if you like, every aspect of technology transfer, from idea generation to patenting and licensing to global growth,” Coblentz said. “To do that, we intend to <b>tap</b> the entire <b>range</b> of Rensselaer resources, and to create partnerships that take symbiotic advantage of strengths in the local community, for mutual benefit.” ...|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{detecting}} and concentrating animal viruses from {{large volumes of}} water and wastewater have experienced rapid development in recent years, {{but only a few}} methods are available for the concentration of bacteriophages. The present study describes the use of a charge-modified (Zeta Plus) filter aid (AMF Cuno, Meriden, Conn.) for the concentration of coliphages from large volumes of water and sewage. Coliphages MS- 2 and f 2 were efficiently adsorbed from water and sewage to the positively charged filter aid. Elution was accomplished with 4 % beef extract [...] 0. 5 M NaCl adjusted to pH 9. 5. The recovery of f 2 from 10 - to 20 -liter volumes of <b>tap</b> water <b>ranged</b> between 11 and 70 %, and the recovery of MS- 2 ranged between 43 and 70 %. The efficiency of recovery of naturally occurring coliphages from secondarily treated sewage ranged between 16 and 44 %. This technique appears to be promising because it requires low-cost equipment (47 -mm polypropylene filter housing), is easy to handle, and can filter large volumes of water (greater than or equal to 20 liters) with good recoveries. Filtrations can be conducted at the ambient pH of the water, and the unit cost per filtration (i. e., the cost of filter aid) comes to less than three cents per sampling. The technique could be useful in evaluation of viral water quality, study of ecology and occurrence of phages in natural waters, and isolation of rare phages from natural waters...|$|R
40|$|Coal dust {{contains}} {{trace elements}} of major/minor concern {{due to their}} potential impact on human health. Residential households in relatively close proximity to a coal dust source, such as a coal terminal, report that coal dust soils laundry and impacts upon visibility in the atmosphere. One question often asked is - does coal dust {{pose a threat to}} human health after being deposited on a rooftop and being washed into the rainwater tank? The answer lies in the likelihood and amount of coal dust (and trace elements) reaching the roof and being transferred to the tank; the potential for leaching of trace elements within the water column in the rainwater tank; and the water quality of rainwater at the point of use (kitchen <b>tap).</b> A <b>range</b> of coal types were supplied by the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal (DBCT) which reflected the likely composition of existing coal dust in the area. Leaching experiments were undertaken on a range of coal types (of particle size < 63 μm) {{to determine the extent of}} elemental leaching from the coal dust to the rainwater. In addition, water samples from three households (tanks and taps) in the Dalrymple Bay area were obtained and tested for elements considered both a major and minor concern in coal. Leaching experiments suggest that major/minor trace elements in the coal dust are not likely to be a main contributor to trace elements found in rainwater; and in fact may assist in removing some trace elements from the rainwater in the tank. Water samples from all three households recorded concentrations far lower than Australian Drinking Water Guidelines for all tested elements...|$|R
40|$|Background: Accurate data on {{coverage}} of key maternal, newborn, {{and child health}} (MNCH) interventions are crucial for monitoring progress toward the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. Coverage estimates are primarily obtained from routine population surveys through self-reporting, the validity of which is not well understood. We aimed to examine {{the validity of the}} {{coverage of}} selected MNCH interventions in Gongcheng County, China. Method and Findings: We conducted a validation study by comparing women’s self-reported coverage of MNCH interventions relating to antenatal and postnatal care, mode of delivery, and child vaccinations in a community survey with their paper- and electronic-based health care records, treating the health care records as the reference standard. Of 936 women recruited, 914 (97. 6 %) completed the survey. Results show that self-reported coverage of these interventions had moderate to high sensitivity (0. 57 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 50 – 0. 63] to 0. 99 [95 % CI: 0. 98 – 1. 00]) and low to high specificity (0 to 0. 83 [95 % CI: 0. 80 – 0. 86]). Despite varying overall validity, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging between 0. 49 [95 % CI: 0. 39 – 0. 57] and 0. 90 [95 % CI: 0. 88 – 0. 92], bias in the coverage estimates at the population level was small to moderate, with the test to actual positive (<b>TAP)</b> ratio <b>ranging</b> between 0. 8 and 1. 5 for 24 of the 28 indicators examined. Our ability to accurately estimate validity was affected by several caveats associated with the reference standard. Caution should be exercised when generalizing the results to other settings...|$|R
