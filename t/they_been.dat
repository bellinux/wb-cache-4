5|$|Australia {{became the}} first team to win three World Cups, and {{registered}} a record 17 consecutive ODI wins. They also {{became the first}} team to win all the matches in a World Cup tournament. Writing for the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Simon Wilde remarked that Australia would have beaten a Rest of the World XI had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> asked.|$|E
5|$|I {{have never}} {{mentioned}} the boy's name except to Probyn, Montagu and Knollys {{when they were}} acting for me and I thought they ought to know. Had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> wise, hearing what I knew and therefore what others knew, {{they ought to have}} hushed the matter up, instead of stirring it up as they did, with all the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies of}} the {{events leading up to}} the tragedy found several factors {{contributing}} to the extent of the damage. A. Malheiro (2006) linked five major causes to damage from these earthquakes. The buildings most damaged by the earthquake were near fault lines on top of loosely packed soil. They tended to be of poor construction and did not conform to proper building code, nor had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> adequately examined.|$|E
6000|$|DON JUAN. Pooh! {{why should}} I be civil {{to them or}} to you? In this Palace of Lies a truth or two will not hurt you. Your friends are all the dullest dogs I know. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not beautiful: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only decorated. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not clean: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only shaved and starched. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not dignified: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only fashionably dressed. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not educated <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only college passmen. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not religious: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only pewrenters. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not moral: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only conventional. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not virtuous: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only cowardly. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not even vicious: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only [...] "frail." [...] <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not artistic: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only lascivious. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not prosperous: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only rich. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> not loyal, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only servile; not dutiful, only sheepish; not public spirited, only patriotic; not courageous, only quarrelsome; not determined, only obstinate; not masterful, only domineering; not self-controlled, only obtuse; not self-respecting, only vain; not kind, only sentimental; not social, only gregarious; not considerate, only polite; not intelligent, only opinionated; not progressive, only factious; not imaginative, only superstitious; not just, only vindictive; not generous, only propitiatory; not disciplined, only cowed; and not truthful at all--liars every one of them, to the very {{backbone}} of their souls.|$|R
6000|$|... 17 [...] These {{are really}} the {{thoughts}} of all men in all ages and lands, <b>they</b> [...] <b>are</b> not original with me, [...] If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not yours as much as mine <b>they</b> <b>are</b> nothing, or next to nothing, [...] If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not the riddle and the untying of the riddle <b>they</b> <b>are</b> nothing, [...] If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not just as close as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> distant <b>they</b> <b>are</b> nothing.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> erected {{outskirt}} {{of villages}} and town mostly. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> also erected near battlefield or place of death if {{is dedicated to}} warrior, Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>are</b> erected near temples or places of worship.

5|$|The Vrba–Wetzler {{report was}} not {{distributed}} widely until weeks after Vrba's escape in April 1944. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews (12,000 a day) were deported to Auschwitz. Vrba believed {{they would have}} run or fought had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> told they were being sent to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a complete German and Italian victory. The British {{did not have the}} military resources to carry out big simultaneous operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> able to block the Axis advance, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counter-thrust across the Balkans. The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Montana-class battleships {{would have}} been similar to the preceding Iowa-class battleships, but {{with an increase in}} the number of primary guns and more potent secondary guns for use against enemy surface ships and aircraft. Had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> completed, the Montanas {{would have been}} gun-for-gun the most powerful battleships the United States had constructed, and the only US battleship class that would have come close to equaling the Imperial Japanese Navy battleships Yamato and Musashi in armament, armor, and displacement.|$|E
6000|$|... "But stop," [...] said Beechnut, as he {{was going}} down the ladder. [...] "It is {{important}} to ascertain whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> eggs or chickens under the hen. For if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> eggs <b>they</b> <b>are</b> one third your property, and if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> chickens, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all mine." ...|$|R
50|$|Tagline, tag line, and tag are American terms. In the U.K. <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{called end}} lines, endlines, or straplines. In Belgium <b>they</b> <b>are</b> called baselines. In France <b>they</b> <b>are</b> signatures. In Germany <b>they</b> <b>are</b> claims. In the Netherlands and Italy, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pay offs or pay-off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{definitions}} above specialize for IF sentences as follows.Two IF sentences [...] are truth equivalent if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> true in {{the same}} structures; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> falsity equivalent if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> false {{in the same}} structures; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> strongly equivalent if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> both truth and falsity equivalent.|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} for the French was dire. Not only had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> trounced in southwestern Germany, the legendary Alexander Suvorov {{was on his way}} to northern Italy with 60,000 Russians, to take command of Coalition forces there. Count Heinrich Bellegarde, positioned with 20,000 men in the Grisons, effectively isolated Masséna's force from any assistance out of Italy. Most threatening, Archduke Charles' main army lay less than a day away; in size alone, it could overwhelm him, or, if he withdrew to the west, its position cut off his avenue of withdrawal toward France. If Charles' left wing, commanded by Nauendorf, united with Hotze's force, approaching from the east, Masséna knew Charles would attack and very likely push him out of Zürich.|$|E
25|$|Much {{junior in}} standing, a superb teacher, a man (I believe) whose powers {{would have taken}} him far as a pioneer into the domain of new {{knowledge}} had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> devoted to research rather than coaching.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} these resolutions, had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> passed, can never be known. Unfortunately, Burke {{delivered}} this speech just {{less than a month}} before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington, and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict.|$|E

40|$|Teachers do {{the right}} thing. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> diligent, persistent, hospitable, idealistic strong and patient. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> disciplined and avoid illicit {{activities}} like smoking and drinking. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> also honest, sincere and kind to others. They take the middle way. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> unbiased. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> wise, reasonable and knowledgeable...|$|R

25|$|The Soviet Union envisaged {{and almost}} {{realized}} various concepts for large cargo submarines during the 1950s and 1960s, though these {{would not have}} been counted as merchant ships, being envisaged as navy landing ships to transport troops. They would have been amongst the largest submarines of their day, had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> built.|$|E
25|$|The fires, {{started by}} {{lightning}} strikes, {{might have been}} contained, had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> attacked more aggressively in the 24 hours after they broke out. Large stretches of dry, drought-affected vegetation and weather conditions that were extremely conducive to fire meant that once the fires reached a certain size, they were very difficult to control.|$|E
25|$|In a September 19, 2008 radio interview, with Aimee Allison and Philip Maldari on Pacifica Radio's KPFA 94.1FM in Berkeley, California, US, Stiglitz {{implied that}} President Clinton and his {{economic}} advisors {{would not have}} backed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> aware of stealth provisions, inserted by lobbyists, that they overlooked.|$|E
50|$|Oh, The {{grand old}} Duke of York,He had ten {{thousand}} men;He marched {{them up to}} the top of the hill,And he marched them down again.And when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> up, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> up,And when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> down, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> down,And when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only half-way up,They were neither up nor down.|$|R

25|$|Tolliver {{argues that}} drama both {{reflects}} and foreshadows social change. It {{is likely that}} there was already much skepticism about the gods in Plautus' era. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but reflected ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus' plays would have been banned, had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> too risqué.|$|E
25|$|In these extreme situations, {{any medical}} care given {{to people who}} will die anyway can be {{considered}} to be care withdrawn from others who might have survived (or perhaps suffered less severe disability from their injuries) had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> treated instead. It becomes the task of the disaster medical authorities to set aside some victims as hopeless, to avoid trying to save one life at the expense of several others.|$|E
25|$|Garriott {{founded the}} company Portalarium in 2009. The company is {{developing}} , a spiritual {{successor to the}} Ultima series, with Garriott having remarked that had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> able to secure {{the rights to the}} Ultima intellectual property from Electronic Arts, the game could literally have become Ultima Online 2 in name. On March 8, 2013, Portalarium launched a Kickstarter campaign for Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues.|$|E
6000|$|And so <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> dear mother; it all agrees. The {{accounts}} are consistent. Do not {{you see how}} very consistent <b>they</b> <b>are?</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> seen at Lerici, and were off Lerici, but they made Sarzana; and George heard <b>they</b> <b>were</b> at Sarzana. I <b>am</b> certain <b>they</b> <b>are</b> at Sarzana. I feel quite easy; I feel as easy as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> here. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> safe at Sarzana.

6000|$|... 'It is {{very easy}} to say what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not, and that is about the extent of any {{knowledge}} that we have of them; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Moslemin, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Christians, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Druses, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Jews, and certainly <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Guebres, for I have spoken of them to the Indians at Djedda, who <b>are</b> fire-worshippers, and <b>they</b> do not in any degree acknowledge them.' ...|$|R

25|$|As soon as wartime {{restrictions}} on producing passenger locomotives were eased in February 1945, the PRR placed {{an order for}} 50 production examples. This was a fateful step, since the problems encountered with the prototypes had not been ironed out nor had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> tested with the intensity required {{to be sure of}} production reliability. The production locomotives differed in detail in their streamlined casings, and in the suspension in an attempt to increase adhesion.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{the removal}} of the child suited the plans of the comte de Provence, now Louis XVIII, along with those of the revolutionary government. The royal family made no serious attempt to {{ascertain}} the truth, though they paid no tributes to the memory of the deceased king as might have been expected, had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> convinced of his death. Even his sister wore no mourning for him until she arrived at Vienna and saw that this was expected of her.|$|E
25|$|Non-scholarly literature, however, {{continued}} {{to rely on}} adaptation. France's Pléiade, England's Tudor poets, and the Elizabethan translators adapted themes by Horace, Ovid, Petrarch and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created {{by the rise of}} a middle class and the development of printing, with works such as the original authors would have written, had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> writing in England in that day.|$|E
