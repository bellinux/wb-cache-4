5|$|On May 8, 1958, the Maryland State Roads Commission and Cecil County {{signed a}} road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement</b> to turn {{maintenance}} of MD 537B {{outside the town}} of Chesapeake City to county maintenance. However, the portion of MD 537B from US 213 to the north town limit was returned to state maintenance through an August 22, 1961, road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement.</b> MD 285 and MD 537B were resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1971 and 1976, respectively. The intersection of MD 537B and MD 284 was transformed from a tangent intersection to the present orthogonal intersection in 1982. The following year, the portion of MD 537B between MD 213 and the intersection of Biddle and Lock streets was renumbered {{as an extension of}} MD 285.|$|E
5|$|Both {{auxiliary}} routes {{were assigned}} after River Road was reconstructed through Morgnec as a westward extension of MD291 in 1962 and 1963.

5|$|US 213 {{was moved}} to the new Chesapeake City Bridge, and MD 537 was {{assigned}} to the bypassed portions of highway approaching and within Chesapeake City. On May 8, 1958, the Maryland State Roads Commission and Cecil County signed a road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement</b> to turn maintenance of the approach roads outside the town of Chesapeake City to county maintenance. These roads included all of MD 537A, most of MD 537D, and much of MD 537B. The portion of MD 537B from US 213 to the north town limit was returned to state maintenance through an August 22, 1961, road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement.</b> All three segments of MD 537 were resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1976. The intersection of MD 537B and MD 284 was transformed from a tangent intersection to the present orthogonal intersection in 1982. The following year, the portion of MD 537B between MD 213 and MD 285's then western terminus at the intersection of Biddle and Lock streets was renumbered as an extension of MD 285. The remainder of MD 537B not maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was transferred to Chesapeake City in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2005, then-Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier {{signed an}} {{agreement}} between Canada's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan. The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement.</b> This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse. However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, {{and it was the}} responsibility of Canada. It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons. While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue. In turn, a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction of the MD 3 {{divided highway}} from Millersville to MD 3 Business began in 1987 over two sections. The first section, from north of MD 3 Business to north of Benfield Boulevard, began in 1987. The work {{included}} {{the construction of}} the flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to Veterans Highway just south of MD 3 Business. The section from north of Benfield Boulevard to MD 178 at Dorrs Corner was reconstructed starting in 1989. The second section included construction of the Benfield Boulevard interchange. The southbound MD 3 roadway was rebuilt in place as the southbound lanes of I-97. New northbound lanes were built immediately to the east of the southbound lanes. In February 1991, the new northbound lanes opened and access from I-97 to Veterans Highway was removed at Dorrs Corner. The old northbound lanes were reconstructed and re-purposed as a two-lane road, Veterans Highway, later that year. Anne Arundel County agreed to accept Veterans Highway for maintenance after the I-97â€“related construction concluded in a road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement</b> on July 21, 1988. MD 3 was truncated at Millersville after I-97 opened in October 1991; signage for MD 3 on I-695 was removed by 1993.|$|E

5|$|What is now MD222 was {{originally}} designated MD268. MD 268 {{was replaced by}} a southern extension of US 222 from US 1 at Conowingo to US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville in 1938. The Susquehanna River Road section of US 222 was transferred from state to county maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement.</b> However, that section was returned to state control through an August 23, 1961, agreement after Cecil County requested it be returned to the state. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved rolling back {{the southern end of the}} US 222 designation from US 40 to US 1 at their April 1995 spring meeting. The Maryland State Highway Administration proposed and AASHTO approved the redesignation of US 222 to MD 222 from US 40 to US 1 in February 1996; however, the new designation had already been enacted officially and marked publicly in 1995. The redesignation did not apply to Aiken Avenue; indeed, Aiken Avenue's designation was changed from US 222 to MD 222 in 1972.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Bevin's {{administration}} sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky ordering it to stop performing abortions at its clinic in Louisville {{because it did not}} have the required license. The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform the procedures by Beshear's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office, but nonetheless halted the procedures on January 28. Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February, claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license; the suit said Planned Parenthood's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications, as required by state law, and that Beshear's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved. Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there. In March, the University of Louisville Hospital announced that it had backed out of a <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement</b> with Planned Parenthood, saying it had been pressured to do so and felt that its state funding was in jeopardy by continuing in the agreement. A spokesman for Bevin denied that the pressure had come from anyone in the administration.|$|E

25|$|Tolchester Beach {{was a major}} {{resort on}} the Chesapeake Bay that {{featured}} a hotel, pavilion, swimming, and amusement park rides. The resort opened in 1877 and thrived with the traffic generated by steamboat excursions from various ports on the bay, including Baltimore. However, the rise of more modern resorts caused a long decline; Tolchester Beach closed in 1962. Tolchester Beach Road was constructed as a concrete road in 1924 and 1925 to connect the Tolchester Beach resort to the Rock HallChestertown road at McClean's Corner. By 1927, a ferry connected Tolchester Beach with the Inner Harbor of Baltimore. This ferry service continued until between 1940 and 1946. MD 21 was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1975. The highway's westernmost , measured from the high-water mark of the Chesapeake Bay, was transferred from state to county maintenance through a August 16, 1990, road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement.</b> The western terminus of MD 21 was moved again, this time to MD 445's northern terminus, when the portion of MD 21 between MD 445 and Tolchester Beach was transferred from state to county maintenance through a June 1, 1993, road <b>transfer</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
