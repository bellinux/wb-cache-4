Though she had {{originally}} been equipped with 21 five-inch (127mm)/51 cal guns to defend against enemy destroyers, <b>this</b> <b>number</b> was reduced to 12 in 1918, due to the overly wet bow and stern positions of the other nine.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the road, {{already under}} way by this stage, was then free to {{continue}} largely unhindered, although systematic sabotage of building sites by local people continued.

5|$|From {{the bone}} {{features}} of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, {{it is estimated that}} Acrocanthosaurus requires at least 12 years to fully grow. <b>This</b> <b>number</b> may be much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for these lines, Acrocanthosaurus needs 18–24 years to be mature.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus doubles <b>this</b> <b>number</b> {{to account}} for support {{personnel}} and thus he reports that the whole army numbered 5,283,220 men.

The number of heterosexual unmarried couples in the United States has increased tenfold, from about 400,000 in 1960 to more than five million in 2005. <b>This</b> <b>number</b> would increase by at least another 594,000 if same-sex partners were included.

5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 clues, {{although}} finding them is not a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues {{have been found}} with 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if <b>this</b> <b>number</b> of clues is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if <b>this</b> <b>number</b> of clues is minimal for this case.|$|E
25|$|Fair Lawn uses {{a street}} address {{numbering}} {{system in which}} most Fair Lawn addresses are given hyphenated numbers, such as 10-13 Some Street.

Exceptions to <b>this</b> <b>numbering</b> system generally exist on the Glen Rock, Hawthorne, and Saddle Brook sides of Fair Lawn and within the Radburn development.

5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted these numbers, {{especially since the}} ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point.
