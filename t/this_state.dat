5|$|Cells {{can deal}} with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating osmoprotectants such as betaines or {{trehalose}} in their cytosol. Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis.
