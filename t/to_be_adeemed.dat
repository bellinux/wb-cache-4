50|$|Ademption, or {{ademption}} by extinction, is {{a common}} law doctrine used in the law of wills to determine what happens when property bequeathed under a will {{is no longer in}} the testator's estate {{at the time of the}} testator's death. For a devise (bequest) of a specific item of property (a specific gift), such property <b>is</b> considered <b>adeemed,</b> and the gift fails. For example, if a will bequeathed the testator's car to a specific beneficiary, but the testator owned no car at the time of his or her death, the gift would <b>be</b> <b>adeemed</b> and the aforementioned beneficiary would receive no gift at all.|$|R

50|$|In Barrow v The Master, an {{important}} case in South African succession law, the testator had convinced {{his son to}} leave his job and take over the management and farming operations on the farm “Longridge” from him. To assist him, the testator bought another farm “Meldene” for his son (the son paid {{a small portion of}} this) to live on while managing Longridge. Because the son was finding it inconvenient and difficult to manage the farming operations on Longridge while living at Meldene the testator decided to sell 'Longridge' for a net price of £10,000 and undertook to give his son the sum of £262 which he calculated would be the amount of the selling agent's commission. The farm was sold and another smaller farm called “Patchwood” was purchased. In his will the testator had bequeathed Longridge to his two sons in equal shares. Thus when the testator died, his son claimed for his half share in the farm Patchwood. The claim <b>to</b> Patchwood <b>is</b> founded on a promise by the testator during his lifetime to donate to his son a farm to the value of at least £5,000. Alternatively, the son claimed that the bequest of a half-share of Longridge had not <b>been</b> <b>adeemed.</b> On the first argument, the court held that the testator had settled his promise by purchasing the farm Meldene for his son. Furthermore, the court held that the purchase of Patchwood <b>was</b> effected <b>to</b> replace the facilities for farming that his son would lose by the sale of Longridge, not that the farm was actually for him. On the second argument, the court rejected the contention that the testator felt obliged to sell the farm because his son was finding it difficult to manage it and it was thus not voluntary. The court held that involuntary alienations only arise out of necessity such as pressing debts. Thus the alienation was voluntary and the bequest had adeemed.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{during a}} trip to Portland, ME, rapper Sole {{convinced}} Adeem to attend Scribble Jam to perform with his group, The Live Poets. Adeem did not intend to participate in the emcee battle that year, but his friends registered him to compete anyway. After eliminating Atmosphere’s Slug in the final round, Adeem won the Emcee Battle—it was his first victory in an organized competition. The day after the battle, Mr. Dibbs expanded the 1200 Hobos DJ Crew <b>to</b> include emcees; <b>Adeem</b> <b>was</b> invited <b>to</b> the crew along with Buck 65, Sixtoo, Slug, Dose One, Eyedea, Adverse, Sole, and Alias.

5000|$|The {{internet}} {{also offers}} {{new opportunities for}} Muslim individuals to meet one another. In the past 10 years, Matchmaking sites for Muslims have become an increasingly popular way to meet one’s spouse. The website, SingleMuslim.com {{one of the first}} matchmaking sites <b>is</b> very successful. <b>Adeem</b> Younis, the founder of the website, designed it in accordance with Islamic principles. Halal sites like SingleMuslim.com ask questions about individuals’ piety including prayer habits, fasting, and if they have made the hajj pilgrimage. [...] Among Islamic theological figures there is some dispute over the validity of these websites; however, these sites continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> created and avidly used. According to Younis, “Because ‘dating’ is not allowed in Islam, the Internet is an ideal vehicle for a discreet first step in finding a marriage partner.” Websites such as, The International Muslim Matrimonial site, broaden the depth of choices for individuals looking for a partner. Individual interests like, hobbies, political views, things you are passionate about, activities you participate in, your family values, <b>are</b> all included <b>to</b> make a user profile. In some societies in both the Islamic world and the West, traditional matchmaking practices do not necessarily include this kind of expression of personal characteristics; therefore, these websites expand individuality while maintaining traditional Islamic ideals of matchmaking.|$|R
