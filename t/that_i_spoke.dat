He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|And {{the word}} of the Lord came to Solomon, saying: [...] "As for this house that you are building, if you will walk in My statutes, and execute My ordinances, and keep all My commandments, then I will {{establish}} My word with you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to David your father and I will dwell therein among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel." ...|$|E

"These {{words are}} {{explicit}} in my speech <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{at that time}} before the people, before all of the important officials {{who came to the}} celebration, and to the entire great crowd of thousands who came from the far ends of the Holy Land and from the lands of the Diaspora. So how can malicious people come to distort the words of the living G-d {{in a way that is}} so filled with wickedness and folly?..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All right, we'll go to <b>that</b> {{restaurant}} <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> about," [...] said Gif. [...] "Then we'll get our {{provisions and}} {{be on the way}} to the Lodge." ...|$|R

[...] The bad weather {{prevented}} me {{working on the}} spot and I’ve completely ruined it trying to finish it at home. [...] However I began again at once, the same subject on another canvas, but as the weather was quite different, in grey tones and without figures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geoff Boycott had now {{achieved}} {{his dream}} of becoming England captain, but {{failed to make the}} most of his opportunity in New Zealand. Although Barrington saw that the training facilities and grounds were poor compared to those in England he praised the New Zealanders for their efforts, but Boycott constantly complained and annoyed many locals who had worked hard to prepare for the England team's arrival. He became the first England captain to lose a Test to New Zealand when he put them in to bat in the First Test and saw England collapse to 64 all out in the last innings. Boycott made 1 and the other players resented his comments that they played like schoolboys. In the Second Test Barrington with the backing of the players told Boycott to declare so that England would have a chance of winning and by dismissing New Zealand for 105 they squared the series. The Third Test was drawn, but by arguing with Barrington in public and berating the New Zealand press corps Boycott made certain he would not be made England captain again. On their return to England Brearley soon resumed his role and Willis was made vice-captain; [...] "No manager worked harder on behalf of his players nor was better appreciated. Certainly no player on that tour <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to would dissent from this view".|$|E
6000|$|... "We need go no further, sirs; {{the house}} is clearly on fire, and smoke has made {{its way through the}} {{peephole}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{could see}} <b>that</b> he was interested, and <b>I</b> knew <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{he had looked}} {{through the window and}} seen the man writing the letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "How knowest thou that, oh stranger? How knowest thou <b>that</b> name? <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{it not to}} thee," [...] {{she broke}} in with a cry, {{catching}} at my arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "In giving <b>that</b> opinion, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> merely of his {{secondary}} or acquired habits," [...] interrupted Ergot; [...] "for, having {{reference to}} his original, the man is assuredly a White." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not know. It {{was only}} to-day <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to Major Prendergast about my {{troubles}} and was advised by {{him to come}} to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{but the one}} clue, then, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of, namely, {{the ring}} {{that belonged to the}} set of diamonds. Did your husband ever possess--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not ask}} as fearing <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> only of a {{dangerous}} habit. A paroxysm of spending money is apt to make one so uncomfortable. And then--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> night <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to Bickley {{about the}} matter, repeating exactly what had passed. As I expected, he smiled in his grave, rather sarcastic way, and made light of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I won’t tell it," [...] said Mr. Stiles. [...] "It wouldn’t {{be fair to}} you, Burton. I’d {{forgotten}} <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> <b>spoke.</b> Of course, {{you were}} young at the time, still——" ...|$|R
6000|$|And then {{occurred}} a {{thing so}} trivial {{and yet so}} terrible to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shiver now to think of <b>that</b> moment. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> aloud. <b>I</b> said, [...] "How the devil did I get here?" ... And the voice was not my own.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't forget <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{my heart}} to you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came {{to ask you about}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{time enough}} when I get you to your father," [...] said I, little {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> so true. [...] "I can tell him a fine tale of a loyal daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|I said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> English, and had {{not spoken}} {{anything}} else but rather poor French until six months before, and then she demanded, [...] "Have you been cast away on this outlandish place, too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you can't exactly {{call him}} <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>spoke</b> to him till jest before this thing happened. I want ter git him right out, on 'portant business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good," [...] he said; [...] "they are many, and {{the dust}} has told them all to me. Oh, they are very many"--and he glared around him--"so many <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> them all the hyenas of the hills would be full to-night--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No man, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> myself. <b>I</b> have {{lands in}} Spalding, by your Majesty's grace, and wish to enjoy them in peace, having {{worked for them}} hard enough--and how can <b>I</b> do <b>that,</b> as long as Hereward sits in Ely?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is {{not that}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> about," [...] her mother equivocated. [...] "Have you thought about him? He is so ineligible in every way, you know, and suppose he should come to love you?" ...|$|E
60|$|And quite suddenly, {{as if by}} inspiration, scarce {{knowing what}} I said or <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> at all, I {{answered}} {{her out of the}} store of the theological learning with which she had had me stuffed.|$|E
60|$|They say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> with a {{distinct}} enunciation, but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, not that. You {{may think}} it strange, but my {{sister-in-law}} and I {{are not so}} intimate as <b>that.</b> No; <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to my husband and my mother-in-law; I said I was sure we could do what we chose with you." ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of Too-Rye-Ays release, the album was often written up by the media as being a [...] "Van Morrison rip-off". Rowland later denied this and commented, [...] "They werent saying I was {{influenced}} by Van. They were saying it was a rip off. But <b>I</b> made <b>that</b> clear, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> about <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> covered one of his songs for gods sake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{as always}} you speak truth, Macumazahn," [...] said Goza, {{looking at me}} in a way which {{suggested}} to me <b>that</b> he believed <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> anything but the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Winifred," [...] he said, [...] "I {{must ask}} you a question. You {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to you of a document--Sinclair had it. I was {{trying to deal with}} him, trying to get it back for Mr. Deane here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] {{answered}} the priest, pausing in his walk and fixing his eyes upon the painter. [...] "It was {{to you as}} the friend of both <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of my love, and my hope--which is oftener my despair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your honour speaks ower truly in that," [...] said Jeanie; [...] "it was {{not with}} my will <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> wi' him just now, and--not to wish the gentleman onything but gude--I never wish to see him between the een again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How exquisitely you put it! Who {{else could}} have told me to mind my own {{business}} so delightfully? Well, it isn't my business. <b>I</b> acknowledge <b>that,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> only because <b>I</b> knew you would be sorry if you had gone too far. I remembered our promise to be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|He smiled <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>spoke.</b> [...] "Perhaps <b>I</b> {{deserved}} them, Lucy. If {{you don't}} respect me, I am {{sure it is}} because I am not respectable. I fear, I am an awkward fool: I must manage badly in some way, for where I wish to please, it seems I don't please." ...|$|R
60|$|Har. Jun. Sir, my father, I hope, has in part {{satisfied}} you, <b>that</b> what <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{was only}} an effect of sudden passion, of which I am now ashamed; and desire it may be no longer lodged in your remembrance, {{than it is now}} in my intention to do you any injury.|$|R
