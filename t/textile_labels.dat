40|$|Textile label {{information}} facilitates consumers' pre- and post-purchase decisions. Because consumers' knowledge {{regarding this}} information is relatively unexplored in a South African context, it {{was the focus of}} this exploratory descriptive study. A face-to-face survey was employed among respondents (n[*]=[*] 120) recruited at selected public locations in Potchefstroom, North-West Province, South Africa, according to predetermined inclusion criteria. The majority of respondents were able to correctly locate specific information (such as country of origin, size and fibre content; 75 %) and identify textile and care symbols (78 %) on the label, but were less knowledgeable about synthetic fibres (41 %) and certain care symbols (53 – 58 %). More educated, younger respondents speaking Eurocentric languages (Afrikaans and English) appeared to be more knowledgeable about textile label information than respondents speaking an African language. Even though respondents had excellent label knowledge in most instances, a lack of practical application of this knowledge was evident in their reading of care labels pre- and post-purchase, as well as in their use of <b>textile</b> <b>labels</b> to make purchasing decisions.

40|$|China {{has ever}} had the largest textile higher {{education}} in the world. However the scale has been decreasing since the late 1990 s. The removal of the <b>textile</b> <b>labels</b> from the textile-specialised higher institutions reveals a general diminishing trend of specialised higher education in China over the reform period. This article aims to explore the reasons behind the changes in textile {{higher education in the}} broader context of educational administration. The Communist China runs a hugh bureaucracy that is characterised by centralised planning and administrative control of much of the nation's economic activities. As part of the bureaucracy, the higher education structure was largely determined by the administrative system. The establishment of the central ministerial management system legitimated the existence of the 'textile system' accommodating the specialised higher education institutions. Structural reform in higher education, especially the introduction of 'de-sectorisation', since the mid- 1980 s has significant effect in changing the relationship of the textile-specialised higher education institutions with the other actors (such as the state and enterprises) and eventually redefining their academic identities.

40|$|The textile and {{clothing}} sector constitutes a major segment in the European manufacturing industry and plays {{an essential role}} in the EU economy as such and in the social welfare of its consumers. The development of new applications of textile fibres and products demonstrate the need for uniform legal acts within the EU regarding to textile labelling. The textile labelling area covers the specific disclosure of information on fibre composition; care-instructions; chemical substances; corporate social responsibility production; sizing; country of origin etcetera. Over the years, the EU has developed a wide body of consumer protection law. This encompasses policy instruments designed {{to ensure the safety of}} products placed on the consumer market and to protect consumers from unfair commercial practices, as well as instruments which seek to guarantee that consumers are provided with clear and correct information before they enter into a contract. Conveying accurate information on labels can limit the scope of misleading or even fraudulent marketing of goods by the industry. In view of the studies carried out on behalf of the Commission and the stakeholder consultations mentioned above, and despite the applicable general and specific rules on labelling on an EU level, it is doubtful whether these rules in fact protect EU consumers. This leads to the following main question: To what extent does European consumer policy protect consumers against inaccurate or misleading information on textile & clothing labels? This research assesses whether the Textile Regulation, self-regulatory instruments and/or horizontal legislation together adequately safeguard consumers against inaccurate or misleading information on <b>textile</b> <b>labels.</b> The assessment includes the labelling policy of the T&C industry that operates within the European consumer market...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Background and motivation: Consumers {{are faced}} with choices of textile {{products}} on the market every day, and it should be determined whether labels, being a major source of information at the point of sale, assist consumers in their decision making. Regarding the concept of labelling, the nature of a typical textile label was defined and the information to be included in a label was identified as the size of the product, care instructions, fibre content, country of origin, name of the manufacturer and the brand name. It was discovered from literature that consumer behaviour is influenced by the external factors and determined by the internal factors such as personality and self-concept, attitudes, perceptions, motivation and involvement, memory and learning and emotions. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore consumers' awareness and perceptions of textile product labelling and to determine the extent to which the consumers use the information on the textile product label when making decisions on or purchasing textile goods. Methodology: As very little is known about this phenomenon regarding the South African consumer, a qualitative, explorative, descriptive research strategy was followed. Focus groups were used for data collection and participants were selected by purposive sampling so that only the knowledgeable consumer with reference to the textile label was included. The research was made trustworthy by using the purposive sampling, and conducting a pilot test before data collection. In addition, peers and study leaders monitored all the processes of the research. Data were analysed using a qualitative thematic research analysis method. Identified themes and concepts were then discussed under the pre-determined categories of awareness, perceptions and the influence each of these themes has on the decision-making process when purchasing textile products. Results and discussions: The results revealed that the consumers were very aware of the existence of a label, they were even able to define it, and they could identify it in a number of ways. Consumers were also aware of the type of information provided by the textile product labels. The perceptions that the consumers have about the information found on the label and the nature of the label are discussed at length in the text. It was discovered that <b>textile</b> <b>labels</b> do influence the decision-making process of the consumers when purchasing textile products and the information on size is the most important to consumers.

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Textile product {{labels are}} {{provided}} on the clothing and household textile products to assist consumers with important product information. However, the assumption cannot {{be made that}} because the label is available on these products {{it will be used}} by consumers. Consumers do not base their pre– and post–purchasing decisions on reality but rather on what they perceive to be the reality. Thus consumers’ perceptions of textile product labels need to be studied as it influences their pre– and post–purchasing decisions and use of these labels. Consumers use their perceptions as a frame of reference for making purchasing decisions. This study determined consumers’ perceptions, in order to form a better understanding of their textile pre– and post–purchasing decisions. However, perception is not a singular concept but an interactive process. Therefore, the present study, done in the Gauteng Province, aimed to determine consumers’ perceptions of clothing and household <b>textile</b> <b>labels,</b> by focusing on the perceptual process of consumers. The first objective was to determine consumers’ awareness of labels on clothing and household textile products. Secondly, it was determined whether consumers’ attention is drawn to labels of clothing and household textile products. Thirdly it was determined whether labels on textile products are important to consumers and finally, whether consumers interpret labels on textile products. An interviewer–administered questionnaire was used as the data collection technique. A total of 411 questionnaires were administered by trained fieldworkers. The study location was three different regions in Gauteng Province, namely: Pretoria, Vereeniging and the West Rand. Public locations were used for the recruitment of respondents selected within the three regions, which included: schools, retirement villages, parking areas and government institutions. This contributed to the probability that a diverse group of respondents participated. The study population consisted of 44. 5 % males and 55. 5 % females. The home languages most spoken among the respondents were English (20. 9 %), Afrikaans (21. 1 %) or isiZulu (16. 5 %). Respondents generally tended to have a positive perception regarding textile product labels. The results illustrated that respondents tended to agree to be aware of label information and that the front and back panels of the label draw their attention. However respondents tended to be neutral as to whether the information is important enough to read. Respondents mostly agreed that they interpret the symbols on textile product labels. Although respondents tended to perceive textile product labels positively, it still remains unclear whether it is important enough for consumers to use these labels found on textile products. By striving to improve consumers’ perceptions regarding textile product labels through better labelling initiatives and consumer education on labels, consumers might view labels as important and use them before and after purchasing a textile product. This will in effect teach consumers how to clean and maintain textile products to extend the product’s lifespan. This would in turn contribute to the consumer’s pre– and post–purchasing satisfaction. This study additionally found that respondents’ perceptions of textile product labels were influenced by some of their demographic characteristics. Although there were no large effect sizes which illustrated practical significance, there were some small to medium tendencies regarding respondents’ perceptions of textile product labels and their demographic characteristics. Different tendencies were especially found when analysing the relationships between respondents’ perceptions and age or language. Older respondents (60 and older) tended to have a more positive perception of textile product labels than younger respondents (18 to 29 years). In addition, respondents with an African language as their home language seemed to differ from Afrikaans and English respondents. To understand South African consumers fully, researchers should understand the diversity and political history of South Africa, by focusing on cultural differences and reasons thereof. Different age generations need to be examined in further South African studies {{in order to determine the}} perceptions of consumers from different age groups regarding textile product labels.

Considering the probable acceptance of the novel fibre in Europe, this method is needed for consumer protection to allow market surveillance and antifraud controls. The aim {{of the study was}} to extend the scope of application of method 11 of Directive 96 / 73 /EC, based on the selective dissolution of one of the components in binary mixtures. The method foresaw sample treatment with 75 % m/m sulfuric acid at room temperature for a contact time of 1 h. In order to ensure accurate quantification of the blends under investigation, the washing procedure had to be modified with the addition of two rinsings of the residue with the reagent used for the dissolution. Following ISO 5725, a balanced uniform level test was performed on loop twisted carpet samples of three levels of concentration (25, 50 and 75 %, approximately) with the participation of seventeen European laboratories. The trueness was evaluated considering as reference values data obtained from manual separation of samples. The calculated bias varied from 0. 06 to 0. 49 %, rising with the increasing content of polyamide in the binary mixture. Repeatability and reproducibility limits were in the range 0. 69 - 1. 04 % and 0. 97 - 1. 87 %, respectively.
