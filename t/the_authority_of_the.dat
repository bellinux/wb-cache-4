5|$|Lugal: {{while in}} Mesopotamia a lugal {{designated}} a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was directly under <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital. The {{nature of this}} title as part of Eblaite bureaucracy is ambiguous; each lugal was under <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grand vizier, and the bearers ruled cities directly under <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital and they all brought goods {{to be kept in}} Ebla's storehouses. Pettinato counted 14 different lugals in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; two of them in the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A less {{contentious}} standoff {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey.

5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. It is open to question whether <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property {{of those who died}} without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. <b>The</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E
