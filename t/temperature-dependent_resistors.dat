40|$|Abstract—Although many {{attempts}} have been made to design a fault-current limiting (FCL) circuit breaker (FCLCB) for medium voltage electric power systems, no economically attractive solu-tion has been achieved so far. In this paper, a novel concept for a FCLCB is introduced based on a hybrid arrangement of semi-conductors, <b>temperature-dependent</b> <b>resistors,</b> and a newly devel-oped fast-opening mechanical switch. The latter utilizes one part of an electrodynamic repulsion drive, which is concurrent with the moving double-contact system. Laboratory tests as well as com-puter simulations of the complete FCLCB verify, as an example, the feasibility for the goal ratings 12 kV and 2 / 20 kA (single phase). A cost analysis shows the FCLCB to be more expensive than a con-ventional generator CB, but to be in the price range of the Is-limiter and below the costs of superconducting FCL principles. It is con-cluded that the presented method provides the basis for further commercial product development.

5000|$|It was a low-distortion audio {{oscillator}} used for testing sound equipment. It used the Wien bridge oscillator circuit, {{that had been}} the subject of Bill Hewlett's Masters thesis. It was also the first such commercial oscillator to use a simple light bulb as the <b>temperature-dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> in its feedback network. The light bulb was an inexpensive and effective automatic gain control that not only kept the oscillator output amplitude constant, but it also kept the oscillator's loop gain near unity. The latter is a key technique for achieving a low distortion oscillator. Earlier, Meacham had used light bulbs in bridge circuits to stabilize and linearize oscillators in 1938.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel `spirit level' sensor derived from a well known thermal flow sensor. The {{operation}} principle {{is based on the}} temperature difference of two identical heaters, caused by buoyancy of air. Heating as well as temperature sensing of the structures is carried out using <b>temperature-dependent</b> platinum <b>resistors.</b> Due to its simplicity the sensor is easily fabricated in silicon micro-machining technology. The theory describing the sensor is presented. The first experiments, using dc signals only, show adequate sensitivity, although high-accuracy operation is hampered by thermal drift...|$|R
