5|$|In 2008 Hattner {{was chosen}} from {{a field of}} 112 {{candidates}} to be the conductor and {{music director of the}} Portland Youth Philharmonic. In April 2010 <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> was awarded the Oregon Symphony's Patty Vemer Excellence in Music Education Award, marking the first time the recognition for inspiring students was presented to an organization. Hattner accepted the award on the orchestra's behalf. In order to make use of all musicians in <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> as often as possible, Hattner often uses Romantic music and symphonies and ballets from the early 20th century in his programs. <b>The</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> began offering chamber orchestra concerts during his tenure.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} the scholarship of countess Erna Hamilton in 1993. In 1994, as an organ soloist, {{he won the}} Danish qualification rounds and national final of the Eurovision Young Musicians competition. He was one of eight winners of the 24 national competitions that year to be selected for the European final, held at <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Concert Hall in Warsaw, Poland on 14 June 1994. He performed Francis Poulenc's Organ Concerto, but was not placed in the top 3. The Polish organizers originally planned the qualifying round to be held elsewhere, but moved it to <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Hall (which contains a pipe organ) to accommodate Magle's participation.|$|E

5|$|Barbirolli {{returned}} to New York {{to complete his}} contractual obligations to <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic.</b> Shortly after his return he received an appeal from the Hallé Orchestra to become its conductor. The orchestra {{was in danger of}} extinction for lack of players, and Barbirolli seized the opportunity to help it.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} clarinet {{with and}} guest conducting several major ensembles, Hattner moved to New York City in 1996 and became principal clarinetist of the Princeton Symphony Orchestra; his Lincoln Center debut occurred later that year. By 2002 Hattner was the music director and clarinetist of Camerata Atlantica. In 2008 {{he was chosen}} to be the conductor and {{music director of the}} Portland Youth Philharmonic. Since joining <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> he has debuted with the Oregon Symphony, Oregon Mozart Players and continues to perform clarinet for local ensembles and other projects. Hattner has also participated in multimedia work with silent film both nationally and internationally.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{received}} honorary {{degrees from}} the universities of Cambridge (1867) and Oxford (1870). <b>The</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society awarded him its Beethoven gold medal in 1867. In 1871 he was knighted by Queen Victoria (two years after his old antagonist Costa had been accorded the same honour), and in 1872 he received a public testimonial before a large audience at St James's Hall, London. The money subscribed at this event founded a scholarship and prize at the RAM, which is still awarded. An English Heritage blue plaque has been placed at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace, London, where Bennett lived during many of his later years.|$|E
5|$|From {{the autumn}} of 1894, the hall was adopted as the venue for the annual winter season of concerts of <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society of London, which had {{formerly}} been held at St James's Hall. At the first Philharmonic concert at the Queen's Hall, Alexander Mackenzie conducted the first performance in England of Tchaikovsky's Pathétique Symphony, which was so well received that it was repeated, by popular acclaim, at the next concert. During the 1894–95 season, Edvard Grieg and Camille Saint-Saëns conducted performances of their works. The Society remained at the Queen's Hall until 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 1837 Bennett {{began to}} teach at the RAM, with which he was {{associated}} {{for most of the}} rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at Queen's College, London. Amongst his pupils during this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor Michael Costa.|$|E
50|$|He has {{performed}} as a soloist with orchestras including <b>the</b> New York <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Orchestra, <b>the</b> Royal <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> New World Symphony, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. He has also conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, <b>the</b> Royal <b>Philharmonic,</b> Germany’s NDR Symphony Orchestra and the Berlin Symphoniker, <b>the</b> Beijing <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Euro-Asia <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Shanghai Symphony, <b>the</b> Bogotá <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Sinfonietta, the Orquesta de Baja California, the Santa Barbara Symphony, the San Diego Symphony and the San Diego Chamber Orchestra, among others. He has made highly acclaimed recordings for Delos International, RCA Victor Red Seal and RCA Victor Worldwide, Telarc and Angel/EMI (Angel/EMI recordings produced by Patti Laursen).|$|R
50|$|Menuhin {{has played}} with <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Royal <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> English Chamber Orchestra, <b>the</b> Vienna <b>Philharmonic,</b> and <b>the</b> Tonhalle among others. His {{recording}} of Bartok's Sonatas for violin and piano with his father, Yehudi Menuhin, {{was awarded the}} 'Grand prix du Disque'.|$|R
50|$|He has {{conducted}} many leading orchestras around the world, including <b>the</b> Royal <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> London <b>Philharmonic,</b> BBC Philharmonic, RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra, and <b>the</b> Czech <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra. He is currently Associate Conductor of <b>the</b> Royal <b>Philharmonic</b> Concert Orchestra, a post {{he has held}} for more than 12 years.|$|R
5|$|In June 1853 Bennett {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} as a soloist with orchestra {{in his own}} Fourth Piano Concerto. This performance was given with a new organization, the Orchestral Union, and followed a snub from Costa, who had refused to conduct the pianist Arabella Goddard (Davison's wife) in Bennett's Third Concerto at <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society. In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was greatly tempted by the offer, but felt it his duty to remain in England, as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils, and he refused to let them down. After the controversial 1855 season of <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society at which Richard Wagner conducted, Bennett was elected {{to take over the}} conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for ten years. At his first concert, on 14 April 1856, the piano soloist in Beethoven's Emperor Concerto was Clara Schumann, wife of his old friend. It was her first appearance in England.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Montague Haltrecht {{suggests}} that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext to abandon <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> {{in favour of}} Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged {{that he had had}} a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> was unequal to the difficulties of the score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E
50|$|Chang has {{performed}} with <b>the</b> New York <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Boston Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Montréal Symphony Orchestra, <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Vienna <b>Philharmonic,</b> orchestras in London, England, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Additionally, she {{has performed}} with <b>the</b> Los Angeles <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> NHK Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo, <b>the</b> Hong Kong <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, <b>the</b> Bayerische Rundfunk Orchestra, the Washington National Symphony Orchestra, <b>the</b> Oslo <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Melbourne Symphony, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Orchestre Philharmonique de Luxembourg, the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre National de France, the Honolulu Symphony, and <b>the</b> Netherlands Radio <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra amongst others.|$|R

He has also recorded works by Balakirev, Prokofiev and Rachmaninoff.|$|R
50|$|He {{has given}} {{recitals}} {{all over the}} world and has been featured as soloist with such orchestras as the Baltimore, Indianapolis, New Jersey, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Florida, West Virginia, Illinois, Flagstaff, Macon, Augusta, Greenville, Charleston, New York City and Jupiter Symphonies, the Symphony of the Americas, the National Chamber Orchestra, the Illinois Chamber Orchestra, the American Chamber Orchestra, <b>the</b> Hudson Valley <b>Philharmonic,</b> Sinfonia da Camara, South Carolina Philharmonic, Florida Virtuosi Orchestra, the Puerto Rico Symphony, <b>the</b> Montevideo <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Lviv <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Moscow <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Janáček <b>Philharmonic</b> in <b>the</b> Czech Republic, and the national orchestras of Ukraine, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Colombia.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} positive {{reviews for}} his pianism, Bache's difficulties with the critics {{on behalf of}} Liszt's music had a negative backlash on his performing career. He was never invited to play with <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society, even after Liszt personally recommended him as a soloist. After printed inquiries by the Musical Standard, which openly questioned why Bache's career had not advanced despite his obvious talent, he was invited in 1874 {{to play at the}} Crystal Palace. While his playing was lauded, his choice of music (the Liszt arrangement of Weber's Polonaise Brillante for piano and orchestra) was derided as astoundingly impudent. He also appeared at concerts led by Hans Richter, as organist in Liszt's symphonic poem Die Hunnenschlacht and as pianist in Beethoven's Choral Fantasy and Chopin's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Heliade began {{a career}} as a civil servant after the Postelnicie {{commissioned}} him to print the Official Bulletin, and later climbed through the official hierarchy, eventually serving as Clucer. This rise coincided with the establishment of the Regulamentul Organic regime, inaugurated, upon the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, by an Imperial Russian administration under Pavel Kiselyov. When Kiselyov placed an order with Heliade for the printing of official documents, including the Regulament, the writer and his family were made prosperous by the sales. Nevertheless, Heliade maintained contacts with the faction of reformist boyars: in 1833, together with Ion Câmpineanu, Iancu Văcărescu, Ioan Voinescu II, Constantin Aristia, Ştefan and Nicolae Golescu, as well as others, he founded the short-lived Soţietatea Filarmonică (<b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society), which advanced a cultural agenda (and was especially active in raising funds for the National Theater of Wallachia). Aside from its stated cultural goals, Soţietatea Filarmonică continued a covert political activity.|$|E
5|$|Many {{events at}} the Queen's Hall were not {{presented}} by Newman. The hall was frequently let to organisations such as the Bach Choir and <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society (from 1903 the Royal Philharmonic Society), and later the London Choral Society and Royal Choral Society. The hall was used {{for a wide range}} of other activities, including balls, military band concerts under Sousa, lectures, public meetings, Morris dancing, Eurythmics and religious services. On 14 January 1896, the UK's first public film show was presented at the Queen's Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society by the maker of the Kineopticon and Fellow of the society, Birt Acres, and his colleague, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. This was an improved version of the early Kinetoscope.|$|E
50|$|He has {{appeared}} in recital as well as soloist with orchestras such as <b>the</b> London <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, <b>the</b> Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden, <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, <b>the</b> Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra, <b>the</b> Dresden <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, <b>the</b> Zurich Chamber Orchestra, the Bamberger Symphoniker, the Hallé Orchestra Manchester, the Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra, the Dresdner Sinfoniker, the London Mozart Players, the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra, the Miami Symphony Orchestra, <b>the</b> Slovenian <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, <b>the</b> Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, <b>the</b> Zagreb <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, <b>the</b> Belgrade <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra and <b>the</b> Berliner Sinfonie Orchester.|$|R

5|$|The two Danubian Principalities, Wallachia and Moldavia, {{came under}} direct Russian {{supervision}} upon {{the close of}} the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, being subsequently administered on the basis of common documents, known as Regulamentul Organic. After a period of Russian military occupation, Wallachia returned to Ottoman suzerainty while Russian oversight was preserved, and the throne was awarded to Alexandru II Ghica in 1834—this measure was controversial from the onset, given that, despite the popular provisions of the Akkerman Convention, Ghica had been appointed by Russia and the Ottomans, instead of being elected by the Wallachian Assembly. As a consequence, the Prince was faced with opposition {{from both sides of the}} political spectrum, while also attempting to quell the peasantry's discontent by legislating against the abuse of estate lessors. The first liberal movement, taking inspiration from the French Revolution and having for its stated purpose the encouragement of culture, was Societatea Filarmonică (<b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Society), established in 1833.|$|E
5|$|Barbirolli's first {{concert in}} New York was on 5 November 1936. The {{programme}} consisted of short pieces by Berlioz and Arnold Bax, and symphonies by Mozart (the Linz) and Brahms (the Fourth). During his ten weeks, he programmed several American novelties including Charles Martin Loeffler's tone-poem Memories of My Childhood, a symphony by Anis Fuleihan, and Philip James's Bret Harte overture. He also conducted Serge Koussevitzky's Double Bass Concerto. The players told <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> management {{that they would}} be happy for Barbirolli to be appointed to a permanent position. The outcome of this was an invitation to him to become Music Director and Permanent Conductor for three years starting with the 1937–38 season. At the same time as this great change in his professional life, Barbirolli's personal life was also transformed. His marriage had not lasted; within four years he and Marjorie Barbirolli had been living apart. In 1938 she sued for divorce on the grounds of his desertion. The suit was undefended, and the divorce was granted in December 1938. In 1939, Barbirolli married the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell. The marriage lasted for the rest of Barbirolli's life.|$|E
5|$|When Richter {{resigned}} {{as head of}} the Vienna Philharmonic subscription concerts in September 1898, the concerts committee had unanimously chosen Mahler as his successor. The appointment was not universally welcomed; the anti-Semitic press wondered if, as a non-German, Mahler would be capable of defending German music. Attendances rose sharply in Mahler's first season, but members of the orchestra were particularly resentful of his habit of re-scoring acknowledged masterpieces, and of his scheduling of extra rehearsals for works with which they were thoroughly familiar. An attempt by the orchestra to have Richter reinstated for the 1899 season failed, because Richter was not interested. Mahler's position was weakened when, in 1900, he took the orchestra to Paris to play at the Exposition Universelle. The Paris concerts were poorly attended and lost money—Mahler had to borrow the orchestra's fare home from the Rothschilds. In April 1901, dogged by a recurrence of ill-health and wearied by more complaints from the orchestra, Mahler relinquished <b>the</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> concerts conductorship. In his three seasons he had performed around 80 different works, which included pieces by relatively unknown composers such as Hermann Goetz, Wilhelm Kienzl and the Italian Lorenzo Perosi.|$|E
50|$|Smirnova {{has played}} under such notable {{conductors}} as Ivor Bolton, Andrey Boreyko, Manfred Honeck, Carlos Kalmar, Lev Markiz, Andres Mustonen, or John Storgårds, {{and with such}} orchestras as the Weimar State Kapelle, the German Chamber Academy of Neuss, <b>the</b> Jena <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Halle State Orchestra, the Georgian Chamber Orchestra Ingol City, <b>the</b> Wuerttemberg <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Salzburg Chamber Soloists, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Tonkunstler Orchestra of Lower Austria, the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, the Beethoven Academy Orchestra, the Varsovia Symphony, <b>the</b> Zagreb <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, <b>the</b> RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra, <b>the</b> Belgrade <b>Philharmonic,</b> <b>the</b> Breslau <b>Philharmonic</b> W.
