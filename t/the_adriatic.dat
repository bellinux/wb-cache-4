40|$|An updated climatology, {{based on}} a {{comprehensive}} data set (1911 – 2009) of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen, has been produced for <b>the</b> whole <b>Adriatic</b> Sea with <b>the</b> variational inverse method using the DIVA (Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis) software. Climatological maps were produced at 26 levels and validated with ordinary cross-validation and with a real vs. synthetic temperature–salinity diagram intercomparison. The concept of climatology–observation misfit (COM) has been introduced as {{an estimate of the}} physical variability associated with the climatological structures. In order to verify the temporal stability of the climatology, long-term variability has been investigated in <b>the</b> Middle <b>Adriatic</b> and <b>the</b> South <b>Adriatic</b> pits, regarded as the most suitable records of possible long-term changes. Compared with previous climatologies, this study allows a clear identification of the seasonal dynamic of <b>the</b> southern <b>Adriatic,</b> where a clear oxygen minimum is typically observed in the centre of <b>the</b> South <b>Adriatic</b> Gyre. New and better resolved features emerged from this analysis: (1) below 100 m all properties profoundly differ between the central and <b>the</b> southern <b>Adriatic</b> and seem characterized by different biogeochemical dynamics; (2) <b>the</b> South <b>Adriatic</b> Pit clearly shows the remote effects of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient, while no effect is observed in <b>the</b> Middle <b>Adriatic</b> Pit; (3) <b>the</b> deepest part of <b>the</b> southern <b>Adriatic</b> seems now to be significantly saltier (+ 0. 18 psu since the period 1910 – 1914, with an increase of + 0. 018 decade − 1 since the late 1940 s) and warmer (+ 0. 54 °C since 1910 – 1914) even though a long-term temperature trend could not be statistically demonstrated; (4) <b>the</b> Middle <b>Adriatic</b> Pit shows a long-term increase in apparent oxygen utilization (+ 0. 77 mL L − 1 since 1910 – 1914, with a constant increase of + 0. 2 mL L − 1 decade − 1 after the 1970 s) ...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Adriatic</b> Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic,</b> with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic,</b> designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified as native to <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic,</b> many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the War of the Fifth Coalition in late 1809 had changed the political situation in <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic,</b> confirming French possession of the Illyrian Provinces and removing any threat to <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> seaports from Austrian-held territory. It also freed the French Army to operate against the Ottoman Empire, as intended in the Treaty of Tilsit.

5|$|By {{the time}} this ship, Rivoli, was launched, the Royal Navy had {{achieved}} dominance over the French in <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> Sea. Not only had the regional commander Bernard Dubourdieu been killed and his squadron destroyed at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, but French efforts to supply their scattered garrisons were proving increasingly risky. This was demonstrated by {{the destruction of a}} well-armed convoy from Corfu to Trieste at the Action of 29 November 1811. Rivoli's launch was therefore seen by the French Navy as an opportunity to reverse these defeats, as the new ship of the line outgunned the British frigates that operated within <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> and would be able to operate in <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> without the threat of attack by the frigate squadron based on Lissa.|$|E

Command of <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> partially rested on control of the Ionian Islands, which lie outside the Straits of Otranto but could be used to blockade the passage if properly garrisoned. To this end, the French heavily fortified the island of Corfu, but were unable to consistently maintain an effective naval squadron to dispute British operations in <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic.</b> Exploiting French weakness at sea, British cruisers were able to defeat successive French squadrons sent to reinforce the region and exerted total dominance in <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> and Ionian seas.|$|E
