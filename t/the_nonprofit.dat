50|$|In 2012, Cressman led efforts {{resulting}} in the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) penalizing two Arizona-based nonprofits, Americans for Responsible Leadership and the Center to Protect Patient Rights. <b>The</b> <b>nonprofits</b> donated $11 million dollars to oppose the California governor Jerry Brown's tax hike, Proposition 30, and they proposed a labor organizing reform, Proposition 32. Cressman filed the complaint with the FPPC to reveal {{the names of the}} donors who had contributed the money to <b>the</b> <b>nonprofits</b> and proposed to defeat Brown’s proposals. After an investigation by the FPPC, one of <b>the</b> <b>nonprofits</b> involved was linked to Republican billionaire donors, David Koch and Charles Koch.

5|$|The Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{occurred}} {{only weeks}} after the building was completed. At that time more than 80% of the apartments were rented and some 300 students had signed up to take classes at the Institute. However, both rentals and student fees were soon depleted, and <b>the</b> <b>nonprofit</b> corporation that ran the building was unable to meet its payments. On April 6, 1932, this organization was sued for nonpayment of taxes and sinking fund payments due on the mortgage bonds. At {{that time it was}} alleged that the building was being mismanaged, the principal evidence offered being the provision of free living quarters to the Roeriches and their followers. Horch successfully contested the suit partly on a technicality and partly by explaining that the 20 rooms occupied rent-free were used by management as partial compensation to employees of the corporation. Representatives of the bond holders had argued that the parts of the building that did not produce rental income—that is the museum, institute, and other cultural spaces—should be converted to apartments but Horch successfully countered that the museum et al. were an asset that generated a substantial tax exemption and that, in normal times, they led to higher rental rates from the existing apartments than would comparable apartments. He also pointed out that the demanded conversion would be expensive (about $100,000). In June 1932, the foreclosure case ended with Horch being named one of two receivers tasked with clearing the building's debts.|$|E
