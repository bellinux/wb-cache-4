5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide orogeny and the {{creation}} of the Basin and Range province worked together to steepen the gradient of streams flowing west on the Colorado Plateau.

5|$|After {{crossing}} the city line, I-496 turns southward and merges with US127. The two highways run concurrently, and they cross {{a line of}} the Canadian National Railway. The freeway runs along <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus of Michigan State University. South of campus, I-496/US127 crosses back into Lansing and has an interchange with Jolly Road before entering Delhi Township.

5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub {{that grows}} {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the state, near <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among coastal heath on cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the estate}} {{had been broken}} up into fifteen smaller farms. The rough {{northern}} meadows adjacent to the Moselle were used for beef farming, whilst the southern fields, known as Grainger's Farm, were used as grazing land. <b>The</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate was by this time occupied by the Great Eastern Railway's Palace Gates Line and Green Lanes railway station, opened in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Fleet Street {{is named}} after the River Fleet, which runs from Hampstead to the River Thames at <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City of London.

5|$|Goat Rocks is an extinct {{stratovolcano}} in the Cascade Range, {{located between}} Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in southern Washington, in the United States. Part of the Cascade Volcanoes, it {{was formed by}} the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American Plate. The volcano was active from 3.2 million years ago until eruptions ceased between 1 and 0.5 million years ago. Throughout its complex eruptive history, volcanism shifted from silicic explosive eruptions to voluminous, mafic activity.|$|E
5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American {{continent}} {{was pushed}} against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone. A subduction zone {{is a type}} of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E
5|$|It {{proceeded}} to drop {{large amounts of}} hail on the northern beach suburbs of Mona Vale and Palm Beach around 8:50pm, and {{the centre of the}} storm again crossed the coast and back out to sea just after 9:00pm. The storm maintained its intensity, however, and continued to move in a northwesterly direction across Broken Bay. <b>The</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm had a minor impact on southern suburbs of the Central Coast between 9:15pm and 9:30pm.|$|E

The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone. The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled moat; now a garden, the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself.|$|E
5|$|The geology of {{the town}} {{comprises}} bedrock formed in the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, overlain in places by more recent Quaternary drift deposits. The bedrock is chalk of various formations. The drift deposits comprise a cap of clay-with-flints on <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town around Poundbury, alluvium in the river's floodplain, and several narrow ribbons of poorly stratified head deposits, found particularly around the town's northeastern and southwestern boundaries but also elsewhere.|$|E

The route continues on, passing through the hamlets of Bolton and Bolton Landing, the latter of which is home to The Sagamore, a resort situated on an island in Lake George.|$|E
5|$|Banksia epica {{is known}} only from two {{population}}s in eastern {{parts of the}} Esperance Plains region of the South West Botanical Province, near <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Australian Bight. The main population occurs about 30 kilometres (20mi) west of Point Culver; there were over 2000 plants there when surveyed in June 1989. A smaller population occurs about 70 kilometres (45mi) further east at Toolinna Cove; when surveyed in August 1991, this locality had around 350 plants. This latter population represents the easternmost limit of the western Banksia species; east of Toolinna Cove no Banksia species occurs for over 900 kilometres (550mi).|$|E
5|$|In Dix, NY414 makes a large reverse S-curve, {{turning to}} the east and {{northeast}} as it follows the Corning Secondary through another creek valley, this one surrounding Shequaga Creek. The creek eventually heads east toward Montour Falls; however, NY414 and the rail line continue northeast to the outskirts of Watkins Glen, a village located inside of a wide valley holding Seneca Lake. At <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gully, the Corning Secondary breaks from NY414 to follow the ridge north through Watkins Glen State Park. The route, meanwhile, descends the side of the valley to enter Watkins Glen, where it merges with NY14 {{at the foot of the}} hill.|$|E
