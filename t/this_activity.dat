5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators.

5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. <b>This</b> <b>activity</b> increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E

40|$|Preparations of enzymically {{dispersed}} rat pancreatic cells hydrolyse {{externally added}} nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates at high {{rates in the}} presence of Mg 2 + or Ca 2 +. The lack of response to specific inhibitors and activators differentiates <b>this</b> hydrolytic <b>activity</b> from that of other well-characterized ion-transporting ATPases. Studies based on inactivation of <b>this</b> hydrolytic <b>activity</b> by the covalently reacting, slowly permeating probe diazotized sulphanilic acid indicated that this nucleoside tri- and di-phosphatase is primarily a plasma-membrane ecto-enzyme. It is the major ATPase activity associated with intact cells, homogenates and isolated plasma-membrane fractions. Concanavalin A stimulates <b>this</b> ATPase <b>activity</b> of intact cells and isolated plasma-membrane fractions. The insensitivity of <b>this</b> ATPase <b>activity</b> to univalent ions and inhibitors of pancreatic electrolyte secretion, taken together with the evidence that the active site is externally located, suggests that this enzyme is not directly involved in HCO 3 - secretion in the pancreas. Its actual function remains unknown...|$|R

The Berlin Committee offered money, arms, and military advisors according to plans made by the German Foreign Office and Indian revolutionaries-in-exile such {{as members of the}} Ghadar Party in North America. The planners hoped to trigger a nationalist rebellion using clandestine shipments of men and arms sent to India from elsewhere in Asia and from the United States.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by <b>this</b> <b>activity</b> becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses <b>this</b> <b>activity</b> as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
