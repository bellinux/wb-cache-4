5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> point is a saturation point. When <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point determines the specific humidity of the air. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Portland was {{selected}} as one of five cities in the U.S. to host <b>the</b> <b>Dew</b> Action Sports Tour, a new extreme sports franchise to start in 2005. Titled the Vans Invitational, the event {{was held at the}} Rose Quarter from August 17–21. The Rose Quarter hosted BMX: Dirt and Freestyle Motocross. <b>The</b> <b>Dew</b> Action Sports will return to Portland for a third year.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
25|$|But {{with the}} {{exception}} of the Book of Arda Wiraz, <b>the</b> <b>dews</b> are not generally described as a force to be feared. With fundamental optimism, the texts describe how <b>the</b> <b>dews</b> may be kept in check, ranging from cursing them to the active participation in life through good thoughts, words and deeds. Many of the medieval texts develop ideas already expressed in the Vendidad ("given against the demons").|$|R
2500|$|Also {{mirroring}} Ormuzd's act of creation, i.e., {{the realization}} of the Amesha Spentas by his [...] "thought", is Ahriman's creation of <b>the</b> <b>dews</b> through his [...] "demonic essence." [...] Other texts describe this event as being to Ahriman's detriment for his act of [...] "creation" [...] is actually an act of destruction. Ahriman is the very epitome (and hypostasis) of destruction, and hence he did not [...] "create" [...] the demons, he realized them through destruction, and they then became that destruction. The consequence is that, as Ahriman and <b>the</b> <b>dews</b> can only destruct, they will ultimately destroy themselves (Denkard 3). As the medieval texts also do for Ahriman, they question whether <b>the</b> <b>dews</b> exist at all. Since [...] "existence" [...] is the domain of Ormuzd, and Ahriman and his dews are anti-existence, it followed that Ahriman and his dews could not possibly exist. One interpretation of the Denkard proposes that <b>the</b> <b>dews</b> were perceived to be non-existent physically (that is, they were considered non-ontological) but present psychologically.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{chemical}} reactions have {{water as a}} product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point local condensation will occur.

25|$|Water vapor {{will only}} {{condense}} onto another surface when that surface is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point temperature, {{or when the}} water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded. When water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, {{the temperature of the}} atmosphere drops slightly. In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei). <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> point of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a type of water or rain.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the advent}} of ICBMs created another attack {{scenario}} that <b>the</b> <b>DEW</b> Line could not defend against, in 1958 the U.S. Federal Government authorized construction of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), at a reported cost of $28 billion.|$|E
25|$|Holy wells {{were often}} visited at Beltane, {{and at the}} other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; {{typically}} coins or clooties (see clootie well). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning dew. At dawn on Beltane, maidens would roll in <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected in a jar, left in the sunlight, and then filtered. <b>The</b> <b>dew</b> was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.|$|E

50|$|Membrane {{air dryers}} depress <b>the</b> {{incoming}} <b>dew</b> point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if <b>the</b> inlet <b>dew</b> point {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> point is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F dew point with a challenge of +70 °F dew point and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet dew point of only 32 °F, <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> point will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> point will be lowered. This lowering of <b>the</b> outlet <b>dew</b> point is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet dew point than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent {{on the nature of the}} membrane and could vary among manufacturers.|$|R
25|$|Typically, spacers {{are filled}} with or contain {{desiccant}} to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.|$|E
25|$|Also, a net {{condensation}} {{of water}} vapor occurs on surfaces {{when the temperature}} of the surface is at or below <b>the</b> <b>dew</b> point temperature of the atmosphere. Deposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor. Frost and snow are examples of deposition.|$|E
25|$|A {{target date}} for {{completing}} <b>the</b> <b>DEW</b> Line and having it in operation {{was set for}} 31 July 1957.

25|$|The Distant Early Warning Line, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>DEW</b> Line or Early Warning Line, was a system of radar {{stations}} in the far northern Arctic region of Canada, with additional stations along the North Coast and Aleutian Islands of Alaska, {{in addition to the}} Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. It was set up to detect incoming Soviet bombers during the Cold War, and provide early warning of any sea-and-land invasion.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007 <b>the</b> <b>Dew</b> pond was {{reinstated}} {{on the top}} common by Sheringham Town Council. Many {{years ago}} there were shallow ponds on {{this part of the}} common and in 1939 natterjack toads were recorded in and around the ponds along with common and great crested newts. The reinstatement is an attempt to attract more wildlife back to this part of the common. Until the Second World War, goats, ponies and geese were a common sight grazing in and around the ponds.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the Second World War that the passage was again explored. With the onset of the Cold War, the Canadian Arctic became {{the first line of defense}} against the Soviets so the U.S. and Canada {{developed}} a tight cooperation as the imperative to use this mostly empty territory as a buffer increased. Thus, many early warning systems such as <b>the</b> <b>DEW</b> Line, the Pinetree Line and the Mid-Canada Line were deployed in this region with the North Warning System still in use today.|$|E
