As mayor she performed her tasks efficiently and ensured that the city which was known for its garbage dumps when she took charge was declared and awarded as the cleanest city in India before the end of her tenure.

While exploratory for the most part, it is argued that children are seen as legitimate agents in certain realms of civil society. These are formal,concerned with easily identifiable ‘children’s issues’, and depend upon symbols of imagery and childhood <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> <b>funding</b> and support. When children participate in other realms: informal, associated with ‘adult issues’ and dependent on other symbols and images, their sincerity and legitimacy is questioned. When children participate in the latter they are seen as coerced or manipulated, whereas when they participate in the former they are seen as a legitimate resource to guide advocacy and policy. Yet such an approach overlooks children’s everyday political acts and forms of political awareness and knowledge inside and outside formal civil society actors. This chapter consists of three sections. The first discusses the concepts of civil society and childhood and their use in South Asia.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} causal relationships between trade openness and financial development in Tunisia over the period 1973 - 2013. We used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag method considering the ratio of Liquid liabilities, Private credit and Stock market capitalization as financial development indicators (all per cent of GDP). The sum of export and import {{as a percentage of}} GDP is the measurement of trade openness. Our estimates imply that the long and short-run relationships are different. At long run, trade openness is stimulated by liquid liabilities level while it is negatively affected by the level of private credit and the stock market capitalization. In contrast, the main short-run responses of financial development and openness to international trade are not significant. Moreover, the results reveal a bi-directional causality between private credit and trade openness but a direct unidirectional causality running from financial intermediaries’ ability <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> <b>funds,</b> the size of stock market and trade openness in Tunisia. The policy implications of this study appeared clear. The overcoming of the institutional weaknesses and the establishment of transparent rules are likely to improve the efficiency of the banking sector and the stock market and so to strengthen the foreign trade in Tunisia. ...|$|E

In order to support the analysis, Steward (1989), Consultant Management Service in the US, in Astuti (2006), introduced MVA and EVA concepts to be used as measurement of financial performance to overcome the shortcomings of traditional accounting. The objectives of this research are to analyze the effect of MVA and EVA on stock returns of banking industry at Indonesian Stock Exchange. Theories support this research are Stock Return, MVA and EVA. To achieve the objectives, the research method used is associative with multiple regression analysis. The populations used in this study are listed banking industry at Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2009 to 2012 with 10 banks as the samples. Results and conclusions are the effect of MVA and EVA to Stock Return do not have significant effect simultaneously; partially, MVA have negative relationship and does not have significant effect on Stock Return, while EVA have positive relationship but does not have significant effect on Stock Return. These indicate that MVA and EVA concept is not appropriate to be used to predict stock returns on banking industry. Perhaps traditional accounting is better to measure than MVA and EVA.

The main objective of the project was to support the local CBO (SIDECO) both technically and institutionally in order to enhance the CBO's service delivery capacity. The project specific objective was <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> <b>funds</b> both locally and externally, for improvement of a community sewerage system at Sinza B. A needs assessment was carried out through pair wise ranking tool in order to identify community felt needs. The most felt need by community members was improvement of a community sewerage system in the area. An assessment of SIDECO's capacity was carried out to determine the CBOs capacity to address the community needs. A questionnaire survey was then carried out to determine the level of participation of community members in improvement of the sewerage system. A sample of 250 household heads was selected at random for interviews. Important research findings were (i) high incidence of water-borne diseases especially cholera and diarrhea which were associated to poor sewage system (ii) the majority of respondents (80 %) were willing to contribute to improvement of sewerage system (iii) the minority of respondents (20 %) who were not willing, were tenants in houses they were residing, they perceived that the sewerage service costs were covered in the monthly rents paid (iv) most landlords in Sinza B area belong to medium - high income category and were capable of contributing financially to the improvement of sewerage system, (v) lack of awareness on sanitation and hygiene promotion among the residents of Sinza B was a major obstacle towards improving hygiene in the area and (vi) that the capacity of SIDECO is still inadequate to address the community needs at Sinza B. The recommendation of this study was the CBOs capacity building through development of a "Project Proposal on Improvement of Community Sewerage System in Sinza B". The implementation of the recommendation involved development of the "Project Proposal" to assist in local and external fund raising exercise as well as setting out appropriate mechanism for improvement of the facility. The total project was estimated at Tsh. 121, 452, 000 /- (US$ 110, 411), where the community in Sinza B will contribute Tshs. 60, 575, 000 /- (US$. 55, 068) or 50 %, Kinondoni Municipal Tsh. 6, 950, 000 /-(US$. 6, 318) or 6 % and Japanese Embassy in DSM Tsh. 53, 927, 000 /- (US$. 49, 025) or 44 %.

40|$|Civic Crowdfunding is {{emerging}} as a popular means <b>to</b> <b>mobilize</b> <b>funding</b> from citizens for public projects. A popular mechanism deployed on civic crowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total contributions must reach a predetermined threshold {{in order for the}} project to be provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria; unfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if it is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with refund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is higher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding effort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a public project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand the pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets funded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population. We call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point Mechanisms (REPPM). We specifically propose two variants of REPPM and both these mechanisms have the remarkable property that, at equilibrium, referral bonuses are offered but {{there is no need for}} actual payment of these bonuses. We establish that any given agent's equilibrium strategy is to refer other agents and to contribute in proportion to the agent's true value for the project. By referring others to contribute, an agent can, in fact, reduce his equilibrium contribution. In our view, the proposed mechanisms will lead to an increase in the number of projects that are funded on civic crowdfunding platforms...|$|R
