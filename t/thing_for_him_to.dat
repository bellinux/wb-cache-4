25|$|Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth {{and ask her}} {{to persuade}} John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. John says he is refusing to confess not out of {{religious}} conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened {{by the thought that}} he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it is the wrong <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do, John agrees to falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, Marvel {{revealed}} that the seventh episode would be titled [...] "The Hub", and would be written by Rafe Judkins and Lauren LeFranc, with Bobby Roth directing. Originally titled [...] "The Sandwich Incident", [...] "The Hub" [...] was the eighth episode produced. Executive producer Jed Whedon discussed the writer's intentions to expand their depiction of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the episode, saying, [...] "We're trying to flesh out the world of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the established characters and the characters we're introducing to build out the larger organization that we operate in." [...] This includes the introduction of high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Victoria Hand, who is shown lying to Coulson in the episode. Executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen called this [...] "a very significant <b>thing</b> ... <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> deal with Victoria Hand lying to him and facing {{the fact that the}} organization that he's been dedicating his life to lied to his face about the people within his team ... that's significant in his journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When I {{proposed}} to Lucio my original treatment for Per Sempre, which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per Sempre and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that he originated the story and that I stole it from him is pure science fiction".|$|E

5000|$|On August 15, 2006, Corddry said [...] "I've got like a {{week and}} a half left, all bets are off", and then on August 21, 2006, Stewart remarked that Corddry's last day on The Daily Show would be August 24, 2006. Corddry {{appeared}} throughout the week, once filing a report from inside a toilet bowl supposedly on board an aircraft transporting John Mark Karr, and another dressed up in a 1970s fashion; Stewart remarked, [...] "It's his last week, and really, we're trying to come up with terrible <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There will be {{fifteen years}} in gaol {{at the end}} of this job for everybody," [...] said Shaw, [...] "and I have a boy that don't know his father yet. Fine <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> learn when he grows up. The {{innocent}} are dead certain here to catch it along with you. The missus will break her heart unless she starves first. Home sold up." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "You Gotta Make It Through the World" [...] is {{according}} to Morrison, [...] "a survival song". [...] Dr. John {{felt that it}} had [...] "a real spiritual sound". [...] "It Fills You Up" [...] is an attempt [...] by the singer to explain the inspirational spirit that is often found in his music. [...] "The Eternal Kansas City" [...] is, {{according to}} Dr. John, [...] "the song that Van got the whole album hooked up around. [...] It was a real deep <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> focus on. [...] It goes from a real ethereal voice sound to a jazz introduction and then {{into a kind of}} chunky R" [...] The song, [...] "Joyous Sound" [...] is described by Brian Hinton as [...] "more like the real Van as he starts to wail and the lyrics describe themselves." [...] Morrison said of the track, [...] "Flamingos Fly", [...] "I've done three versions in the studio. [...] I've done it slow, a ballad version. [...] I've done a mid-tempo version and I've done this version. [...] This is the version I like best for release." [...] "Heavy Connection" [...] is said to be [...] "psychic stuff" [...] with the lyrics vague and secret but speaking [...] of a love connection [...] "when you came into my dreams/like from a whisper to a scream." [...] The last song on the album is [...] "Cold Wind in August". [...] Dr. John describes it as a [...] "cross current from forties to seventies music. [...] It's like where Ray Charles left off. [...] It's a real tear-jerker that gets back to the basics of music." [...] "Flamingos Fly" [...] was covered by Sammy Hagar, a year before A Period of Transition was released, on his first solo album Nine on a Ten Scale.|$|E

60|$|A favor {{was asked}} of Tommy. Shovel {{had been told}} by Hump that it was the custom of the toffs to sit beside you and {{question}} you about your crimes, and lacking the imagination that made Tommy such an ornament to the house, the chances were that he would flounder in his answers and be ejected. Hump had pointed this out <b>to</b> <b>him</b> after pocketing the fourpence. Would Tommy, therefore, make up <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> say; reward, the orange.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Marius Penczner. In the video, a man returns to his home (presumably a pontoon house) to find that his significant other has abandoned him, and the word goodbye written in red lipstick on the exterior wall of the pontoon, and his belongings destroyed. She also leaves behind a videotape of her destroying all of the male character's <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> view. The man then drops the television set into the water, since the female character also destroyed the television remote control.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a couple}} of days Walter began to feel at home on the flagship, and he could no longer be termed a [...] "greeny," [...] {{strictly}} speaking, although there were still a great number of <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> learn. He was much interested in the Brooklyn as a whole as well as in detail, and was proud to learn that this armored cruiser was the largest of the class in our navy, having a displacement of 9215 tons, as against her sister ship, the New York, which had a displacement of about a thousand tons less.|$|R

60|$|Steady! Would not {{the best}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> be <b>to</b> step down to Waterloo Bridge and throw himself over? He still had money enough left to pay the toll--though not enough to hire a pistol. And so he went home and got into bed.|$|R
5000|$|Lengyel first {{worked with}} the band on the demo [...] "The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny," [...] and later joined as a {{full-time}} member. He appears on the band's first two major label albums, Mr. Bungle (1991) and Disco Volante (1995), and also appears - along with several other Mr. Bungle members - as a special guest on the Melt Banana song Area 877 Mix, off of their 1998 album Charlie. According to Mr. Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn, [...] "we unanimously decided to go on without him because he wasn't growing {{with the rest of}} the band and we were running out of <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do. He got pissed off and I haven't heard from him since." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Eight ever nine never" [...] refers only to when declarer {{can afford}} no loser in the suit: {{there are many}} more <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> think about when declarer can afford a loser. For example, if the finesse would land in the hand of the {{dangerous}} opponent who can give the other opponent a ruff that declarer can't afford, with eight cards he might have to play for a [...] "drop" [...] by playing the ace and king then a small one to the jack. Even if the finesse would have lost, now the dangerous opponent can't give his partner a ruff, because he can't have any more trumps left (if the queen didn't fall under the ace and king, the potential ruffer can't have more than two cards in the suit).|$|R

5000|$|The younger William de Briouze {{visited the}} house in Swansea to which Cragh's corpse had been taken that evening, and what he saw {{convinced}} him that Cragh was dead. Describing the scene some years later he recalled that: His Cragh's face was black and in parts bloody or stained with blood. His eyes {{had come out of}} their sockets and hung outside the eyelids and the sockets were filled with blood. His mouth, neck, and throat and the parts around them, and also his nostrils, were filled with blood, so that it was impossible in the natural course of <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> breathe ... his tongue hung out of his mouth, the length of a man's finger, and it was completely black and swollen and as thick with the blood sticking to it that it seemed the size of a man's two fists together.|$|R

500|$|Selman commented in {{an audio}} {{commentary}} for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] that [...] "the {{thing that really}} got the [...] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart." [...] Greaney identified this version as [...] "the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else {{that they used to}} be cool, that it's everyone else's fault that his life hasn't gone the way he wants it to go." [...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is {{the kind of person who}} is [...] "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later." [...] Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart <b>to</b> say and <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
