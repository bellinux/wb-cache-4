In the earliest years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women. In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E
25|$|The {{right of}} women to vote has {{sometimes}} been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, {{it was not until}} 1964 <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the National Association of the Deaf in the United States were first allowed to vote.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{fraternity}} men {{are three times}} more likely to commit rape than other men on college campuses.

25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different.

25|$|Supporters of {{regulation}} {{were able to}} show statements from women in prostitution that they felt safer in brothels than on the streets, health checks let them gain business by showing clients they had {{a clean bill of}} health, and government regulation removed the stigma of their occupation.

There were demonstrations in Iran in March 1979, after the hijab law was brought in, decreeing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Iran would have to wear scarves to leave the house.|$|E

25|$|Gender and sex {{are also}} {{components}} of health disparity {{in the female}} population. The 2012 World Development Report (WDR) noted <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> developing nations experience greater mortality rates than men in developing nations. Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden--a disparity that {{is much greater than}} that for neonatal or child mortality.|$|E
25|$|Low {{wages in}} {{absolute}} terms and low wages relative to men's wages in the aggregate, however, do not provide a full picture of gender economic equity. The ratio of income for women to men for equal work is another significant financial indicator of economic gender equality.

The World Economic Forum's 2012 Gender Report found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia all received approximately 60% of the wages of a male for the same work.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing mosquito bites {{in areas}} where the disease occurs and proper use of condoms. Efforts to prevent bites include the use of insect repellent, covering much of the body with clothing, mosquito nets, and getting rid of standing water where mosquitoes reproduce.

Health officials recommended <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> areas affected by the 2015–16 Zika outbreak consider putting off pregnancy and that pregnant women not travel to these areas.
