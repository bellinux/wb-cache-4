5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family {{to pass through the}} lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|Watchet {{developed}} as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships plying trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import of salt and wine from France. In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (Roundhead) Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on <b>the</b> <b>ebb,</b> <b>and</b> with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick politics {{are different from}} those of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, even when there is a majority government present. In this manner, <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E
25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow {{direction}} and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, {{with the primary}} and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of {{closures}} of major industrial employers {{took place in the}} first half of the 20th century, due to <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of trade. Andrew's Gas Engine Works was taken over in 1905 by Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, the business was transferred to Grantham and the Reddish works closed some time during the great depression following WWI. Cronin indicates that the works were still in operation in 1930. The Atlas wire rope works closed in 1927.|$|E

25|$|Various {{proposals}} for a fixed link across the Northumberland Strait {{can be traced}} {{as far back as}} the 1870s when the province's railway system was developed. Subsequent proposals arose during federal elections in the late 1950s and early 1960s. <b>The</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of public support for a fixed link was indirectly tied to the varying levels of federal investment in ferry and steamship connections to the province over the years, finally culminating in a proposal in the mid-1980s which resulted in the current bridge being constructed.|$|E

Built in 1403 AD (810 AH) Timur is buried in the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, under a fluted dome. The tomb employs a traditional Persian iwan as an entrance. The 1528 AD (935 AH) Tomb of Babur in Kabul is much more modest in comparison, with a simple cenotaph exposed to the sky, laid out in the centre of a walled garden.|$|E
25|$|Slightly paralleled by A. L. Rowse, {{author of}} Shakespeare's Sonnets: The Problems Solved, lines 3-4 are {{interpreted}} as {{alluding to the}} youth's beauty as a contrast with his friends. As the youth's beauty wanes, so his friends wither, as he grows older; contrasting Sethna's view of the youth's beauty accentuating Shakespeare's lack of beauty. Rowse also suggests that this idea may also imply a further consistency; Shakespeare's concern with <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of things; their waxing and waning. Perhaps the influence of constant Ovidian thought.|$|E

25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Other seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} {{phases of the}} Western {{recovery}} of Aristotle, Robert Grosseteste (c.1175–1253), influenced by medieval Platonism and by the astronomy of al-Bitruji, rejected {{the idea that the}} heavens are moved by either souls or intelligences. [...] Adam Marsh's (c.1200–1259) treatise On <b>the</b> <b>Ebb</b> <b>and</b> Flow of the Sea, which was formerly attributed to Grosseteste, maintained al-Bitruji's opinion that the celestial spheres and the seas are moved by a peripheral mover whose motion weakens with distance.|$|E

This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on <b>the</b> <b>Ebb</b> <b>and</b> Flow of the Sea.

500|$|... "Timewave zero" [...] is a numerological {{formula that}} purports to {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of [...] "novelty", defined as increase {{over time in}} the universe's interconnectedness, or organized complexity. Terence McKenna claimed that the universe has a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. The scientific community considers novelty theory to be pseudoscience.|$|E
500|$|A disjunct {{northern}} {{population of}} T. oreades grows together with T.mongaensis {{in the southern}} Monga Valley in southern New South Wales, with some hybrids reported. Crisp and Weston concluded that the two species {{for the most part}} did not hybridise there.
