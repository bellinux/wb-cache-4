Brand paid a Hungarian counter-espionage officer to bring his wife's relatives back safely.|$|E

On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date.

Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes.

However, these concessions were strictly regulated, and land was only offered to those individuals able <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>they</b> had the necessary capital to develop it. Exceptions were made during the Ndebele and Shona insurrections against the BSAC in the mid 1890s, when land was promised to any European men willing {{to take up arms}} in defence of the colony, irrespective of their financial status. The settlers of the Pioneer Column were granted tracts of 3150 acres apiece, with an option to purchase more land from the BSAC's holdings at relatively low prices (up to fifteen times cheaper than comparable land on the market in South Africa).|$|E
