He played with Bobby Byrne in late 1942, then with Charlie Barnet for whom he wrote the classic {{arrangement}} of Skyliner.

25|$|The {{independent}} wrestlers {{were well}} {{received by the}} Arena Coliseo crowd, cheering especially for the portions of the match where Blue Panther and Negro Navarro wrestled against each other. The match ended when Averno forced Black Terry to submit and Blue Panther forced Villano IV to submit to win the third fall. Afterwards the fans showed their appreciation of the match by throwing money into the ring, causing both Panther and Navarro <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> into the seats to collect more money after the match. Both Panther and Navarro teased {{that they were going}} to continue to fight, which drew a favorable response from the crowd. Before the fifth match of the night Ray Mendoza, Jr. took the microphone and announced to the crowd that this would actually be his last match as a professional wrestler. Rayo de Jalisco and his team won both the second and third fall to win the entire match. In the main event the challenger La Sombra and the champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. quickly split the first two falls between them, tied up at 1–1. The third fall was longer than both the previous falls combined and finally saw Dragón Rojo, Jr. successfully defend the championship when he forced La Sombra to submit.|$|E
500|$|When General Amherst left North America in 1763, {{it was on}} a {{leave of}} absence from his {{position}} as commander-in-chief. In 1764, Amherst announced that {{he had no intention of}} returning to North America, at which point Gage's appointment to that post was made permanent. (Amherst retained posts as governor of Virginia and colonel of the 60th Foot, positions he only gave up in 1768 when he was required <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> to Virginia or give up the post.) [...] Intrigues of other high-ranking officers, especially Robert Monckton and his supporters, for his offices, continued throughout his tenure as commander-in-chief. Gage was promoted to lieutenant general in 1771. [...] In 1767 Gage ordered the arrest of Major Robert Rogers, the former leader of Rogers' Rangers who Gage had come to dislike and distrust during the war. The arrest was based on flimsy evidence that Rogers might have been engaging in a treasonous relationship with the French; he was acquitted in a 1768 court martial.|$|E
500|$|Universal spent $1.8 million {{promoting}} Jaws, {{including an}} unprecedented $700,000 {{on national television}} spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, {{in the description of}} film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal [...] "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" [...] for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that [...] "no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that [...] "you had <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> underneath the shark so you could see his teeth." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{also noted}} that the {{potential}} for interracial conflict remained unexplored; Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie wants to tease us with intimations of a steamy biracial liaison; it just doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> there." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe was disappointed that [...] "Obsessed basically plays it safe. The obvious racial buttons are never pushed". Greg Quill from the Toronto Star agreed, and wrote that Shill and Loughery [...] "stripped the drama of its potentially gripping – and obvious – racial overtones". However, Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer pointed out that having the two female roles of differing races [...] "creates racial tension", and noted similarities to [...] "the racially charged" [...] Lakeview Terrace (2008), which Loughery also wrote. Braun was of the impression that a well-written script was replaced by the film's [...] "racial politics". When Derek confronts Lisa at the business conference, she threatens him with a sexual harassment complaint; Sady Doyle from The Guardian wrote that this alludes to [...] "the history of black men being lynched for their perceived threat to white women". Doyle pointed out that historically white women are more revered for their beauty than black women, which is a side theme of the fight between Sharon and Lisa. Melissa Anderson of LA Weekly suggested that awkwardness of the interracial relationship of Derek and Lisa as a reason why the filmmakers did not have the two characters partake in any sexual activity.|$|E
500|$|Within the novel, the Law forbids {{violence}} between {{the inhabitants of}} the Place. Despite its seemingly unyielding nature, it is in fact broken several times, though always with [...] "good reason". In the story [...] "His Mate", Lad meets and later must win the heart of his mate, Lady. Lad is clearly [...] "enthralled" [...] by the adult Lady's sexual appeal. As Terhune seems reluctant to note the facts of canine mating, Lady is never stated <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> into heat. Instead the relationship is framed {{within the context of a}} [...] "human courtly love triangle" [...] when the [...] "showy" [...] Knave comes to the Place and Lady forgets Lad and fawns on the new arrival. When Lady is believed to have destroyed a beloved mounted bald eagle, the master breaks the rules against violence and intends to beat her. Lad, in turn, breaks the rules of perfect obedience and growls, becoming the object of punishment and taking the beating in her stead. At the end of the story, when the master realizes he was mistaken, he apologizes to Lad for beating the wrong dog. Despite the novel's overall theme of nonviolence, the master's [...] "unreasonable attachment to the bird" [...] becomes the motivation for his [...] "cruelty toward the helpless dogs", yet Lad perceives the Master's actions as [...] "reasonable and functional". Though the numerous tenets of the Law forbid violence in various forms, if the dogs harm something of sentimental value it is deemed justifiable to treat them with [...] "any amount of violence." [...] This change is seen as reflecting a lack of maturity in the Master, and his having a [...] "childish fixation on having his own way", showing a desire to have control and order over that which can never be perfectly ordered: everyday life. Throughout many of the stories, a consistent theme is the Master's imposition of will, behind which is the [...] "blind rage of a child who cannot get exactly what he wants." ...|$|E
