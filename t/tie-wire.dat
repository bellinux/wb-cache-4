50|$|An {{example is}} the {{operators}} who in {{the division of labor}} have all the equipment. Most operators will not operate equipment they perceive as lowly such as skid steer, kick-brooms and telescopic handlers, laborers usually are used to operate these unless an operator apprentice is available and demands his right to operate. The same is true for most other trades except the ironworkers who are notorious for protecting their work and not wanting anyone else to touch their steel, <b>tie-wire</b> or Kliens. The advantage to this system is that many laborers gain sufficient experience working with another trade to journeyman-in while earning a higher wage than an apprentice. Many foremen will gradually give a laborer extra responsibility until they are performing at a journeyman level and can enter a more skilled union as a journeyman.|$|E
5000|$|Rice-hull bagwall {{construction}} {{is a system}} of building, with results aesthetically similar {{to the use of}} earthbag or cob construction, in which woven polypropylene bags (or tubes) are tightly filled with raw rice-hulls, and these are stacked up, layer upon layer, with strands of four-pronged barbed wire between, within a surrounding [...] "cage" [...] composed of mats of welded or woven steel mesh (remesh or [...] "poultry wire") on both sides (wired together between bag layers with, for example, rebar <b>tie-wire)</b> and then stuccoed, to form building walls. Advantages (compared to earth-bag or cob) include less weight to handle/process, far better insulation values (around 3 - 4 per inch), use of an agricultural-waste product and the sequestration of CO2. This building approach was originally innovated and tested by Don Stephens, in the northwestern U.S. in 2005.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This work {{concerns}} the root-cause {{investigation of the}} blade damage in a steam turbine bladed disk of a thermoelectric power plant. The purpose of this work is to investigate the low cycle fatigue problem by determining the natural frequencies and the associated modes of vibrations of a bladed disk and comparing with the operational rotation of the turbine and its harmonics. The bladed disk is an assembly of several blades grouped and each group is an assembly {{of four or five}} blades, connected by elements named shroud and <b>tie-wire.</b> The computational model of a single blade and of a blades grouped are fitting by modal analysis measurements. Finally, a numerical modal analysis is made on a complete bladed disk in order to investigate the low cycle fatigue problem...|$|E

40|$|Artificial reefs {{are often}} {{discouraged}} in shallow waters over concerns of storm damage to structures and surrounding habitat. Biorock coral reef restoration projects were initiated in waters around 5 m deep in Grand Turk, at Oasis (October 2006) and at Governor’s Beach (November 2007). Hemi-cylindrical steel modules, 6 m long were used, four modules at Oasis and six at Governor’s Beach. Each project has over 1200 corals transplanted from sites with high sedimentation damage, and are regularly monitored for coral growth, mortality and fish populations. Corals show immediate growth over wires used to attach corals. Growth has been measured from photographs using {{a software program}} and is faster at Governor’s Beach. After hurricanes Hanna and Ike (September 2008) the Governor’s Beach structure was fully standing since the waves passed straight through with little damage, the Oasis structures which were <b>tie-wired</b> rather than welded had one module collapse (since been replaced with a new, welded structure). Hurricane Ike was the strongest hurricane on record to hit Grand Turk. Most cables were replaced following the hurricanes due to damage from debris and high wave action. The projects lost {{about a third of}} the corals due to hurricanes. Most of those lost had only been wired a few days before and had not yet attached themselves firmly. These projects have regenerated corals and fish populations in areas of barren sand or bedrock and are now attractive to snorkelers. High coral survival and low structural damage after hurricanes indicate that Biorock reef restoration can be effective in storm-impacted areas. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (Suppl. 3) : 141 - 149.

40|$|International audienceIn turbomachines, dry {{friction}} devices (under platform dampers, shrouds, and <b>tie-wire)</b> are usually introduced to reduce resonant responses of bladed disks. Dry friction between rubbing elements induces a highly nonlinear dynamic behaviour which flattens the frequency response functions. It {{is clear that}} such behaviour requires an optimisation process to find the optimum parameters {{that lead to the}} minimum forced response amplitudes. However, different interpretations still remain concerning the explanation of the physical origin of this type of flattening. The most common one is based on dissipated energy. In this case, heat resulting from the relative frictional motion between contacting surfaces is supposed to bring sufficient dissipation to flatten response functions. On the other hand, a different approach considers that a decrease in vibrational amplitudes is explained by changes in boundary conditions induced by a stick/slip behaviour. In this study, a single degree-of-freedom system is used and analysed both in time and in frequency domains (Harmonic Balance Method) in order to show the contribution of respectively energy dissipation and change of contact state on peak levels...|$|E
