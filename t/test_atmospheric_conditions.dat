40|$|The mining {{industry}} {{is among the}} top ten industries nationwide with high occupational injury and fatality rates, and mine rescue response may be {{considered one of the}} most hazardous activities in mining operations. In the aftermath of an underground mine fire, explosion or water inundation, specially equipped and trained teams have been sent underground to fight fires, rescue entrapped miners, <b>test</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions,</b> investigate the causes of the disaster, or recover the dead. Special personal protective ensembles are used by the team members to improve the protection of rescuers against the hazards of mine rescue and recovery. Personal protective ensembles used by mine rescue teams consist of helmet, cap lamp, hood, gloves, protective clothing, boots, kneepads, facemask, breathing apparatus, belt, and suspenders. While improved technology such as wireless warning and communication systems, lifeline pulleys, and lighted vests have been developed for mine rescuers over the last 100 years, recent research in this area of personal protective ensembles has been minimal due to the trending of reduced exposure of rescue workers. In recent years, the exposure of mine rescue teams to hazardous situations has been changing. However, it is vital that members of the teams have the capability and proper protection to immediately respond to a wide range of hazardous situations. Currently, there are no minimum requirements, best practice documents, or nationally recognized consensus standards for protective clothing used by mine rescue teams in the United States (U. S.). The following review provides a summary of potential issues that can be addressed by rescue teams and industry to improve potential exposures to rescue team members should a disaster situation occur. However, the continued trending in the {{mining industry}} toward non-exposure to potential hazards for rescue workers should continue to be the primary goal. To assist in continuing this trend, the mining industry and regulatory agencies have been more restrictive by requiring additional post disaster information regarding atmospheric conditions and other hazards before exposing rescue workers and others in the aftermath of a mine disaster. In light of some of the more recent mine rescuer fatalities such as the Crandall Canyon Mine and Jim Walters Resources in the past years, the direction of reducing exposure is preferred. This review provides a historical perspective on ensembles used during mine rescue operations and summarizes environmental hazards, critical elements of mine rescue ensembles, and key problems with these elements. This study also identifies domains for improved mine rescue ensembles. Furthermore, field observations from several coal mine rescue teams were added to provide the information on the currently used mine rescue ensembles in the U. S.

A new acoustic technique is utilized to measure the circulation produced {{in the wake of}} lift-generating aircraft. Ultrasonic signals are transmitted in a path around the wake vortex, and are used to determine the average in-line velocity component along the acoustic path.

This is the first study to take this methodology and implement it in a realistic airport setting.

40|$|Lagrangian {{particle}} dispersion {{models are}} indispensable tools to study atmospheric transport processesbased on {{the flow of}} individual air parcels. In operational uses cases {{they are used to}} simulate the spread of radionuclides or volcanic emissionsin emergency situations. Different Lagrangian particle dispersion models have been developed for those studies, like FLEXPART or HYSPLIT. It is very important that the models are verified and their errors are estimated so that the results are reliable. In this thesis the advection and diffusion part of the new Lagrangian particle dispersionmodel Massive Parallel Trajectory Calculations (MPTRAC) was verified in idealized test cases and inreal <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> and optimized in terms of accuracy and performance. Analytical test cases were applied to the model to validate the advection. The implementation and accuracy of integration schemes of different order,the error caused by the linear interpolation of the wind fields and the used coordinate system were discussed. All implementations lead to correct and very accurate results. A notable difference concerning the accuracy was only determined between the first order Euler method and other methods of higher order. Runge-Kutta methods of the order 2 to 4 and the Petterssen scheme led to very similar results, indicating that an order of larger than 2 can not increase the accuracy significantly. This is partly caused by the linear interpolation of the meteorological data. Even if tests have shown that the error caused by this linear interpolation is small, higher order methods may need a better interpolation to provide benefits. <b>Tests</b> for real <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> confirm these results, i. g., the midpoint method was found to be the most performant integration scheme. However, a small time step is required to yieldsmall deviations from the reference solution. For the <b>tests</b> with real <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> the atmosphere was separated into regions with similar conditions and the resulting transport deviations are analyzed in detail. Simulation errors in the stratosphere and in the tropics are significantly smaller than in the troposphere or at high latitudes. The diffusion scheme of MPTRAC consists of three components, a random horizontal displacement, a random vertical displacement, and a mesoscale diffusion that depends on the variation of the wind field around an air parcel. All three components were tested individually without advection and produced results that correspond to analytical solutions. However, it is difficult to predict a solution under real <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions,</b> because the wind field has a significant influence. A sensitivity test was done, to get an overview {{of the impact of the}} diffusion components on the transport of air parcels. The mesoscale diffusion has the strongest influence, if default parameters are used, followed by the vertical diffusion. The horizontal diffusion has only a very small impact and does not seem to influence the transport simulations significantly. In conclusion, the model MPTRAC can be used to simulate the advection and dispersion of air parcels correctly and efficiently. Simulations with altitudes below the free troposphere require relatively small time steps and the diffusion model isprobably too simplistic, but the main task of the model are simulations in the free troposphere and stratosphere where the model shows good results...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{focus of}} this project was to {{investigate}} the working of a liquefied gas micro satellite thruster. An introduction is given in which the significance of the project in relation to the literature is stated. The objectives of the project are also stated. In the literature survey the historical development and design specifications of some relevant thruster systems is discussed. An experimental model was designed and built to test the working of a thruster system. Attention is also given to the measurement and calibration techniques used to obtain experimental data. A computer program was written to simulate the thruster system. The experimental set-up was designed so that an accumulator could be charged with liquid butane from a storage tank. The accumulator was charged with 13 ml of liquid butane, which was heated and then exhausted through a nozzle. Copper mesh was placed in the accumulator to improve the heat transfer to the butane vapour before it was exhausted through the nozzle. A cantilever beam was used to measure the thrust of the system. The system was <b>tested</b> under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> of 100 000 Pa as well as under vacuum conditions of 20 Pa. Two nozzles were also tested: nozzle- 1 with a throat diameter of 1 mm and an exit diameter of 5 mm and nozzle- 2 with a throat diameter of 1 mm and an exit diameter of 1. 6 mm. A computer program was written to simulate the flow of the butane vapour through the nozzle, as well as the complex two-phase behaviour of the butane in the accumulator. Traditional gas dynamic theory was used to model the flow through the nozzle. The transient behaviour of the system was modelled to predict the rate of liquid to vapour mass transfer in the accumulator. Additionally, the computer program was developed to simulate the system with copper mesh placed in the accumulator. From the experimental results it was shown that the addition of copper mesh in the accumulator improved the total thrust achieved with a 13 ml charge of liquid butane by more than 50 %. Under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> shockwaves were present in both of the two nozzles tested. Nozzle- 2 showed an increase of 91 % in the total thrust achieved over a 5 second burst compared to the total thrust achieved using nozzle- 1. With no copper mesh in the accumulator and using nozzle- 1 a peak thrust of 39 mN was achieved under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> while under vacuum conditions a peak thrust of 495 mN was achieved. This resulted in a total thrust of 0. 365 Ns under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> and 4. 88 Ns under vacuum conditions with a 13 ml charge of liquid butane. Using the total thrust achieved the specific impulse of the system was calculated as 5 seconds under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> and 67. 5 seconds under vacuum conditions with no mesh in the accumulator and using nozzle- 1. The theoretical model compared well with the experimental results except when nozzle- 1 was modelled under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions.</b> Under vacuum conditions the results obtained from the theoretical model compared well with the experimental results using both of the nozzles. In the modelling of the mesh in the accumulator an overall heat transfer factor was incorporated into the model {{to take into account the}} uncertainty of the heat transfer area as well as the overall heat transfer coefficient. The theoretical model and experimental test results are discussed and thereafter conclusions are also drawn. There are also recommendations made for future work that could be done in the further development of a liquefied gas micro satellite thruster system. It is recommended that a “resistojet” type thruster should be tested at the University of Stellenbosch and that further testing be done with mesh in the accumulator to find the optimum amount of mesh that should be placed in the accumulator...|$|R

The systems are regularly <b>tested</b> under real <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> at the eye-safe high-power laser test range in Lampoldshausen near Stuttgart. The correction of turbulence effects with adaptive-optical compensated imaging is essential for target reconnaissance and tracking of aim-points on moving targets.

It has a feedback-loop bandwidth of 900 Hz and is capable to compensate for residual wavefront deformations down to 15 nm RMS. The system can correct phase distortions in a conjugated plane with time constants of 30 ms. Large bandwidth fine tracking units are successfully used to achieve the tip/tilt correction of atmospheric turbulence effects. We designed and engineered a tip/tilt system adapted to a 10 ” telescope which is able to counterbalance turbulence induced laser beam deflection down to the sub µrad range at distorting frequencies of several hundreds of Hz. Position detection is performed with quadrant detectors and the tip/tilt correction with Piezo actuator based mirrors.

The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is explained on the basis of in-situ OH chemiluminescence images and prior numerical simulations of the resulting complex flow field. The flow guide vane is observed to lead to a counterclockwise cavity vortex, which is conducive to the rise of cavity combustion products along the inclined struts and subsequent mixing with the mainstream flow...|$|R
40|$|A problem exists when {{applying}} {{a set of}} ground training signatures determined under one <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> to the same area under another <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition.</b> Sometimes the training signatures need to be adapted to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> of the subject area before classification. Other times the radiance measurements of an area with variable <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> need to be adjusted to a common <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> before classification. In order to describe {{the effects of the}} atmosphere on the ground-reflected radiance measured by the LANDSAT- 1 satellite, a radiative transfer model was developed. The model is a combination of a doubling I model, which describes the effects of molecular and aerosol scattering in the atmosphere, and a scaling-approximation absorption model which takes into account the gaseous absorption due to oxygen, ozone and water vapor in the LANDSAT- 1 spectral region. The model indicates that atmospheric effects can be approximated by linear transforms. The transform shows that the atmosphere always degredes the albedo difference but not necessarily the color difference. Signature transformations of Lambertian surfaces due to changes in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> can be determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the {{technical}} challenges and requirements of modal testing a solar sail system (Fig. 1). Specific objectives of this work are to investigate the effectiveness (i. e. accuracy, precision, repeatability, etc.) of laser vibrometer measurements obtained on solar sail components (i. e. sail membrane quadrant and masts) actuated with various excitation methods in vacuum conditions. Results from this work will be used to determine the appropriate test technique for testing large scale full quadrant flight-like solar sail system hardware in vacuum conditions. This paper will focus on the dynamic tests conducted in-vacuum on a 10 -meter solar sail quadrant development by AEC-ABLE as part of a ground demonstrator system development program funded by NASA's In-Space Propulsion program. One triangular shaped quadrant of a solar sail membrane (Fig. 2) was modal tested in a 1 Torr vacuum environment using various excitation techniques including, shaker excitation through the masts, magnetic excitation (Ref. 3), and surface-bonded piezoelectric patch actuators (Ref. 4 & 5). The excitation methods are evaluated for their applicability to in-vacuum ground testing and their traceability to the development of on-orbit flight test techniques. The solar sail masts (Fig. 3) were also <b>tested</b> in ambient <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> and vacuum using various excitation techniques and these methods will also be assessed for their ground test capabilities and traceability to on-orbit flight testing...|$|R

40|$|Catalytic {{combustion}} systems {{represent a}} potentially significant technology development in low-NOx gas turbine technology. The challenges {{associated with the}} implementation of catalytic combustion in a gas turbine include the need to present both a uniform fuel/air mixture as well as a uniform approach velocity to the catalyst within a minimal volume. The effort described herein addresses the design of catalytic combustor premixer for use on a small frame industrial (5 MW) stationary gas turbine. The general requirements for the premixer were to provide velocity and fuel air mixture uniformity at the exit plane of ± 10 % of the mean and ± 3 % of the mean respectively at nominal idle and full load conditions while maintaining a pressure drop of 4 % maximum. The target turbine's packaging and air-flow path presented an additional challenge requiring the flow to make a 180 degree flow reversal immediately upstream of the combustor. Computational fluid dynamics modeling was. utilized to iterate the mixer design. A unique solution was obtained utilizing an involute shaped contraction/throat/expansion scheme. The most promising design was fabricated and <b>tested</b> at <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions.</b> As compared to a "baseline" mixer, the final involute design improved upon the flow mixing and velocity uniformity. The novel premixer design also eliminated the use of fuel injection spokes and static mixers, relying upon fuel injection from the wall and a high turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) throat section to provide the mixing, thereby simplify manufacturing. To test both scaling issues in the mixer and to provide an opportunity to test the design at high pressure, a 25 % scale (approximate) reduced size mixer was designed and fabricated. Subsequent atmospheric and elevated pressure (11 atm, 1110 kPa) testing confirmed that the mixture uniformity was maintained and the general concept was applicable at both a reduced scale and at elevated pressures. Finally the premixer was integrated with a catalyst and fueled to confirm the overall system performance. The emissions of NOx were < 1 ppm...|$|R
