5|$|During the 1980s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} Government of Norway to have a permanent base in Queen Maud Land. The area had been annexed as a dependency on 14 January 1939, at the time mainly based on Norwegian whaling interests in the Antarctic. From 1956, Norway operated the research station Norway Station, but this was given to South Africa in 1959. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Norway's research activities in Antarctica were sporadic and without a fixed base. This gave the advantage <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> was not bound geographically, but it weakened the Norwegian claim for Queen Maud Land {{and the right to}} participate as a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. In 1989, any party to the Treaty could ask for it to be renegotiated, and Norwegian authorities saw the need for a permanent base to strengthen Norway's claim to Queen Maud Land.|$|E
5|$|From 1978, Ecclestone was {{president}} of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Research</b> Octane Number (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.|$|E

5|$|Further {{examination}} of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy. Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population; they learn <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. They hope to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project—his real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in military uniform, {{taking part in the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E

25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability.

25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} all the research continually focused on is that community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals.

The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical {{to keep in mind that}} the HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} {{during the course}} of the case study, the NIMH voiced misgivings about the lack of scientific data researchers generated from the case study and the disorganized state of project records. Outside of the linguistics aspect of research David Rigler did not clearly define any parameters for the scope of the study, and both the extremely high volume and incoherence of the research team's data left the scientists unable to determine the importance of much of the information they collected. After the initial grant and a one-year extension Rigler proposed an additional three-year extension, and the NIMH's grants committee acknowledged that the study had clearly benefited Genie but concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> team had not adequately addressed their concerns. In a unanimous decision the committee denied the extension request, cutting off further funding.|$|E

25|$|The MBA {{dissertation}} (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, {{comprise the}} following in some combination: {{a discussion of}} the literature, providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a case study that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project. Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an action learning orientation, these may be practically oriented. Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 a {{copyright}} case Qimron v.

Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge Dalia Dorner ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others. In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge Aharon Barak, the verdict was upheld in Israeli Supreme Court in Qimron's favor. The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.|$|E
25|$|Bringing science {{into the}} public eye also coincided with the rapid rate at which {{recombinant}} DNA technology entered the industrial world. Because of the practical applications of the technology, funding for research using it started coming more {{from the private sector}} and less from the public sector. In addition, many molecular biologists who once confined themselves to academia, developed ties with private industry as equity owners, corporate executives and consultants. This {{led to the creation of}} a biotechnology industry, although during this time, public debates occur over the hazards of recombinant DNA. These debates were eventually won over by scientists who stated that the hazards were exaggerated and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> could be conducted safely. Such was seen in the Ascot report, found in the Federal Register in March 1978. This report emphasized that the hazards of recombinant DNA to the general community were small to the point that they were of no practical consequence to the general public. For this reason, along with high economic pressures for industrial development and a more supportive political environment that existed after 1979, research and industry based on recombinant DNA continued to expand.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{individuals}} in Japan after their 1945 surrender was Lieutenant Colonel Murray Sanders, who arrived in Yokohama via the American ship Sturgess in September 1945. Sanders was a highly regarded microbiologist {{and a member of}} America's military center for biological weapons. Sanders' duty was to investigate Japanese biological warfare activity. At the time of his arrival in Japan he had no knowledge of what Unit 731 was. Until Sanders finally threatened the Japanese with bringing communism into the picture, little information about biological warfare was being shared with the Americans. The Japanese wanted to avoid the Soviet legal system so the next morning after the threat Sanders received a manuscript describing Japan's involvement in biological warfare. Sanders took this information to General Douglas MacArthur, who was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers responsible for rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupations. MacArthur struck a deal with Japanese informants—he secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing America, but not the other wartime allies, with their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation. American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail. The U.S. believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> data were valuable. The U.S. did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons.|$|E
25|$|Palme {{presented}} his report on November 12, 1959. The report suggests that Sweden should chose {{to maintain its}} freedom of action, i.e. not to commit to any views in the issue of nuclear weapons acquisition. As a concession to the nuclear opponents, Palme suggested to postpone the final decision on the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Freedom of action should be maintained through continued nuclear weapons research and a clear demonstration to the nuclear weapons supporters <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> would not imply any real delay as the civil nuclear program had been pursued in parallel to the military program for several years. The research was not explicitly promoted {{as a replacement for}} L-program, rather it was promoted as “expanded defense research”. This report implied that the drafted 1958 S-program could be continued and in fact moved even closer to the L-program in scope. The leadership of the Social Democratic party adopted the working group's line on December 14, 1959, so did the Party Congress in 1960. The Government Directive to FOA was issued on June 17, 1960. As a result, in 1958, the Swedish government prohibited research and development (R) of nuclear weapons. Regardless, research activities related to how best to defend against a nuclear weapons attack were continued.|$|E
