40|$|A non-contact, {{non-destructive}} {{method is}} described {{that allows the}} user to measure pavement texture and loaded and unloaded profiles from a moving vehicle. ^ The device uses laser distance measuring <b>gages.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gages</b> are arranged such that their readings can be interpreted to give the loaded and unloaded pavement profiles and a measure of its texture.
