5000|$|<b>Tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> or Mexican leaftosser, Sclerurus (mexicanus) mexicanus ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (Sclerurus mexicanus) is a {{tropical}} American bird {{species in the}} ovenbird family Furnariidae. It {{is also known as}} the tawny-throated leafscraper, Mexican leaftosser or Mexican leafscraper. This bird might be a cryptic species complex.|$|E
50|$|The {{short-billed leaftosser}} (S. rufigularis) is widely {{sympatric}} in the Amazonas basin. It looks almost alike {{but it has}} a shorter bill and its song, while structured similarly, changes in pitch several times through its course rather than simply descending. It is also an inhabitant of terra firme forest near rivers, whereas the <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> prefers hilly terrain.|$|E
50|$|The {{short-billed leaftosser}} is a stocky bird {{with a short}} tail. It reaches a length of about 15 cm and {{compared}} to other leaftossers its beak is short, being 15 mm rather than 25 mm long. Otherwise, it is similar in appearance to the <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (Sclerurus mexicanus) being dark brown with a buffy-ochre throat and rufous breast. It may have a faint reddish-brown eye-stripe and pale brown eye-ring.|$|E
5000|$|The scaly-throated leaftosser is a {{medium-sized}} bird about 17 cm in length {{with a long}} beak and short tail. It {{is similar to the}} <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (Sclerurus mexicanus) in having deep brown upper parts, a tawny breast and dark brown underparts. It differs in not having a rufous rump, and in having a whitish throat, each feather on throat and breast having a black margin, which gives the bird the appearance of being scaled. The call is a harsh, shrill [...] "Schreeek" [...] and the song a descending series of clear whistling-notes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> {{ranges from}} {{southern}} Mexico through Central America into Colombia, {{and from there}} south to the Peruvian Andes as well as southeast to the Amazon Basin, with an isolated population in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The species is largely absent from Venezuela and is patchily distributed across most of its range, particularly Central America. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests and tropical moist montane evergreen forests. It prefers hilly terrain, occurring mainly between 700 and 2,200 m ASL in Central America, and from near sea level to 1,500 m and locally to 2,000 m ASL in South America.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song of the}} <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> is {{a series}} of 4-9 wheezy notes which descend, {{accelerate}} and fade out as they are given: peeeeee-peeeee-peeee-chrrrr. For some populations, slightly different songs have been described; subspecies pullus produces a series of sharp squee calls or a whistling pseeer-pseer-pseer-psee-pse, while subspecies peruvianus has a series of clear suweet whistles and its song often ends in a trill. It is not clear whether these vocalizations indicate specific distinctiveness, but it is notable that at least in peruvianus the song often ends with a [...] "flourish" [...] and does not quietly fade out as it does in the northern populations.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the higher}} {{elevations}} within Bladen {{have not yet}} been studied, those of Columbia River Forest Reserve and Doyle’s Delight (within Chiquibul Forest Reserve) have both been the focus of expeditions with experienced ornithologists recording the avifauna. These areas are contiguous with those of Bladen, and from the data at these two sites, there appears to be almost complete species overlap. With these areas being so remote and inaccessible, there has also been the addition of new species records for Belize, such as the scaly-throated foliage-gleaner (Anabacerthia variegaticeps) (Doyle’s Delight Expedition, 1989), and <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (Doyle’s Delight Expedition, 1993; Little Quartz Ridge, Jones, 1997). Two Neotropical migrants - chuck-will's-widow (Caprimulgus carolinesis) and the warbling vireo (Vireo galvus) - were also recorded for the first time, in Columbia River Forest Reserve in 1992, and may be present in the higher altitude areas of Bladen Nature Reserve.|$|E
50|$|Leaftossers are small, plump, ground-dwelling {{birds with}} dark plumage and short legs and tails. The sexes {{are similar in}} the black-tailed leaftosser, and it grows to a length of about 18 cm. The beak is long and straight, and the lower {{mandible}} is turned up at its tip. The head and upper {{parts of the body}} are a deep brown, the rump is chestnut-brown and the tail black. The throat is white, the feathers being edged with brown which gives the throat a scaled appearance, {{and the rest of the}} underparts are dark brown. Some other species of leaftossers overlap its range but it can be distinguished by the white throat; the short-billed leaftosser (Sclerurus rufigularis) has a short beak and reddish throat; the <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (Sclerurus mexicanus) has a downwardly-curved beak and cinnamon throat; and the grey-throated leaftosser (Sclerurus albigularis) has a straight beak and a pale grey throat bordered by a cinnamon band.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tawny-throated</b> <b>leaftosser</b> is {{considered}} to be the sister species of the short-billed leaftosser (S. rufigularis). It might actually contain two species which are sympatric by range (though not by altitude) between eastern Panama and northern Colombia; the birds between Meta and Santander Departments (Colombia), including a population in the Serranía de las Quinchas discovered only on January 20, 2006, have not been identified as to subspecies yet. As regards scientific names, S. mexicanus would refer to the lowland birds, while the name of the Andean ones (which ironically would not include the subspecies andinus, essentially a lowland bird despite its name) would be S. obscurior. The status of the isolated Mata Atlântica population is also unclear; it might represent yet another species, which would be named S. bahiae, but it has been very little studied. A study of vocalizations published in 2017 proposes that as many as five species may be contained within S. mexicanus sensu stricto.|$|E
