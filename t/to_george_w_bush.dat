5|$|Jackson reluctantly {{supported}} Al Gore when {{he became}} the Democratic presidential nominee, saying Gore and his running mate Joe Lieberman were not liberal enough but that he supported Gore as the only alternative <b>to</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush.</b> Jackson criticized Lieberman and the campaign for emphasizing the importance of personal morality in American politicians. Jackson was still considered a likely appointee for United States Secretary of Education if Gore was elected.|$|E
5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power <b>to</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest <b>to</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.|$|E

25|$|Incumbent Mary Landrieu {{was elected}} in 1996 {{following}} a recount and was narrowly re-elected in 2002 in a runoff election. Since those elections, Democrats have had to endure the loss of some reliable voters because Hurricane Katrina dispersed many African-Americans from New Orleans, although the vast majority still live within Louisiana. The state has become more Republican over the past 12 years. Louisiana elected David Vitter in 2004, the state's first Republican senator since Reconstruction. And Louisianans elected Republican Bobby Jindal as the first Indian-American Governor in the country's history in 2007.

500|$|Following this, Gore shares anecdotes that {{inspired}} {{his interest in}} the issue, including his college education with early climate expert Roger Revelle at Harvard University, his sister's death from lung cancer and his young son's near-fatal car accident. Gore recalls a story from his grade-school years, where a fellow student asked his geography teacher about continental drift; in response, the teacher called the concept the [...] "most ridiculous thing [...] ever heard." [...] Gore ties this conclusion to the assumption that [...] "the Earth is so big, we can't possibly have any lasting, harmful impact on the Earth's environment." [...] For comic effect, Gore uses a clip from the Futurama episode [...] "Crimes of the Hot" [...] to describe the greenhouse effect. Gore refers to his loss <b>to</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> in the 2000 United States presidential election as a [...] "hard blow" [...] yet one which subsequently [...] "brought into clear focus, the mission [...] had been pursuing for all these years." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} several {{male and female}} models dressed up as {{soldiers}} on a fashion runway, wearing military garb and gas masks with one male model sports a shirt that reads [...] "Fashion Victim" [...] while it is inter-cut with scenes of Madonna singing {{in front of a}} black background. In the second chorus, middle-eastern children are seen walking on the runway, and being bullied by the soldier models. During the bridge, Madonna and her group prepare to enter the runway in a restroom, while she carves [...] "Protect Me" [...] on the partition of a stall and dances angrily with them to the song. The women also are seen dancing in front of surveillance cameras. When the rap section starts, Madonna is seen crashing into the show driving a Mini Cooper and pummel the photographers with an industrial-strength water hose, while rapping and dancing on top of the car with her gang. In the end of the video, Madonna frantically drives out of the runway into the amused audience, and pull a hand grenade with her teeth and then throws it <b>to</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> and the video ends with him using it to light up his cigar.|$|E
500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser <b>to</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability to get things done, to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E
