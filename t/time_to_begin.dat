5|$|At a {{young age}} Saint-Just had shown a fascination with literature, and during his stay at the {{reformatory}} he used his <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> writing a lengthy poem. He published it anonymously {{more than two years}} later, in May 1789, at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby added his own touch to the social tumult of the times with Organt, poem in twenty cantos. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy, relates the quest of young Antoine Organt. It extols the virtues of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence while blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, it gave a juvenile foreshadowing of his own political extremism. Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, it also made unmistakable attacks upon the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{attended}} the local Cap Coch school, leaving {{at the age}} of 12, as was usual at that <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> work in the Cwmpennar coal mine. He remained there until the mine was exhausted in 1905, when he moved to Mountain Ash to work at Nixon's Navigation Colliery. His ambition and intelligence were quickly recognised by his superiors, and he was encouraged to study mining engineering, at first locally in Aberdare and, in 1907, at the Royal College of Science in London. In 1908, with sponsorship from the Brecon Memorial College, he passed his matriculation and began studying for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at University College, Cardiff, with a view thereafter to entering the nonconformist ministry. However, Davies's religious beliefs were influenced by R. J. Campbell, a noted preacher who rejected much traditional Christian teaching and asserted that socialism was the practical expression of Christianity. Davies's association with such supposed heresies was unacceptable to the Brecon college, which withdrew its financial support.|$|E
5|$|Giordano {{appeared}} in 58 {{games for the}} Flames and scored 19 points before a shoulder injury ended his season. He required surgery {{to repair the damage}} suffered in a game against the Minnesota Wild. He recovered in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the 2009–10 season, but several new additions to Calgary's defensive corps left him concerned about his position with the team. Instead, he solidified his place on the roster with a career year; Giordano set personal highs in goals (11), points (30) and was +17 for the Flames. The Hockey News named him one of the most underrated players in the league, and he was invited to join Team Canada at the 2010 IIHF World Championship. Giordano led the team's defencemen with three goals in the tournament and added an assist in seven games.|$|E

5|$|Waldeck-Rousseau, {{named for}} the {{recently}} deceased Prime Minister of France, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, was ordered on 31 July 1905 and was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 16 June 1906. She was launched on 4 March 1908, and fitting out work was completed in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> sea trials in January 1911. While on her acceptance trials on 2 February, she struck a submerged object that bent her port propeller shaft and damaged the screw. Waldeck-Rousseau was completed in August; the ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France, but she entered service {{two years after the}} British battlecruiser , which rendered the armored cruiser obsolescent as a warship type. Her lengthy construction interfered with the scheduled keel-laying for the new predreadnought battleship Mirabeau, which could not be started until Waldeck-Rousseau was launched. After entering service the new cruiser was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E

Although Getty was impressive, the show's producers went with another actress. Getty came to Weiner's mind soon after when it became <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> casting of The Golden Girls.|$|E

500|$|In the Babylonian star catalogues, Triangulum, {{together}} with Gamma Andromedae, formed the constellation known as MULAPIN (...) [...] "The Plough".

The Plough was the first constellation of the [...] "Way of Enlil"—that is, the northernmost quarter of the Sun's path, which corresponds to the 45 days {{on either side of}} summer solstice.

500|$|Longstreet {{wanted to}} avoid {{personally}} ordering the charge by attempting to pass the mantle onto young Colonel Alexander, telling him that he should inform Pickett at the optimum <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the advance, based on his assessment that the Union artillery had been effectively silenced. Although he had insufficient information to accomplish this, Alexander eventually notified Pickett that he was running dangerously short of ammunition, sending the message [...] "If you are coming at all, come at once, or I cannot give you proper support, but the enemy's fire has not slackened at all. At least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself." [...] Pickett asked Longstreet, [...] "General, shall I advance?" [...] Longstreet's memoir recalled [...] "The effort to speak the order failed, and I could only indicate it by an affirmative bow." ...|$|E
500|$|With little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> rehearsing for the New York shows, the [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] single was rush-recorded in Los Angeles.

Phil Spector again co-produced, but as with the recording details for the sessions, the exact line-up of musicians {{is a matter of}} conjecture. According to Simon Leng, who consulted Klaus Voormann and Jim Horn for his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the line-up comprised Harrison, Leon Russell (piano), Horn (saxophones), Voormann (bass), Starr, Jim Keltner (both on drums) and Billy Preston (organ). Leng and Beatles author Bruce Spizer credit a [...] "horn section" [...] led by Jim Horn, which could include regular partner Chuck Findley and even the rest of the six-piece section, christened [...] "the Hollywood Horns", that would go on to perform in New York on 1 August.|$|E

2500|$|Edward G. Robinson {{was also}} {{reluctant}} {{to sign on}} {{for the role of}} Barton Keyes, but not for the same reasons as MacMurray and Stanwyck. Having been a star since Little Caesar in 1930, this role represented a step downward to the third lead. Robinson would later admit, [...] "At my age, it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> thinking of character roles, to slide into middle and old age with the same grace as that marvelous actor Lewis Stone". It also helped, as he freely admitted, that he would draw the same salary as the two leads, for fewer shooting days.

It was Powers' first film role since 1917 and his start to a [...] "second film career" [...] with many supporting roles until his death in 1955.|$|E

On July 14, after Williams hit three home runs and eight RBIs {{in the first game}} of a doubleheader, Lou Boudreau, inspired by Williams' consistent pull hitting to right field, created what would later be known as the Boudreau shift (also Williams shift) against Williams, having only one player {{on the left side of}} second base (the left fielder). Ignoring the shift, Williams walked twice and grounded out to second base. Also during 1946, the All-Star Game was held in Fenway Park. In the game, Williams homered in the fourth inning against Kirby Higbe, singled in a run in the fifth inning, singled in the seventh inning, and hit a three-run home run against Rip Sewell's notorious [...] "eephus pitch" [...] in the eighth inning to help the American League win 12 – 0.|$|E
