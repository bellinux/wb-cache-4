5|$|An HDMI {{cable is}} {{composed}} of four shielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs,</b> with impedance {{of the order of}} 100Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).|$|E
25|$|A star wiring pattern, {{where the}} wiring to each jack extends {{to a central}} {{distribution}} device, facilitates flexibility of services, problem identification, and better signal quality. This pattern has advantages to daisy chain loops. Installation tools, tips, and techniques for networked wiring systems using <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs,</b> coaxial cables, and connectors for each are available.|$|E
25|$|While coaxial cables can go longer {{distances}} and have better protection from EMI than <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs,</b> coaxial cables {{are harder to}} work with and more difficult to run from offices to the wiring closet. For these reasons, it is now generally being replaced with less expensive UTP cables or by fiber optic cables for more capacity.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{and overall}} shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual {{shielding}} using foil between the <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> sets, and also an outer foil and/or braided shielding. Common names: fully shielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> screened foiled <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> shielded foiled <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> screened shielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> shielded screened <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.|$|R

25|$|A {{variant of}} {{standard}} ribbon cable in which adjacent pairs of conductors are bonded and twisted together. The <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> are then lightly bonded {{to each other}} in a ribbon format. Periodically along the ribbon there are short sections with no twisting to enable connectors and PCB headers to be terminated using the usual ribbon cable IDC techniques.|$|E
25|$|Twisted-pair cabling {{was invented}} by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. By 1900, the entire American {{telephone}} line network was either twisted pair or open wire with transposition to guard against interference. Today, most {{of the millions of}} kilometres of <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> in the world are outdoor landlines, owned by telephone companies, used for voice service, and only handled or even seen by telephone workers.|$|E
25|$|For urban outdoor {{telephone}} cables containing {{hundreds or}} thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into small but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> that have different twist rates. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable. Pairs having the same twist rate within the cable can still experience some degree of crosstalk. Wire pairs are selected carefully to minimize crosstalk within a large cable.|$|E
50|$|The 8 {{position}} 8 contact (8P8C) connector is a modular connector {{commonly used}} to terminate <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> and multi-conductor flat cable. These connectors are commonly used for Ethernet over <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> registered jacks and other telephone applications, RS-232 serial using the EIA/TIA-561 and Yost standards, and other applications involving unshielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> shielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> and multi-conductor flat cable.|$|R

50|$|One or more <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs,</b> {{called a}} drop wire. The drop wires {{typically}} connect to a splice case, located {{in line for}} aerial cables, or in a small weather protected case for underground wiring, where the local cabling is connected to a secondary feeder line. These cables contain fifty or more <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{structured}} cabling, crosstalk {{can refer}} to electromagnetic interference from one unshielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> to another <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> normally running in parallel.|$|R
25|$|Deformation: <b>twisted</b> <b>pair's</b> {{susceptibility}} to electromagnetic interference greatly {{depends on the}} <b>pair</b> <b>twisting</b> schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation. As a result, <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cables usually have stringent requirements for maximum pulling tension as well as minimum bend radius.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} issue of the nearfield coupling of an unshielded twisted-wire pair on a nearby single wire. It introduces {{a discussion about the}} appropriate modeling method for predicting the induced current on the victim wire and proposes a cost-effective approach to deal with either ideal or nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> A nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> consists of a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> whose ends are left untwisted for connection to equipment. We show that the current distribution may follow a specific spatial distribution on the nearby wire. These coupling effects are evidenced through the analysis of an equivalent circuit under the low-frequency assumption. These behaviors are illustrated for the case of both an ideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> and a nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> For the latter, the ideal bifilar helix may be modeled by a simple equivalent model bifilar cable...|$|R

25|$|At {{frequencies}} up {{to about}} 1GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> This reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling. A <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.|$|R

50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>pair</b> wire is {{the most}} widely used medium for all telecommunication. Twisted-pair cabling consist of copper wires that are <b>twisted</b> into <b>pairs.</b> Ordinary {{telephone}} wires consist of two insulated copper wires <b>twisted</b> into <b>pairs.</b> Computer network cabling (wired Ethernet as defined by IEEE 802.3) consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 million bits per second to 10 billion bits per second. <b>Twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cabling comes in two forms: unshielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.|$|R
