5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep throat, is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the throat including the <b>tonsils</b> caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red <b>tonsils,</b> and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A headache, and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the correlation between oropharyngeal examination and objective palatine <b>tonsil</b> volume in snoring adults and verify the influence of the oropharyngeal anatomy, body mass index, age, and severity of obstructive sleep apnea on actual <b>tonsil</b> volume. In addition, we aimed to assess the influence of <b>tonsil</b> size on obstructive sleep apnea in adults. INTRODUCTION: Pharyngeal wall geometry is often altered in adults who have obstructive sleep apnea, and this might influence the findings of the oropharyngeal examination that, in turn, are the key factors when considering surgical management for this condition. Furthermore, the correlation between the actual <b>tonsil</b> volume and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea in adults is currently unknown. METHODS: We prospectively studied 130 patients with obstructive sleep apnea or primary snoring who underwent pharyngeal surgery with intraoperative measurement of <b>tonsil</b> volume. We compared <b>tonsil</b> volume with preoperative polysomnography, oropharyngeal examination, and anthropometric data. RESULTS: We found a significant correlation between actual <b>tonsil</b> volume and subjective <b>tonsil</b> grade. We also found a significant correlation between <b>tonsil</b> volume and the apnea-hypopnea index. Using a multivariate linear regression model, <b>tonsil</b> volume was found to be significantly correlated with age, body mass index, and oropharyngeal examination, but not with polysomnography. Clinically, only the rare <b>tonsil</b> grade IV was indicative of more severe obstructive sleep apnea. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong correlation between clinical <b>tonsil</b> grade and objective <b>tonsil</b> volume in snoring adults, and this correlation exists regardless of the presence or severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Pharyngeal tissue volume likely reflects the body mass index rather than obstructive sleep apnea severity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONBreast tumor {{metastasis}} to the <b>tonsil</b> {{is extremely}} rare. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 54 -year-old woman underwent resection of a breast malignant phyllodes tumor and later presented with metastasis to the lung {{and the left}} <b>tonsil.</b> She underwent left lower lobectomy and resection of the left tonsillar tumor. She subsequently developed undifferentiated carcinoma of the right <b>tonsil.</b> She underwent resection of the right tonsillar tumor and chemotherapy was started. The central venous catheter became infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, she died. DISCUSSIONTo {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first reported case of a phyllodes tumor metastasizing to the <b>tonsil.</b> Furthermore, morphological and immunohistochemical study revealed that the right tonsillar tumor was irrelevant to the phyllodes tumors. CONCLUSIONWe report a case of phyllodes tumor metastasis to the left <b>tonsil</b> which developed undifferentiated carcinoma in the other side of <b>tonsil</b> later. Breast tumor metastasis to the <b>tonsil</b> is rare but it should be considered as a possible diagnosis...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Love Letter, Kelly underwent emergency throat surgery in July 2011 to drain an abscess on one of his <b>tonsils.</b> He recovered, and in August, announced that his next album will be called Black Panties, a sexually charged album in the same vein of his 1993 debut album, 12 Play. However, he deviated from that plan in January 2012 by announcing Write Me Back as his next album. He recorded the album at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} <b>tonsils,</b> leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year, the cancer had spread into Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the <b>tonsils</b> (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his <b>tonsils.</b> Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E
5|$|As the 1936 season began, Hammond {{remained}} weak {{from the}} recent removal of his <b>tonsils.</b> Returning to cricket too soon, he was in poor form; he took a longer rest, which caused him to miss {{the first of three}} Tests against India. It was July before he felt fully well. In all first-class cricket that season, Hammond scored 2,107 runs, averaging 56.94, and took 41 wickets. In county cricket, Gloucestershire appointed a new captain, Dallas Page. Hammond had been offered the joint captaincy with Bev Lyon, conditional on his becoming assistant secretary at the club to enable him to play as an amateur, but declined for financial reasons. Hammond returned to the England side for the second Test, making 167, his first century in 28 innings, scoring quickly throughout. He was praised by Wisden for his control. Hammond continued to score heavily in the third Test, making 217 after being dropped twice early on. His highest score came in the last county match of the season, at Gloucestershire, which was Tom Goddard's benefit match. A difficult pitch meant that wickets tumbled on the first day, prompting fears of an early finish which would possibly lose money for Goddard. Hammond batted all of the second day, ensuring the match lasted the full three days, to score 317 {{out of a total of}} 485.|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{tumors of the}} palatine <b>tonsil</b> {{are usually}} lym-phomas in {{children}} and young adults and epidermoid cancers in older adults. 1 Cancer metastasizing to the palatine <b>tonsil</b> is rare.

40|$|<b>Tonsil</b> {{epithelium}} {{has been}} implicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pathogenesis, but its role in oral transmission remains controversial. To study characteristics of this tissue, which may influence susceptibility or resistance to HIV, we performed microarray analysis of the <b>tonsil</b> epithelium. Our data revealed that genes related to immune functions such as antibody production and antigen processing were increasingly expressed in <b>tonsil</b> compared with the epithelium of another oropharyngeal site, the gingival epithelium. Importantly, <b>tonsil</b> epithelium highly expressed genes associated with HIV entrapment and/or transmission, including the HIV co-receptor CXCR 4 and the potential HIV-binding molecules FcRγIII, complement receptor 2, and various complement components. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the increased presence of CXCR 4 in the <b>tonsil</b> epithelium compared with multiple oral epithelial sites, particularly in basal and parabasal layers. This increased expression of molecules involved in viral recognition, binding, and entry may favor virus-epithelium interactions in an environment with reduced innate antiviral mechanisms. Specifically, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, an innate molecule with anti-HIV activity, was minimal in the <b>tonsil</b> epithelium, in contrast to oral mucosa. Collectively, our data suggest that increased expression of molecules associated with HIV binding and entry coupled with decreased innate antiviral factors may render the <b>tonsil</b> a potential site for oral transmission...|$|R

5|$|Hammond's health {{remained}} poor at {{the start}} of the 1935 season. He developed septic tonsillitis which made it difficult for him to breathe, eat and sleep, and ultimately required an operation to remove his <b>tonsils</b> in early 1936. Hammond's form was indifferent and he believed it was his worst season. In first-class matches, he scored 2,616 runs (average 49.35) and took 60 wickets (average 27.26). He became the ninth player to reach 100 first-class centuries, emerging from a run of bad form against Somerset. Long a regular in the side, for the first time he captained the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. In the five-Test series against South Africa, a run of low scores again brought press speculation about his place in the national side. He did not pass fifty until the third Test, when he scored 63 and 87 not out, ending a run of 22 innings without a fifty, in which time he averaged 23.47 over 14 Tests. Hammond made two more fifties in the last two Tests, although they were insufficient to prevent England from losing 1–0, their third successive series defeat. He finished the series with 389 runs at an average of 64.83, but remained unsatisfied with his form.|$|E
5|$|Hutton's <b>tonsils</b> {{were removed}} {{before the start}} of the 1947 season but his poor health continued, forcing him to miss some games at the start of the season. Nevertheless, his form {{remained}} good and he scored four centuries in early matches. Yorkshire dropped to equal seventh in the County Championship, affected by the retirement of key players and the frequent loss of Hutton to representative cricket. In the Test matches Hutton did not initially score heavily. His highest innings after three Tests was only 24 runs, and critics called his place into question. He returned to form during the fourth Test, his first at Headingley, with a four-and-a-half-hour century on a difficult pitch for batting. Hutton scored 83 and 36 in the drawn final Test, and England won the series 3–0 with the other two games drawn. Hutton hit 344 runs in the Test series at an average of 44.00; in all first-class matches, he scored eleven centuries and totalled 2,585 runs at an average 64.62, although his achievements that season were overshadowed by those of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, who both broke the previous record for most runs scored in a season.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her <b>tonsils,</b> according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E

40|$|Antisera {{directed}} against complement (C 3) receptors on human <b>tonsil</b> cells were prepared and tested for {{their capacity to}} block specifically C 3 receptors on various types of human cells. The antisera were capable of blocking both membrane-bound and solubilized C 3 receptors of human <b>tonsil</b> cells. The C 3 b receptors of human erythrocytes and granulocytes were also blocked by the anti-C 3 receptor sera. Sheep erythrocyte rosette formation was not affected. IgG-EoxA rosette formation was only slightly reduced by the anti-C 3 receptor sera. Immunofluorescent staining with anti-C 3 receptor sera revealed only a faint or negative staining of T cells and a distinct staining of EAC-reactive <b>tonsil</b> cells, lymphocytic leukaemia cells, and granulocytes. Absorption of the antisera with human serum proteins, brain, thymus, liver, EU- 1 cell line cells, or trypsinized <b>tonsil</b> cells did not influence {{the capacity of the}} anti-C 3 receptor sera to inhibit C 3 receptors, whereas absorption with splenic tissue or <b>tonsil</b> cells completely removed the blocking activity of the anti-C 3 receptor sera. Absorption with human erythrocytes or kidney removed only the inhibitory effect of the antisera on C 3 b receptors of <b>tonsil</b> cells, human erythrocytes, and granulocytes, but not on C 3 d receptors of <b>tonsil</b> cells. The results indicate that (a) the antisera prepared with the described procedure contained significant amounts of antibody against C 3 receptors, (b) the receptors for C 3 b and C 3 d differe in antigenicity, and (c) the C 3 b receptors of <b>tonsil</b> cells, human erythrocytes, granulocytes, and probably glomerular cells have common antigenic sites...|$|R
