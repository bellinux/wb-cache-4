Look, picking potatoes is every bit as worthy as playing a guitar. But I can tell you that a man -with fine, sensitive fingers is not going to be able to make a go of picking potatoes: and I can also tell you that a man with fingers swollen from picking potatoes is not going to be able to play a guitar because he hasn't got the manual dexterity and he hasn't got the dedication. This is a profession like any other which you have to dedicate yourself to completely. It is an art of professionals." ...|$|E

In January 2016, Gunn revealed that he had chosen an additional Bowie song to appear in the film, but had cut the original scene it was featured in. The inclusion would have made Bowie the only artist to be featured on both mixtapes. With Bowie's death that month, Gunn hoped {{to find a way to}} include the chosen song somewhere else in the film as a [...] "fair and appropriate" [...] way to honor him, as Bowie was one of Gunn's idols. Gunn described the soundtrack as [...] "more diverse" [...] than that for the first Guardians, which had [...] "a bunch of songs <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> heard but didn’t know the name of the song–you didn’t know the name of the singer.

40|$|It {{is not a}} surprise, unfortunately, to {{say that}} Ireland and some other {{countries}} are {{in the grip of}} alcohol and drug addictions. Although drug misuse gets major headlines, quite rightly, it is the ongoing alcohol misuse that is ruining individuals and families. Alcohol action Ireland state; ”Over half of all Irish drinkers have a harmful pattern of drinking, that’s 4 in 10 women and 7 in 10 men who drink, which amounts to an estimated 1, 453, 250 adults “. If you are not shocked and worried by <b>that</b> statistic <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> should be. Drinking, and increasingly, drug use, is becoming the norm. Periodically TV programmes and newspapers will highlight this problem. Despite all the research and scholarly papers, things are getting worse. The use and abuse is, from my experience, down to ‘self-medication’ to try and manage stress, pressure and boredom. We use these drugs (including alcohol) as an avoidance strategy and a coping mechanism to help us get through the day and night...|$|R

Greeted by a standing ovation, she said: I was {{once upon a time}} a respectable member of this community. Respectable didn't necessarily mean more than I took a daily bath when I was sober, didn't spit except when I meant to, and mispronounced a few words of fancy French. Then suddenly, even before Senator Joe McCarthy reached for that rusty, poisoned ax, I and many others were no longer acceptable to the owners of this industry....They confronted the wild charges of Joe McCarthy with a force and courage of a bowl of mashed potatoes.

Caletti often cites her love for writing and reading stemming back to her early childhood. “My most memorable teacher was Rich Campe, my third-grade teacher at Fairlands Elementary in Pleasanton, California. Rich was a bona fide Bay Area hippie…We also {{did a lot of}} creative writing in his class.

It seemed to me that it must be some personal experience,--as if the writer had followed some dear friend there,--although it was with the unostentation and indefiniteness of true and delicate feeling. It impressed me so much that I went back there twice or thrice, and always seemed to move to the rhythm of that beautiful funeral march--and I am afraid, being a woman, that I wandered around among the graves as though I could find out who it was that had been sung so sweetly, and if it were man or woman.

"If {{the time}} should come, Harry, when the fortune of war may compel the king {{to retire from}} Oxford--which I trust may never be--I would then grant your request, for after your {{encounter}} with the officer who commanded the Roundheads here, {{it would not be}} safe for you to remain behind. But although you are too young {{to take part in the}} war, I may find you employment. After a council that was held yesterday at Oxford, I learned, from one in the king's secrets, that it was designed to send a messenger to London with papers of importance, and to keep up the communication with the king's friends in that city. There was some debate as to who should be chosen. In London, at the present time, all strangers are closely scrutinized. Every man is suspicious of his neighbor, and it is difficult to find one of sufficient trust whose person is unknown. Then I have thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> could well fulfill this important mission. A boy would be unsuspected, where a man's every movement would be watched. There is, of course, some danger attending the mission, and sharpness and readiness will be needed. You have shown that you possess these, by the manner in which you made your escape from London, and methinks that, did you offer, your services would be accepted.

There, I am so long getting under weigh that I shall never get into port if I don't steer a straight course. Now, my ideas and my wife's come to this: if you have got no friends you will have to take a lodging somewhere among strangers, and then it would be one of two things--you would either stop at home and mope by yourself, or you would go out, and maybe get into bad company. If I had not come across you I should have had to employ a clerk, and he would either have lived here with us or I should have had to pay him enough to keep house for himself. Now in fact you are a clerk; for though you are only here for six hours a week--you do all the work there is to do, and no clerk could do more. Well, we have got an attic upstairs which is not used, and if you like to come here and live with us, my wife and I will make you heartily welcome." ...|$|E

After necessary diagnostic test the final diagnosis was variant I of Kounis syndrome due to cefazolin and rocuronium. Ephinephrine is the cornerstone of treatment for anaphylaxis but should we use it if the anaphylactic reaction is also accompanied by myocardial ischemia? The answer is that we should not use it because myocardial ischemia in this syndrome is caused by vasospasm, so it would be more useful drugs such as nitroglycerin.
