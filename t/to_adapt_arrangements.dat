At {{the end of the}} 20th century more than 20 million foreigners were living in the European Economic Area. In 2001, about three quarters of the total EU population increase was due to net inward migration, and only one quarter to natural increase.

5000|$|Architectural {{determinism}} (also {{sometimes referred}} to as environmental determinism though that term has a broader meaning) is a theory employed in urbanism, sociology and environmental psychology which claims the built environment is the chief or even sole determinant of social behaviour. A. S. Baum defines the notion thus [...] "In its most extreme form, this position argues that the environment causes certain behaviours, denying any interaction between environment and behaviour. Architectural determinism poses the idea that people can <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> any <b>arrangement</b> of space and that behaviour in a given environment is caused entirely by the characteristics of the environment." ...|$|R

40|$|A spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} was {{integrated in}} a vertical furnace for {{measurement and control}} during chemical vapor deposition and thermal oxidation processes. The major goal of this activity was <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> the ellipsometer <b>arrangement</b> <b>to</b> the furnace geometry with a minimum impact on the furnace process performance. Modifications in the furnace geometry were restricted as far as possible, {{to show that a}} fast integration in existing industrial equipment with minor costs can be done. This aim led to a novel beam-guiding system. This setup has been used for the in situ characterization of polysilicon formation, inside the vertical furnace during high temperature processes. The polysilicon-on-oxide structures were modeled using the Bruggeman effective-medium approximation (B-EMA). The crystallization process of amorphous silicon layers during annealing at 600 °C has been monitored. Layer thickness and the degree of crystallinity can be obtained simultaneously. The crystallinity can be described in the optical model using a 'mixture' of amorphous silicon and single-crystalline silicon in the B-EMA...|$|R
40|$|Understanding American constitutionalism can be {{advanced}} by distinguishing three matrices of its peculiar traits. The {{first is the}} character of political institutions whose roots lie deeply inpre-modern forms of authority. The pivotal role of the Constitution {{in the life of}} the nation, the vital energies of judicial review, and many other hallmarks of American constitutionalism are all related to this first source. The second matrix is the distinctive position of the constitutive docum. ent in a culture of predominantly judge-made law. Authoritative t~~xts and judicial decisions vie for pride of place, and explain why so many issues of constitutional law elude conventional classificatory schemes. The third matrix is the need <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> late eighteenth-century <b>arrangements</b> reflected in the Constitution to altered social needs and understandings. Many intense controversies in contemporary constitutional discourse are related to methods of this aggiornamento. I shall organize my report around these three matrices, devoting to each a separute section, and try to demonstrate how they illuminate distinctive aspects of American constitutionalism. Before I close, I shall then discuss some challenges to American constitutionalism in our times. Foremost in my mind here will be the problem of adjusting an apparatus devised to contain the government to a time when decisive action is sometimes expected from the State...|$|R

40|$|Many New Zealanders {{are taking}} part in projects, {{independently}} or in partnership with local or central government agencies, to conserve the environment for future generations and protect our economic, social, and cultural well-being. Some of these projects are co-governed. Policies on, and approaches to, co-governance vary. Most importantly, successful co-governance relies on effective relationships. All parties to a relationship need to value it and prioritise building an effective relationship. This takes time and commitment. Building and maintaining mutual trust and respect needs constant attention to achieve good environmental outcomes. This report identifies some principles to consider when setting up and maintaining effective co-governance arrangements. The principles are: • build and maintain a shared understanding of what everyone is trying to achieve; • build the structures, processes, and understanding about how people will work together; • involve {{people who have the}} right experience and capacity; • be accountable and transparent about performance, achievements, and challenges; and • plan for financial sustainability and adapt as circumstances change. Good environmental outcomes can take time to achieve. Governance arrangements and participants will change. People need to be flexible and willing <b>to</b> <b>adapt,</b> and co-governance <b>arrangements</b> should be reviewed {{from time to time to}} ensure that they remain fit for purpose. This report also includes case studies of how co-governance has enabled six environmental projects to help achieve their goals...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{evidence}} for cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecules <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> superlattice <b>arrangements</b> in fluid lipid bilayers has been presented. Whether superlattice arrangements exist in other biologically relevant lipid membranes, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) /PC, is still speculative. In this study, we {{have examined the}} physical properties of fluid 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-PC (POPC) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-PE (POPE) binary mixtures {{as a function of}} the POPE mole fraction (X(PE)) using fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. At 30 degrees C, i. e., above the Tm of POPE and POPC, deviations, or dips, as well as local data scattering in the excimer-to-monomer fluorescence intensity ratio of intramolecular excimer forming dipyrenylphosphatidylcholine probe in POPE/POPC mixtures were detected at X(PE) approximately 0. 04, 0. 11, 0. 16, 0. 26, 0. 33, 0. 51, 0. 66, 0. 75, 0. 82, 0. 91, and 0. 94. The above critical values of X(PE) coincide (within +/- 0. 03) with the critical mole fractions X(HX,PE) or X(R,PE) predicted by a headgroup superlattice model, which assumes that the lipid headgroups form hexagonal or rectangular superlattice, respectively, in the bilayer. Other spectroscopic data, generalized polarization of Laurdan and infrared carbonyl and phosphate stretching frequency, were also collected. Similar agreements between some of the observed critical values of X(PE) from these data and the X(HX,PE) or X(R,PE) values were also found. However, all techniques yielded critical values of X(PE) (e. g., 0. 42 and 0. 58) that cannot be explained by the present headgroup superlattice model. The effective cross-sectional area of the PE headgroup is smaller than that of the acyl chains. Hence, the relief of "packing frustration" of PE in the presence of PC (larger headgroup than PE) may be one of the major mechanisms in driving the PE and PC components to superlattice-like lateral distributions in the bilayer. We propose that headgroup superlattices may play a significant role in the regulation of membrane lipid compositions in cells...|$|R
40|$|Networks {{have come}} to occupy a key {{position}} in the strategic armoury of the government, business and community sectors and now have impact on {{a broad array of}} policy and management arenas. An emphasis on relationships, trust and mutuality mean that networks function on a different operating logic to the conventional processes of government and business. It is therefore important that organizational members of networks are able to adopt the skills and culture necessary to operate successfully under these distinctive kinds of arrangements. Because networks function from a different operational logic to traditional bureaucracies, public sector organizations may experience difficulties in <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> networked <b>arrangements.</b> Networks are formed to address a variety of social problems or meet capability gaps within organizations. As such they are often under pressure to quickly produce measurable outcomes and need to form rapidly and come to full operation quickly. This paper presents a theoretical exploration of how diverse types of networks are required for different management and policy situations and draws on a set of public sector case studies to understand/demonstrate how these various types of networked arrangements may be ‘turbo-charged’ so that they more quickly adopt the characteristics necessary to deliver required outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the Special Volume on sustainable and responsible supply chain governance. As globalized supply chains cross multiple regulatory borders, the firms {{involved in these}} chains come under increasing pressure from consumers, NGOs and governments {{to accept responsibility for}} social and environmental matters beyond their immediate organizational boundaries. Governance arrangements for global supply chains are therefore increasingly faced with sustainability requirements of production and consumption. Our primary objectives for this introductory paper are to explore the governance challenges that globalized supply chains and networks face in becoming sustainable and responsible, and thence to identify opportunities for promoting sustainable and responsible governance. In doing so, we draw on 16 articles published in this Special Volume of the Journal of Cleaner Production as well as upon the broader sustainable supply chain governance literature. We argue that the border-crossing nature of global supply chains comes with six major challenges (or gaps) in sustainability governance and that firms and others attempt to address these using a range of tools including eco-labels, codes of conduct, auditing procedures, product information systems, procurement guidelines, and eco-branding. However, these tools are not sufficient, by themselves, to bridge the geographical, informational, communication, compliance, power and legitimacy gaps that challenge sustainable global chains. What else is required? The articles in this Special Volume suggest that coalition and institution building on a broader scale is essential through, for example, the development of inclusive multi-stakeholder coalitions; flexibility <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> global governance <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> local social and ecological contexts of production and consumption; supplementing effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms with education and other programs to build compliance capacity; and integration of reflexive learning to improve governance arrangements over time...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} Doukhobor {{homestead}} crisis, from {{the granting of}} a land reserve to the Doukhobor settlers in 1898, to the final cancellation of their homestead entries in 1907. The initial terms of the Doukhobor immigration, and the settlement of the Doukhobors on the Saskatchewan lands are studied. The separate issues of the homestead crisis, homestead entry (1900 - 1902), {{the dissolution of the}} reserve (1904), the cultivation issue (1905) and naturalization (1906), are examined chronologically. It is a study of Dominion land policy toward settlers, whose peculiarities extended to land-holding. The issues comprising the homestead crisis are examined within the context of general trends in Canadian imigration and land settlement. In 1907, the Doukhobors were compelled <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> their land-holding <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> the requirements of federal land policy. This was an attempt to draw the Doukhobors into the Canadian model of land ownership. This work also examines the homestead crisis from the Doukhobor perspective. For almost ten years, the Doukhobors tried to resolve the conflict that existed between Canadian homestead law and their particular faith. In 1907, their personal attitudes toward land-holding were clarified and the conflict was resolved. The Doukhobors' migration to British Columbia proved that with regard to property-holding the measures of the federal Lands Branch had largely failed. Resource materials for this thesis are drawn largely from the P. A. C., R. G. 15, Department of the Interior Dominion Land Files, file # 494483, P. A. C., R. G. 76, Records of the Superintendent of Immigration, the accounts of Doukhobor settlement by both Russians and Doukhobors (especially V.
