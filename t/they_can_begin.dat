Before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} a {{periphery}} country to industrialize, it must first undergo proto-industrialization. In this stage, a market-based economy begins to form, normally in rural areas, using agricultural products. Proto-industrialization also helps to organize the rural market in these country and allows for them to become more capitalistic. Finally, once these countries develop this style of economy, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to build factories and machines.|$|E
25|$|These {{patterns}} are formed from a {{phenomenon known as}} a Kármán vortex which is named after the engineer and fluid dynamicist Theodore von Kármán,. When wind driven clouds are forced through a mountain range, or when ocean wind driven clouds encounter a high elevation island, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to circle the mountain or high land mass. They can form at any altitude in the troposphere and are not restricted to any particular cloud type.|$|E

25|$|Seven {{criteria}} {{measure the}} usability {{of different types}} of public transport and its overall appeal, although they overlap somewhat. The criteria are speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, timeliness and directness. Speed is calculated from total journey time including transfers. Proximity means how far passengers must walk or otherwise travel before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> the public transport leg of their journey and how close it leaves them to their desired destination. Timeliness is how long they must wait for the vehicle. Directness records how far a journey using public transport deviates from the shortest route.|$|E
25|$|After the {{synaptic}} vesicles initially dock, {{they must}} be primed before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> fusion. Priming prepares the synaptic vesicle {{so that they are}} able to fuse rapidly in response to a calcium influx. This priming step is thought to involve the formation of partially assembled SNARE complexes. The proteins Munc13, RIM, and RIM-BP participate in this event. Munc13 is thought to stimulate the change of the t-SNARE syntaxin from a closed conformation to an open conformation, which stimulates the assembly of v-SNARE /t-SNARE complexes. RIM also appears to regulate priming, but is not essential for the step.|$|E
25|$|The Rawk {{is a large}} boulder {{donated by}} members of Alpha Phi Omega in 1973 and painted nearly every day by {{students}}, who {{use it as a}} giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of these emotions, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>begin</b> to form once an {{individual}} has the capacity to self-evaluate their own actions. If the individual decides that they have caused a situation to occur, they then must decide if the situation was a success or a failure based on the social norms they have accrued, then attach the appropriate self-conscious feeling (Weiner, 1986). This is a complex cognitive skill, one that takes time to master.|$|R
30|$|The {{insights}} {{contained in}} Dataset Two and analyzed here {{provide a basis}} from which {{to argue that the}} initial impetus provided by generic MDGs and EFA has resulted in, or supported, the establishment of unique, country-specific structures (or, at least, ideas) that can now be strengthened to assist countries in exploring innovative, localized methods by which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> really <b>begin</b> to protect and the needs and rights of young children, within the possibilities and confines of their own unique contexts.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the sharing of household chores, certain cultures expect adolescents to share in their family's financial responsibilities. According to family economic and financial education specialists, adolescents develop sound money management skills through the practices of saving and spending money, {{as well as through}} planning ahead for future economic goals. Differences between families in the distribution of financial responsibilities or provision of allowance may reflect various social background circumstances and intrafamilial processes, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values, {{as well as by the}} business sector and market economy of a given society. For instance, in many developing countries it is common for children to attend fewer years of formal schooling so that, when they reach adolescence, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> working.|$|E
25|$|Ira Shor, a {{professor}} at the City University of New York, provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes in looking at the use of Freirean teaching methods {{in the context of the}} everyday life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum of the classroom must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states that students have previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes of the classroom, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to envision and strive for something different for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Plants can be {{propagated}} by seed, cuttings, {{and tissue}} culture. Seeds are usually sown on damp chopped Sphagnum moss, or on sterile {{plant tissue culture}} media once they have been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or perlite {{has been used for}} germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp Sphagnum moss in a plastic bag or tank with high humidity and moderate light. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. Tissue culture is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists at reasonable prices. Nepenthes species are considered threatened or endangered plants and all of the are listed in CITES appendices 2, with the exception of N. rajah and N. khasiana which are listed in CITES appendix 1.|$|E

25|$|When the men {{return to}} the village with the {{collected}} trash, usually their families are waiting for them so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables. The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage. First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different types of plastic are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories. Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a marginal profit.|$|E

500|$|From Dust has {{the option}} of two main game modes, one being the Story mode, the other a Challenge mode.

By helping the tribe to find the different totems scattered on a map, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> constructing their village next to the totem. Players can also send tribespeople to look for magical stones, which will grant them the ability to manipulate the world, by repelling water and fire for example. When the tribe successfully builds villages next to every totem, a portal will open and the player can proceed into the next map. These maps become more and more challenging as players progress. New elements, such as trees that erupt in fire, and plants that explode, are introduced in later levels.|$|E
500|$|The group {{expressed}} its {{belief that}} the faster that they accomplish independence, the faster that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> associating with other Latin American nations and consolidate efforts with its counterparts. Believing that the local and federal governments had [...] "extreme repressive and oppressive economic measures against the people" [...] to unprecedented levels, Guasábara warned that privatization of services would bring [...] "a raise in costs" [...] and [...] "meager salaries", also citing that constitutional rights were being violated by the Fortuño administration noting that under Rivera Schatz the general public {{was not allowed to}} openly protest at the Senate of Puerto Rico. The EPB derided the government's raise of the UPR's tuition and the withdrawal of funds for cultural organizations. It also expressed support to those opposing the Via Verde project, stating that it would [...] "destroy the environment [...] endanger human life and property". All of these conditions convinced the Macheteros that the conditions for a public revolt were being formed, citing that they would [...] "do everything in their power to convince the people {{that there is a need}} to defend themselves". Guasábara admitted that the organization was receiving information concerning military and political strategies that the United States intended to enact in Puerto Rico and that they employ it to remain elusive and to prepare counter measures, only making a portion of it public, but refused to reveal their sources. When questioned about the possibility of reopening a line of inquiry with the Catholic Church (an initiative abandoned in 2005 after the death of Ojeda Ríos), the officer said that the EPB is open [...] "to chat [...] exchange ideas", but that they would not abandon armed resistance.|$|E

The first four are members of the Reserve JLA that had been put together by a program created by Batman that automatically activates after the League vanishes into the past with the aid of the Manitou Raven of their time. Aquaman is freed from his prison in the pool, and Zatanna enhances his powers so that he can now control the entire ocean as a water wraith. With this power, Aquaman is able to sever Gamemnae's connection to the city by sinking it under the sea again.
