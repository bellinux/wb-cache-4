5|$|<b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> {{connected}} to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in {{the centre of}} the building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock {{on the front of the}} building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of}} the planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

25|$|Although formal {{portraiture}} was not Sorolla's {{genre of}} preference, because it tended to restrict his creative appetites and could reflect {{his lack of}} interest in his subjects, the acceptance of portrait commissions proved profitable, and the portrayal of his family was irresistible. Sometimes the influence of Velázquez was uppermost, as in My Family (1901), a reference to Las Meninas which grouped his wife and children in the foreground, the painter reflected, at work, in a distant mirror. At other times the desire to compete with his friend John Singer Sargent was evident, as in Portrait of Mrs. Ira Nelson Morris and her children (1911). A series of portraits produced in the United States in 1909, commissioned through the Hispanic Society of America, was capped by the Portrait of Mr. Taft, President of the United States, This portrait, which was painted at <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>is</b> on permanent display at the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|The neoclassical presidential mansion, the White House in Washington, was {{inspired}} by Irish Palladianism. Both Castle Coole and Richard Cassel's Leinster House in Dublin claim to have inspired the architect James Hoban, who designed the executive mansion, built between 1792 and 1800. Hoban, born in Callan, County Kilkenny, in 1762, studied architecture in Dublin, where Leinster House (built c. 1747) {{was one of the}} finest buildings at the time. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> more neoclassical than Palladian; particularly the South façade, which closely resembles James Wyatt's 1790 design for Castle Coole, also in Ireland. Castle Coole is, {{in the words of the}} architectural commentator Gervase Jackson-Stops, [...] "A culmination of the Palladian traditions, yet strictly neoclassical in its chaste ornament and noble austerity." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> {{also said}} to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal {{government}} in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, [...] "I'm Mr. Burns." [...] The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and sea force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed {{to be one of those}} who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on the front door to seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{scenes of}} <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>were</b> in fact filmed at Hylands House in Chelmsford, Essex, England, {{because of its}} resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Blueprints of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>were</b> also {{used to create a}} digital replica, which helped make the exterior scenes look authentic. These blueprints caused the director some trouble when traveling to Washington, D.C., as his suitcase also contained source material about the Oval Office, among other things. He did make it to Washington, D.C.|$|R

A representative of the dissenting Democrats is brought in to negotiate a deal with Toby and Sam. Meanwhile, Josh is meeting with Indiana Governor Jack Buckland (Tighe) {{to talk him out of}} a potential primary challenge against Bartlet. Leo is at this point getting exasperated by their own partisans taking advantage of the administration's weakness due to the impending hearings over the president's concealment of his MS. He tells Josh to [...] "throw an elbow" [...] and threaten to leak the fact that Buckland tried to blackmail the president. In the end, Josh ends up striking a compromise, while it is Toby and Sam who [...] "throw an elbow" [...] by turning down Democratic Congressman Kimble and offering the same deal to moderate Republican Congressman Robert Royce instead.|$|E
