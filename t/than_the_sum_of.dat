5|$|Paley {{considers}} how {{the whole}} of a system is more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> its parts. This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement was more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can be larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> {{the other two}} surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of {{a solution to the}} Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E

5000|$|John Stuart Mill {{outlined}} {{his version}} of emergentism in System of Logic (1843). Mill argued that the properties of some physical systems, {{such as those in}} which dynamic forces combine to produce simple motions, are subject to a law of nature he called the [...] "Composition of Causes". According to Mill, emergent properties are not subject to this law, but instead amount to more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties of their parts.|$|R

40|$|The hydrolyzing {{actions of}} various {{preparations}} {{of the adult}} eel were studied on ten esters in the usual way. The results are presented {{in the form of}} curves for the relative actions and in a table for the absolute actions obtained in one complete experiment. The separation of the enzyme material in some cases into an active portion and a co-enzyme, the mixture showing greater actions on some esters <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual actions, is described and discussed...|$|R
25|$|The G8 summits {{during the}} 21st century have {{inspired}} widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> its parts, elevating the participants, {{the issues and}} the venue as focal points for activist pressure.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol-water {{mixtures}} {{have less}} volume <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> their individual components at the given fractions. Mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only 1.92 volumes of mixture. Mixing ethanol and water is exothermic, {{with up to}} 777J/mol being released at 298K.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{qualification}} of {{an armed}} conflict determines which rules of {{international humanitarian law}} apply to {{the conduct of the}} parties during that conflict. In general, the normative framework applicable to international conflicts is broader and more detailed <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> rules that apply in conflicts not of an international character.|$|E
25|$|The partial {{differences}} {{method is}} different from other vertical subtraction methods because no borrowing or carrying takes place. In their place, one places plus or minus signs {{depending on whether the}} minuend is greater or smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> subtrahend. <b>The</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> partial differences is the total difference.|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{relationship}} between the privatization of a public firm and government preferences for tax revenue in a Stackelberg duopoly with the public firm as the leader. We assume that the government payoff is given by a weighted <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> tax revenue and <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> consumer and producer surplus. We get that if the government puts a sufficiently larger weight on tax revenue <b>than</b> on <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> both surpluses, it will not privatize the public firm. In contrast, if the government puts a moderately larger weight on tax revenue <b>than</b> on <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> both surpluses, it will privatize the public firm. ESEIG/IP...|$|R

25|$|The {{triangle}} inequality {{can be extended}} by mathematical induction to arbitrary polygonal paths, showing that the total length of such a path is {{no less than the}} length of the straight line between its endpoints. Consequently, the length of any polygon side is always less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> the other polygon side lengths.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin and {{doxycycline}} {{can have}} a synergistic effect when combined and kill bacteria (E. coli) with a higher potency <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> the two drugs together. This synergistic relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 {{combination of the two}} drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately.|$|E
25|$|The {{converse}} of {{the triangle}} inequality theorem is also true: if three real numbers are such that each is less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> the others, then there exists a triangle with these numbers as its side lengths and with positive area; and if one number equals {{the sum of the}} other two, there exists a degenerate triangle (i.e., with zero area) with these numbers as its side lengths.|$|E
5000|$|Synergy is the {{creation}} of a whole that is greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> simple <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> its parts. <b>The</b> term synergy comes from the Attic Greek word συνεργία [...] from , , meaning [...] "working together".|$|R

25|$|Gloucestershire {{was very}} {{successful}} in one-day cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s winning several titles under the captaincy of Mark Alleyne and coaching of John Bracewell. The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> its parts, boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{taste of}} jianbing is also {{major reason for}} its popularity. Alisa Grandy, a western food vendor who serves jianbing in Portland, {{describes}} Jianbing’s taste as fantastic and special because the combination of different ordinary ingredients makes the taste greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> them. In the book Food and Chinese Culture: Essays on Popular Cuisine, it is described that the look and smell of Jianbing Guozi {{are as good as}} its taste, and it tastes better when serving with green garlic and fermented flour sauce with the sweetness of its crispy layer.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{argues that}} states of affairs are {{distinct}} things in ontology {{because they are}} more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> their parts. If some particular a has a non-symmetric relation R to another particular b, then R (a, b) differs from R (b, a). It may be the case that R (a, b) obtains in the world but R (b, a) does not. Without states of affairs instantiating the particulars and universals (including relations), we cannot account for the truth of the one case and the falsity of the other.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the {{original}} {{meaning of the}} adjective is retained, but the whole compound still means something more specific <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> the elements. For example, savanyú káposzta, lit. ’sour cabbage’, actually ’sauerkraut’, {{is more than a}} cabbage that tastes sour: it means a type of pickled food, yet it is written with a space. On the other hand, mobiltelefon ’mobile phone’ is written in one word, although it is actually a telephone that is mobile – writing in one word may be justified by the different technology, as distinguished from a cordless telephone, which is also portable.|$|E
25|$|It has {{not been}} contested that {{cardiovascular}} risk factors tend to cluster together; the matter of contention has been the assertion that the metabolic syndrome is anything more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> its constituent parts. Phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, represented by variation in metabolic syndrome factor combinations among individuals with metabolic syndrome) has fueled that debate. However, more recent evidence suggests that common triggers (for example, excessive sugar-intake in the environment of overabundant food) {{can contribute to the}} development of multiple metabolic abnormalities at the same time, supporting the commonality of the energy utilization and storage pathways in metabolic syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the total image was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) {{are just as important}} as the whole. Yet, the total image, greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind of the beholder. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{appears to}} have been funded by ad hoc donations of alms, not by an endowment, as in 1291 the whole property within in the parish of St. Benet Fink was not worth more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> small <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> 8 shillings per annum.|$|R
