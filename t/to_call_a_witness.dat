5000|$|Bromley {{presided over}} the trials {{of a number of}} those implicated in Wyatt's rebellion. On 17 April 1554 Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and others were indicted for a plot and treason at Baynard's Castle on 23 November 1553, and for a rising and march towards London with Sir Henry Isley and two {{thousand}} men. Bromley presided at the trial, and allowed the prisoner such unusual freedom of speech as to provoke complaints from the queen's attorney, and threats of retiring from the prosecution. Yet Bromley was not throughout impartial, but even refused the prisoner leave <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness,</b> though he was in court, and denied him inspection of a statute on which he relied. His summing up was so defective, 'for want of memory or goodwill,' that the prisoner supplied its defects, {{as if he had been}} an uninterested spectator. Yet the prisoner was acquitted: so much to Mary's annoyance that the jury were punished for their verdict.

40|$|The chief {{practical}} difficulty today, as always, lies in {{the particular}} application of a mass of evidentiary rules, in determining the bearing of various principles upon a given evidentiary issue of fact here and now. Nowhere has this situation continued truer than with reference to rules about evidentiary spoliation. 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, after reading all there is on the subject in a recent voluminous text-book, one may well be bewildered, owing to the collection of crude, inadvertent and contradictory material. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 As a result, the 2 ̆ 2 request to charge which more frequently than any other is made in improper form is that dealing with the failure <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The importance of a party 2 ̆ 7 s failure <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> differs in each individual case according to its background.

Any rule boldly attempting to alter reality must prove sterile and affirmatively obstructive...|$|E

Lord Justice Keene said that the new evidence did not raise [...] "a reasonable doubt as {{to the safety of}} this conviction", saying that the geological evidence was only a small element of the [...] "strong circumstantial case against the applicant". The new evidence presented by geologist Andrew Moncrief concerned the rock found with the body, said to have been from the wall outside the Parks' house. Moncrief argued that the rock was [...] "indistinguishable" [...] from others in the area, and therefore [...] "meaningless".|$|R
25|$|Investigative {{records show}} that Rowe had twice failed {{polygraph}} tests when questioned as to his possible involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and two separate, non-fatal explosions.

5000|$|The United Irishmen {{represented}} by McNally at their trials were invariably convicted and McNally was {{paid by the}} crown for passing the secrets of their defence to the prosecution. During the trial of Emmet, McNally provided details of the defence's strategy to the crown and conducted his client's case {{in a way that}} would assist the prosecution. For example, three days before the trial he assured the authorities that Emmet [...] "does not intend <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> single <b>witness,</b> nor <b>to</b> trouble any witness for the Crown with a cross-examination, unless they misrepresent facts… He will not controvert the charge by <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> single witness". For his assistance to the prosecution in Emmet's case, he was paid a bonus of £200, on top of his pension, half of which was paid five days before the trial.|$|R
5000|$|The defense {{strategy}} was to impeach Lloyd's testimony. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated {{on the day of}} Lincoln's death (April 14), implying that he could not have remembered with clarity what happened that day. Surratt's chief attorney, Reverdy Johnson, asserted repeatedly that Lloyd was <b>an</b> unreliable <b>witness,</b> and that the evidence against Mary Surratt was entirely circumstantial. The only evidence linking Surratt to the conspiracy to kill Lincoln, he said, came from Lloyd and Weichmann, and neither man was telling the truth (he said). Lloyd's testimony was coerced, he claimed. The government's case was hindered by its failure <b>to</b> <b>call</b> as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> the man who shared Lloyd's carriage when he talked with Mrs. Surratt (an individual who could have verified Lloyd's version of the [...] "shooting irons" [...] story).|$|R
50|$|In November 2009, Dixon {{was tried}} for three counts of felony theft, three counts of {{misdemeanor}} embezzlement/misappropriation, {{and a single}} count of misconduct of office. The trial began on November 10, 2009, with Arnold M. Weiner serving as lead counsel. During the trial, two counts (one theft charge and one embezzlement/misappropriation charge) were dropped when prosecutors declined <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> key <b>witness.</b> On December 1, 2009, after seven days of deliberations, the jury returned verdicts on {{four of the five}} remaining counts. Dixon was found not guilty of the two felony theft charges, and one count of misconduct of office. She was found guilty on one misdemeanor embezzlement charge relating to her use of over $600 worth of retail store gift cards that were intended to be distributed to needy families. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision regarding the final charge of misdemeanor embezzlement.|$|R
5000|$|A {{report on}} September 3, 2013, {{noted that the}} {{corruption}} trial of Spagnolini and Orsi was set to resume within the month, “with defense lawyers prepared <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> international <b>witness</b> list of top government officials and industry leaders.” It was noted that possible defense witnesses included Ratan Tata, {{the former chairman of}} India's Tata Group; Indian defense minister A.K. Antony; and former UK defense secretary Geoffrey Hoon. The defense was “expected to argue that Orsi and Spagnolini did nothing outside the normal scope of accepted business practices in India in winning the contract.” A report noted that “AgustaWestland could be blacklisted by the Indian government under terms of its new and strict anti-corruption laws if Orsi and Spagnolini are convicted” and that India had “begun its own inquiry into the matter.” This practically ended the so called [...] "VVIP Chopper Deal" [...] forever.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{samples were}} sent to other Abrams practitioners, and a few found {{themselves}} facing fraud charges in court. In a case in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Abrams was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>witness.</b> Abrams did not attend court, because he died of pneumonia at age 62 shortly before the trial began in January 1924. After his death, investigators with the Food and Drug Administration opened some of the doctor's boxes. One produced a magnetic field, similar to a doorbell; another was a low-powered radio wave transmitter.|$|R
25|$|Gravano {{had been}} {{consulting}} a hypnotist named Halpern {{to deal with}} fears he had, and Gotti's lawyers wanted <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Halpern as <b>a</b> <b>witness,</b> but the judge refused. Gravano had told Halpern he was deathly afraid of going to prison. Gotti informed Gravano {{he would not be}} allowed to converse with his lawyers unless Gotti was present. Gravano claimed Gotti's defense to consist of Gotti's lawyers portraying Gotti as a peace-loving boss falling all over himself to restrain the kill-crazy Gravano, resulting in a conviction for Gravano and an acquittal for Gotti.|$|R
2500|$|Ferguson {{originally}} {{sought to}} question {{himself on the}} witness stand, but ultimately did not do so. He told the judge and media outlets he intended <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>witnesses</b> that would prove his innocence, including a ballistic expert, a handwriting expert and two regular eyewitnesses, but that they were afraid {{to come forward and}} take the stand. Ultimately, he did not call any of the witnesses. He also told Judge Belfi of an alleged conspiracy by the Jewish Defense League to kill him in prison if he was convicted. He said the prison slaying of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was [...] "set up as a prelude against me".|$|R
50|$|The Kansas Supreme Court {{reversed}} the verdict, and {{ruled that the}} trial court erred in permitting prosecutors <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Welner as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> because <b>an</b> intoxication defense was not a mental health defense. In the court’s opinion, the error required a new trial because Welner’s testimony included a detailed accounting of Cheever’s actions in his own words, and was, “extensive and devastating.” In a rare outcome, The United States Supreme Court then unanimously {{reversed the}} Kansas Supreme Court, ruling that an intoxication defense, when raised by a defendant, waived a Fifth Amendment protection, that prosecutors had <b>a</b> right <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Welner in rebuttal, and reinstated the verdict and death sentence.|$|R
5000|$|The Marshall Court {{had held}} that it lacked the {{jurisdiction}} to consider writs of error to the circuit courts in criminal cases. The Taney Court {{had not heard}} any such cases. But, in Blyew v. United States (1871), the Court heard a writ of error from a criminal action removed to the circuit court under the criminal rights removal provision. The opinion in Blyew does not discuss the jurisdictional question, but the reporter does note that: [...] "Some discussion not material to be reported, was also had at the bar by the counsel on both sides, {{as to whether the}} case was properly brought here by writ of error [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 had explicitly authorized appeals in removed cases. Over the dissent of Justices Bradley and Swayne, the Court held that civil rights removal was improper {{on the grounds that the}} criminal defendant wished <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> African-American <b>witness</b> who were regarded as incompetent to testify under state law.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 July, {{the defence}} team {{submitted}} an {{application to the}} court <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> additional <b>witness,</b> Nyunt Maung Shein, a Burmese foreign ministry official. Final arguments were presented for Yettaw, Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma. The morning session was attended by diplomats from Australia, Japan, Singapore, the United States, the Philippines and Malaysia, while in the afternoon only US Consul Colin Furst was in attendance. The final defence arguments, including a 15-minute statement from Yettaw, concluded 28 July. Again, diplomats from the US, Japan, Singapore and Thailand were present. The Court announced the verdicts would be made 31 July. Officials then notified shops in the vicinity to be closed 31 July. Two police battalions also arrived to support the already existing security forces. However, on 31 July judges Thaung Nyunt and Nyi Nyi Soe, citing an undisclosed problem with the legal procedures, adjourned the trial until 11 August, {{three days after the}} anniversary of the 8888 Uprising. After the announcement, Yettaw moved about the courtroom and said [...] "I love you" [...] to the defence team.|$|R
2500|$|The trial {{ended on}} June 28, 1865. Surratt was so ill {{the last four}} days of the trial that she was {{permitted}} to stay in her cell. Both legal teams appeared to have flaws in their cases, and except for Reverdy Johnson, neither team employed highly-skilled attorneys. The government's case was hindered by its failure <b>to</b> <b>call</b> as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> the man who shared Lloyd's carriage when he talked with Surratt and could have verified Lloyd's version of the [...] "shooting irons" [...] story or Metropolitan Police Chief A.C. Richards whose investigation had had the most success {{in the early days}} of the investigation. The government did not fully investigate Booth's meetings with Surratt at noon or the evening of the murder, and its questioning and cross-examination of witnesses was poorly prepared and weak. What is most important is that the government had botched the attempt to apprehend John, Jr. The defense's case, too, had a problem. The defense never followed up on inconsistencies in Weichmann's chronology of Mary's last visit to the tavern, which could have undermined Weichmann's entire credibility.|$|R
5000|$|When Gotti {{was indicted}} in 1990 for the 1985 murder of Paul Castellano {{and several other}} crimes, {{presiding}} judge I. Leo Glasser disqualified Cutler and two associates from representing Gotti. Citing evidence from wiretaps at Gotti's Ravenite club, prosecutors contended that Cutler and his colleagues may have known about criminal activity. Since the attorney-client privilege doesn't apply in these circumstances, prosecutors argued that Cutler was [...] "part of the evidence" [...] and thus liable <b>to</b> be <b>called</b> as <b>a</b> <b>witness.</b> They also argued that Cutler had represented other potential witnesses and thus had a conflict of interest. Glasser sided with the prosecutors, contending that Cutler was the [...] "in-house counsel" [...] for the Gambino family.|$|R
50|$|This {{process was}} time {{consuming}} and costly. The computer forensic expert’s primary {{role is to}} investigate the computer evidence (ESI). They {{may not have been}} as familiar with the entire case or objectives as that of the case agent, detective, forensic accountant or crime analyst. This often led to non-perfect or time consuming identification of the correct evidence items between the differing parties. What would immediately flag the interest of a detective with a deep knowledge of the case and parties involved may go unnoticed by a computer forensic expert. An example would be an email from a suspect in another case to a suspect in this case, or contact / phone <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> from <b>a</b> suspect.|$|R
