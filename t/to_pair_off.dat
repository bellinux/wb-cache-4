The use of modern technology has made it more practical for second language learners to actually practice speaking.

500|$|Taking {{work as an}} {{upholsterer}} {{to support}} his family, Cisneros's father began [...] "a compulsive circular migration between Chicago and Mexico City that became the dominating pattern of Cisneros's childhood." [...] Their family was constantly moving between the two countries, which necessitated their finding new places to live as well as schools for the children. Eventually the instability caused Cisneros's six brothers <b>to</b> <b>pair</b> <b>off</b> in twos, leaving her to define herself as the isolated one. Her feelings of exclusion from the family were exacerbated by her father, who referred to his [...] "seis hijos y una hija" [...] ("six sons and one daughter") rather than his [...] "siete hijos" [...] ("seven children"). Ganz notes that Cisneros's childhood loneliness was instrumental in shaping her later passion for writing. Cisneros‚Äôs one strong female influence was her mother, Elvira, who was a voracious reader and more enlightened and socially conscious than her father. According to Ganz, although Elvira was too dependent on her husband and too restricted in her opportunities to fulfill her own potential, she ensured her daughter would not suffer from the same disadvantages as she did.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Harrison of The New Republic {{believes}} that the writers deliberately broke up any main character who was approaching a borderline life-changing relationship because [...] "The ones the Friends were really meant to be with were, after all, the other Friends". Because Monica and Joey were initially conceived as the show's two most sexual characters, Crane and Kauffman had originally intended {{for them to be}} the show's main couple, before ultimately replacing them with Ross and Rachel. The idea of Monica and Joey was abandoned once the role of Joey was cast; actor Matt LeBlanc approached his character using much more of a [...] "big brother vibe" [...] in terms of Joey's relationship with Cox's character as opposed to a romantic one, which the writers ultimately preferred. According to Allison Piwowarski of Bustle, Monica and Joey's relationship would have greatly altered the trajectory of the entire series, having life-changing effects on its characters. Summarizing the role of Monica in the series, Martin Gitlin wrote in his book The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time that while her friends [...] "were ... just out {{to make the most of}} their social lives", Monica [...] "sought to keep the others in line" [...] while searching for [...] "Mr. Right", who surprisingly turns out to be close friend Chandler. Several years before Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, Cox once joked in an interview that if her character were to ever have sex with another main character, it would most likely be Chandler. Crane and Kauffman had never intended <b>to</b> <b>pair</b> <b>off</b> Monica and Chandler with each other, and only decided to expand upon the idea of a relationship between the two friends upon realizing that viewers had [...] "fallen in love" [...] with the notion of Monica and Chandler as a couple. According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, [...] "Their affair came out of the blue and was supposed to quickly return there ‚Äî but something in the relationship clicked with viewers." [...] The idea of Monica and Chandler's romantic arc originally surfaced much earlier in the series from writers Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan, who first observed the characters' chemistry in the season two episode [...] "The One Where Ross Finds Out", in which an idle and unemployed Monica is temporarily acting as Chandler's personal trainer. However, Silveri's suggestion was initially vetoed by the other writers, who felt that it was simply too soon to introduce another main couple to Friends having just recently paired off Ross and Rachel. Following Ross and Rachel's break up in season three, the writers felt that the timing was just about right to officially introduce Monica and Chandler as a couple, deciding that Friends [...] "can't simply rest on this one [...] relationship", while believing that Monica and Chandler's would ultimately provide a fun opportunity for the writers to explore brand new storylines.|$|E

5000|$|Pater's {{critical}} {{method was}} {{outlined in the}} 'Preface' to The Renaissance (1873) and refined in his later writings. In the 'Preface' he argues initially for a subjective, relativist response to life, ideas, art, {{as opposed to the}} drier, more objective, somewhat moralistic criticism practised by Matthew Arnold and others. [...] "The first step towards seeing one's object as it really is," [...] Pater wrote, [...] "is to know one's own impression, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly. What is this song or picture, this engaging personality in life or in a book, to me?" [...] When we have formed our impressions we proceed to find [...] "the power or forces" [...] which produced them, the work's [...] "virtue". [...] "Pater moves, in other words, from effects to causes, which are his real interest," [...] noted Richard Wollheim. Among these causes are, pre-eminently, original temperaments and types of mind; but Pater [...] "did not confine himself <b>to</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>off</b> a work of art with a particular temperament. Having a particular temperament under review, he would ask what was the range of forms in which it might find expression. Some of the forms will be metaphysical doctrines, ethical systems, literary theories, religions, myths. Pater's scepticism led him to think that in themselves all such systems lack sense or meaning - until meaning is conferred upon them by their capacity to give expression to a particular temperament." ...|$|R

This view would have appeared rank heresy to Colonel Feraud. Some melancholy forebodings of a military kind, expressed cautiously, would have been pronounced as nothing short of high treason by Colonel Feraud. But Leonie, the sister of Colonel D'Hubert, read them with profound satisfaction, and, folding the letter thoughtfully, remarked to herself that [...] "Armand was likely to prove eventually a sensible fellow."

Assuming it to be so, it is still to be proved that women are oftener misled by their personal feelings than men by their personal interests. The chief difference would seem in that case to be, that men are led from the course of duty and the public interest by their regard for themselves, women (not being allowed to have private interests of their own) by their regard for somebody else. It is also to be considered, that all the education which women receive from society inculcates on them {{the feeling that the}} individuals connected with them are the only ones to whom they owe any duty--the only ones whose interest they are called upon to care for; while, as far as education is concerned, they are left strangers even to the elementary ideas which are presupposed in any intelligent regard for larger interests or higher moral objects.

This {{could be due to}} the sample rate, the window size, and the overlap chosen (44100 ¬†Hz, 4096 and 50 %, respectively). Due to a large window size and high overlap for each consecutive sub-sample determined, as the time stretch distortion occurs (along the horizontal time axis), the combinatorial hashes or audio fingerprints generated would still match when compared [7]. In addition, this could be due to the number of audio fingerprints generated because of the ‚Äúneighbourhood‚Äù size in which the distance for peaks <b>to</b> be <b>paired</b> <b>off</b> is considered. In this case, this would cause a lot of audio fingerprints to be generated. As a result of the tempo change being constant for each test, the absolute offset difference between the query offset and the offset of the song in the database would be constant. Also, although the confidence may not be as high as the original sample without distortion, the accurate match would still have a generally high confidence.|$|R
