5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{larger in}} its {{northern}} range and in open habitats. A morphological size comparison {{study in the}} eastern United States found a divergence in {{the location of the}} largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing selection constraints for the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. <b>The</b> <b>CAT</b> <b>is</b> strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E

50|$|After this impairment, half of <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> {{placed in}} a quiet room, {{and the others were}} {{placed in a}} room with enriched {{acoustic}} environment. In enriched acoustic environment, <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> stimulated with high-frequency multitone complex stimulus. They were exposed to this environment 24 hours/day for 35 days, and results were compared.|$|R
50|$|The salon also {{provided}} a steady home for a great clowder of Angora <b>cats.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> a well-known feature of Madame Helvetius' salon, always bedecked with silk ribbons and doted on by their loving caregiver. Eighteen in all, <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> kept company by the Madame's dogs, canaries, and many other pets.|$|R
5|$|The jaguar is a near-threatened {{species and}} its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and {{fragmentation}} of habitat. While {{international trade in}} jaguars or their parts is prohibited, <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> still frequently killed by humans, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous American cultures, {{including those of the}} Maya and Aztec.|$|E
5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the jet streams. <b>The</b> <b>CAT</b> <b>is</b> strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.|$|E
5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both snow depth {{and the presence}} of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E

5|$|Jaguar females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age, and males at three or four. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> believed to mate throughout {{the year in the}} wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful. Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity. Female estrus is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization. Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship.|$|E
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E

In 1992 (Heisei 4), in the Yomiuri newspaper, there was an article that argued that when people thought they had heard a cat speak, upon listening a second time, they realized that it was simply the cat's meowing and that it was only coincidence that it resembled a word in human language.|$|E
