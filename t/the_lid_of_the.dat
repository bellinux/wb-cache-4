5|$|According to the Ananda Ramayana, king Padmaksha had a {{daughter}} named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka sealed in a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom.

40|$|Before <b>the</b> {{maturation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chromophore, {{a fluorescent}} protein, {{just like any}} other three-dimensional protein structure, has to fold into the correct tertiary structure to function.

Interference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hinge sites may lead to allosteric effects and disruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein’s functional motions. In the study, significant sequential and spatial conservation was found in conserved lid residues across 28 wild-type fluorescent proteins.

25|$|Unlike {{most members}} of the Mucorales, Apophysomyces species often fail to sporulate under {{standard}} clinical laboratory culture conditions.

25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E
30|$|Using {{aluminium}} foil {{as a witness}} coupon material, by exposing it to CC 2 for different durations, the amino acid content in CC 2 was quantitatively evaluated. To compare our results with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Johnson Space Center (NASA/JSC) OSIRIS-REx team, we used the same workflow system, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Aluminium foil, with a thickness of 0.05  mm, was cut to 3 [*]×[*] 3  cm pieces and baked at 450  °C for 6  h. The baked {{aluminium foil}} was placed in cleaned Pyrex Petri dishes (φ 28  mm) and introduced into CC 2 (Fig.  1 b). <b>The</b> cleaning procedure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Petri dishes {{was based on the}} procedure described by Ishibashi et al. (2012). They were then baked {{in the same way as}} the aluminium foil. <b>The</b> baking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aluminium foil and cleaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Petri dishes were done in the manufacturing and cleaning room at the ESCuC. After enclosing <b>the</b> pieces <b>of</b> aluminium foil in Petri dishes, they were brought to CC 2 in the planetary sample handling room at the ESCuC. After being evacuated and purged with nitrogen in <b>the</b> airlock <b>of</b> CC 2, <b>the</b> Petri dishes filled with aluminium foil were introduced into CC 2. After their introduction into CC 2, <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Petri dishes were opened, and the aluminium foil was exposed to the environment in CC 2. Five witness coupons were prepared and exposed for 1  day, 2  days, 8  days and 31  days, with the last used as a reference without exposure as a blank witness coupon. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupons was folded using tweezers inside CC 2 and taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber after closing <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Petri dishes. The blank witness coupon was directly stored in the Petri dish after being baked together with the other witness coupons. The Petri dishes were wrapped in triplicate with baked aluminium foil and transported to the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) for analysis.|$|R
30|$|Basidiospores secrete {{hygroscopic}} hexoses and alcohols (mannitol) localized {{at their}} hilar appendices for <b>the</b> assembly <b>of</b> Buller’s drops and at their adaxial shallow dents as hygroscopic compounds for <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> liquid films, {{both of which}} are required for rapid spore catapulting upon their fusion (Goates and Hoffmann 1986; Webster et al. 1989, 1995; Turner and Webster 1995). These organic metabolites together with inorganic ions like phosphate, sodium and potassium are transferred with the liquids spread over the propelled-off spores onto <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Petri-dishes where they might act further hygroscopically to attract more water to the spores (Elbert et al. 2007; Hassett et al. 2015).

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] as {{a tribute}} to Clapton's {{chocolate}} addiction. He derived the title and much of the lyrics from a box of Mackintosh's Good News chocolates, which Clapton began eating during one of his visits to Harrison's home.

For the lyrics to the second of the song's middle eight sections, Harrison received assistance from Derek Taylor, the press officer for the Beatles' new record label, Apple Records.

The outer surface (exoperidium) ranges in color from slightly brownish to grayish buff to deep brown; the exoperidium has a shaggy or hairy texture (a tomentum), with the hairs mostly pointing downward. The inner surface of the peridium (the endoperidium) is striated or grooved, and shiny. Young specimens have a lid, technically called an epiphragm, a thin membrane that covers the cup opening. The epiphragm is hairy {{like the rest of}} the exoperidial surface, but the hairs often wear off leaving behind a thin white layer stretched across <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cup. As the peridium matures and expands, this membrane breaks and falls off, exposing the peridioles within. The peridium is attached to its growing surface by a mass of closely packed hyphae called an emplacement; in C.striatus the maximum diameter of the emplacement is typically 8–12mm, and often incorporating small fragments of the growing surface into its structure.|$|E

500|$|Lacking a {{publisher}} for Diamond Trust of London, Rohrer moved onto other {{projects such as}} Inside a Star-Filled Sky and Sleep is Death. He also took on work at Gun, a video games consultancy firm, and there he made contact with Mark Seremet, CEO of Zoo Publishing.
