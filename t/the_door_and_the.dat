Kenneth asks Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{to feed his}} bird, as he is busy with two jobs now. Kenneth asks Tracy not to enter his bedroom, a request that makes Tracy curious. Believing Kenneth might be a serial killer, he tells Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and they decide to investigate Kenneth's bedroom. At Kenneth's apartment, they discover a bug bomb in his room, and reaching the conclusion that Kenneth is trying to poison them and they run out of his apartment. They forget to close <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bug bomb ends up killing the bird. When they tell Kenneth about his bird, he is more upset {{by the fact that}} Tracy and Jenna did not trust him, than the death of his bird. Tracy and Jenna, feeling horrible about what they have done, arrange a surprise for Kenneth at his apartment. When Kenneth goes home, he finds an entire collection of birds.|$|E

25|$|Regeneration is a {{historical}} and anti-war novel by Pat Barker, first published in 1991. The novel was a Booker Prize nominee and was described by the New York Times Book Review {{as one of the}} four best novels of the year in its year of publication. It is the first of three novels in the Regeneration Trilogy of novels on the First World War, the other two being The Eye in <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Ghost Road, which won the Booker Prize in 1995. The novel was adapted into a film by the same name in 1997 by Scottish film director Gillies MacKinnon and starring Jonathan Pryce as Rivers, James Wilby as Sassoon and Jonny Lee Miller as Prior. The film was successful in the UK and Canada, receiving nominations for a number of awards.|$|E

This has a heavy plank and muntin screen with narrow door and roof of heavy joists supporting the upper floor. The screen is 15th-century oak with a moulded and embattled head and rail. The door is narrow, massive and nail studded. The use of this chamber is unknown, {{it may have been the}} sacristy and muniment room or a priests' room to accommodate the monk when the Church was served by Prittlewell Priory.

25|$|Shia historians {{hold that}} Umar called for Ali and his {{followers}} {{to come out and}} swear allegiance to Abu Bakr. When they did not, Umar broke in, resulting in Fatimah's ribs being broken by being pressed between <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wall causing her to miscarry Muhsin which led to her eventual death. Another Shia version of the events says that Umar sent a force led by his slave-boy Qunfud to Fatimah's house instructing them to bring Ali to the mosque. Arriving at the house, Qunfud requested permission to enter, which was refused by Ali causing Qunfud to return to Abu Bakr and Umar and relate the events, who instructed them to go back and enter the house by force if necessary. Qunfud and his men returned but were this time refused permission by Fatimah which caused Qunfud to send his men back to Abu Bakr and Umar for further instructions who told them to burn the house down if necessary in order to bring Ali to them.|$|E
25|$|Hogg {{ended up}} with 7/33, all that was {{required}} was to bat out {{the remainder of the}} day to claim victory. But as only Warrandyte can, a shaky batting display opened <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> team were precariously at 7/77. A solid partnership recovered the damage to get to 7/113 with just 22 overs left in the match, but again the game changed, as the final 3 wickets fell in 3 overs. So Ainslie required 117 runs from 19 overs to reverse the result, and raced to 0/24 after the first 2. Then another twist, 2 quick wickets to Hogg and then a run out made it 3/34. The score reached 3/49 with 11 overs to play, when Hogg struck a batsman on the head with a bouncer, and an ambulance was required on the ground. Light was fading during the delay, and the umpires decided play couldn't recommence, so once again Warrandyte assumed the victory. But then more controversy, as RDCA officials announced play would continue on an unprecedented 4th day. So the players returned to the East Ringwood oval, and with a huge crowd in attendance, fortunes ebbed and flowed again until 7 runs were required from the final over with 5 wickets in hand. A bye from a disputed run out, a boundary, and finally a leg bye saw Ainslie Park reach the total, winning outright with 3 balls remaining of the 240th and last over. Warrandyte left to ponder how the lost a game they had already won.|$|E

500|$|The road's {{southern}} terminus at Woodbury Commons is {{the most}} frequent topic of discussion, especially since Black Friday in 2001, when heavy traffic from holiday shoppers along adjacent sections of not only 32 but routes 6 and 17 and the Thruway came to a complete standstill. [...] "This should have been planned for and it wasn't", complained one local official. [...] "Now you're trying to close <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> horse is already out". Despite several efforts {{and the presence of}} state police on later Black Fridays, a similar traffic jam occurred on Labor Day weekend 2006, when a break in bad weather led to an increase in shoppers so marked that US6 and the Thruway were backed up as far as Newburgh and the Palisades Interstate Parkway, respectively. The Woodbury police chief cited the blockage created by drivers making the left turn from Route32 to the Thruway as the cause. Plans to build an exit ramp that would allow that traffic to go directly to the tollbooth have been expedited.|$|E

The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a green screen. On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself. Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it [...] "prolific". On the second day, scenes {{at a high school}} were filmed; artificial rain was made. Afterward, White and a team of visual effect artists created the setting. [...] "If you watch just the offline edit of this video, it's just green. It's just Taylor walking around a giant green screen. And to think that every single thing in that video was created is amazing, 'cause a lot of people worked really hard on it", White said. The visual effects team were at work for the video for some time, sometimes staying overnight in the office to produce the video. The direction was to make the video seem [...] "magical". Some of the props used when filming were recreated using digital animation, such as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> desks. Because extras were filmed separately, White was meticulous to find the right shots to make the scene more cohesive. White believed the finished product had a sense of innocence.|$|E
