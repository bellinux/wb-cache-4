500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and we drove around this corner of these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E

500|$|Hooper {{made his}} debut as {{a feature film}} {{director}} with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission drama Red Dust (2004), which stars Hilary Swank, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jamie Bartlett. The film was not widely seen, which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the Iraq War: [...] "When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of 'we'd never do it in our own country…they're the horrible people but it's not us.' By the time the film came out (<b>there</b> <b>were)</b> <b>these</b> revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing. The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences {{it was designed to}} target. I have learned that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led." [...] The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on BBC Two in 2005, making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Up to {{the point}} the episode [...] "August" [...] aired, only one {{character}} {{that was part of}} a group known as [...] "Observers" [...] had been introduced. In this episode, two more such individuals were revealed: August (played by Peter Woodward) and December (played by Eugene Lipinski). The creation of Observers {{was one of the first}} ideas the writers of Fringe thought of when developing the show in its early stages, when they asked each other, [...] "What if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> characters where all they did was watch?". Pinkner and Wyman thought of creating Observers by [...] "looking for something... iconic" [...] that had the [...] "quality of being invisible". Though the Observer called September has appeared in every single Fringe episode in a brief cameo, he was first featured prominently in the fourth episode of the first season. The producers thought of unique characteristics for [...] "somebody who wasn't of our world," [...] evolving to the Observers having bald heads, no eyebrows, and [...] "largely deadened" [...] senses, which led to a love for extremely hot peppers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for Tron occurred in 1976 when Steven Lisberger, then an animator of drawings {{with his own}} studio, looked at a sample reel from a computer firm called MAGI and saw Pong for the first time. He was immediately fascinated by video games and {{wanted to do a}} film incorporating them. According to Lisberger, [...] "I realized that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> techniques that would be very suitable for bringing video games and computer visuals to the screen.

2500|$|Some {{people were}} sceptical about mass citizen {{training}} in CPR; indeed, many felt {{the potential for}} harm was too great to allow such a procedure {{in the hands of}} laypersons. The skeptics also had the support of national medical organizations. The alarmist voices were stilled by some fortunate saves. Cobb recalled one resuscitation soon after the citizen training program began. [...] "In March 1973 <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> kids playing golf at Jackson Park. They came across a victim {{a quarter of a mile}} from the clubhouse." [...] The man was unconscious and not breathing; later it was confirmed that he was in ventricular fibrillation.
