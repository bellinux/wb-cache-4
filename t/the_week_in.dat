5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.|$|E

5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople {{engaging}} in the battle, many decided to flee through the Battant.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Fingleton divided {{his time}} between Canberra, where until his {{retirement}} in 1978 he was political correspondent for Radio Australia, and cricket journalism. He forged close relationships with several Prime Ministers. In particular, Sir Robert Menzies, Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, provided him with a laudatory foreword in his book, Masters of Cricket. Fingleton's Test coverage resulted in a number of books that placed him at the forefront of Australian cricket writers. The books included Cricket Crisis (mainly an account of the 1932–33 Bodyline series), Brightly Fades the Don (the 1948 Invincibles tour), Brown & Company: The Tour in Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1950–51), The Ashes Crown the Year (the Australian tour of England in 1953), Masters of Cricket, Four Chukkas to Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1958–59), The Greatest Test of All (the Tied Test of 1960), Fingleton on Cricket and The Immortal Victor Trumper. His final book, the autobiographical Batting From Memory, was to have its Australian launch during <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> which he died of a heart attack. His cricket writing, {{regarded as one of the}} most stylish by an Australian, often left a sour taste with observers because of the persistent anti-Bradman jibes.|$|E
5|$|As {{professional}} football {{became a national}} television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, {{but by and large}} the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of <b>the</b> <b>Week</b> <b>in</b> 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.|$|E
