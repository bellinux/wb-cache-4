25|$|Many college {{entrance}} exams {{in the early}} 1900s were specific to each school and required candidates to travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> College Board, a consortium of colleges in the northeastern United States, was formed in 1900 to establish a nationally administered, uniform set of essay <b>tests</b> based on <b>the</b> curricula of the boarding schools that typically provided graduates to the colleges of the Ivy League and Seven Sisters, among others.|$|R

25|$|In {{a comment}} the {{following}} year on the same thread, Shelby questioned how {{it was that the}} dive shop employees failed to notice his son's truck in the parking lot throughout the day after he was last seen even though it was within their view the whole time. He is further critical of how the Holmes County sheriff's office handled the investigation, saying they should have treated it as a crime scene from the beginning. In particular, he claims, the lie detector test that Taran passed was inadequate, as it had consisted of only three questions (he says he later learned that a properly administered examination with the device should take over an hour), and that Kelly and Cronin should have been asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{head coach}} Herb Brooks had tryouts in Colorado Springs {{in the summer}} of 1979. Of the 20 players who {{eventually}} made the final Olympic roster, Buzz Schneider was the only one returning from the 1976 Olympic team. Nine players had played under Brooks at the University of Minnesota, which included Rob McClanahan, Mike Ramsey, and Phil Verchota; while four more were from Boston University: Dave Silk, Jack O'Callahan, goalie Jim Craig, and team captain Mike Eruzione. Boston University and Minnesota were perennial rivals in college hockey and the hostility carried over from some of the players on the Olympic team for the first few months. But part of Brooks' selection process was a 300-question psychological test that would give him insight on how every player would react under stress. Anyone who refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> would be flunked. Brooks had to select from 68 players who started the tryout.|$|E
25|$|In April 1997, he {{committed}} {{to play at}} UCLA, where {{he was expected to}} team with fellow incoming freshman Baron Davis, another top recruit from Los Angeles, who signed days later. Cotton's admission was contingent on earning a qualifying score on the SAT, which he had not received in two attempts. On his third try, he scored 900, which surpassed the NCAA minimum of 700 for incoming freshman, but the NCAA invalidated his score. Cotton had been diagnosed with a learning disability, auditory learning, in which he comprehended better by listening than by seeing. The Educational Testing Service (ETS), which publishes and oversees the SAT, confirmed the diagnosis, and allowed him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> with extra time and larger font text. The NCAA, however, had stricter criteria than the ETS, and disagreed that he was entitled to take the non-standard test. Cotton denied any wrongdoing, and felt he was being targeted by the NCAA. Earlier, the NCAA had investigated a Ford sport-utility vehicle driven by Cotton, which they suspected was provided to him as an incentive to sign with UCLA. However, the NCAA absolved him of violating his amateur status based on documents provided by his parents.|$|E

25|$|One {{apparatus}} of government which fell into Wu's power was the imperial examination system: the basic {{theory and practice}} of which was to recruit into government service those men who were the best educated, talented, and having the best potential to perform their duties, and to do so by testing a pool of candidates in order to determine this objectively. This pool was male only, and the qualified pool of candidates and resulting placements into official positions was on a relatively small scale at the time of Wu's assuming control of government. The official tests examined such things considered important for functionaries of the highly developed, bureaucratic government structure of the current imperial government. The qualities sought in a candidate for government service included determining the potential official's level of literacy in terms of reading and writing as well as his possession of the specific knowledge considered necessary and desirable for a governmental official, such as Confucian precepts on the nature of virtue and theory on the proper ordering of and relationships within society. Wu Zetian continued to use the imperial examination system to recruit civil servants, and she introduced major changes in regard to the system that she inherited, including increasing the pool of candidates permitted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> by allowing commoners and gentry, who were previously disqualified by their background, to take them. Another thing she did was to expand the governmental examination system and to greatly increase the importance of this method of recruiting government officials, which she did in 693. Wu provided increased opportunity for the representation within government to people of the North China Plain, versus people of the northwestern aristocratic families, (whom she decimated, anyway); and, the successful candidates who were recruited through the examination system became an elite group within her government. The historical details surrounding and the consequences of Wu Zetian's promoting a new group of people from previously disenfranchised backgrounds into prominence as powerful governmental officials as well as the role of the examination system in this regard, remains a matter of debate for scholars of this subject.|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, {{this paper}} was written without any {{intention}} to propose that only reading should be assessed for university entrance examinations in Japan. Such a practice will naturally lead English classes to heavily focus on reading only, possibly via the Grammar Translation Method. In order to foster communicative skills in a balanced manner among students, including productive skills, tasks in which students utilize all four skills should be implemented. For that sake, the washback effect imposed by such a high-stake test as NCT is useful, if not indispensable. It is sincerely hoped that, through implementing the system to require all students <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> of four skills for university entrance examination, English education in Japan will cultivate all four skills among students more than ever.|$|R

25|$|After Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party {{seized power}} in January 1933, and with {{antisemitism}} on the rise, the school became increasingly Jewish, as some parents bowed to pressure to boycott Jewish institutions and Jewish parents found {{it increasingly difficult}} to find placement for their children. In April 1933, when all public buildings were ordered to fly the Nazi flag and swastika, Essinger planned a day-long outing for her school, leaving the flag to fly over an empty building, a symbolic gesture, according to a nephew. Afterwards, Essinger and the school were denounced and the school came under Nazi scrutiny with a recommendation to install a school inspector at the school. In May 1933, Essinger was informed that her oldest pupils would not be allowed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> for <b>the</b> abitur, the school-leaving certificate needed to pursue a university education, and most non-Jewish parents withdrew their children from the school.|$|R

50|$|Admission to NODET {{schools is}} {{selective}} {{and based on}} a comprehensive nationwide entrance examination procedure. Every year thousands of students apply to enter the schools, from which less than 1% are chosen for the 99 middle schools and 98 high-schools within the country. Each student has chance of admission to the school only two times during his/her studies. The first chance is when he/she is at grade 6 elementary school and the second chance is when he/she is at grade 9. If the student is accepted when he/she was at grade 5 then he/she will be re-evaluated at grade 9, with others that were not successful in their first try, to ensure he/she is still qualified to pursue his/her studies further at NODET. Each entrance exam includes two tests devised to measure intelligence and talent of the participants rather than their acquired knowledge. Once students are considered competitive, they are allowed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> first <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> result of which determines if they are allowed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> second <b>test.</b> <b>The</b> source of questions is not pre-announced.|$|R
