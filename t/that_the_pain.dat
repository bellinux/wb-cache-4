25|$|Acute {{sinusitis}} may {{be accompanied}} by thick nasal discharge that is usually green in color and may contain pus (purulent) and/or blood. Often a localized headache or toothache is present, and it is these symptoms that distinguish a sinus-related headache from other types of headaches, such as tension and migraine headaches. Another way to distinguish between toothache and sinusitis is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> in sinusitis is usually worsened by tilting the head forwards and with valsalva maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{clinical}} decision-making, a simple, minimally invasive, in-office procedure may be performed, the rotator cuff impingement test. A {{small amount of}} a local anesthetic and an injectable corticosteroid are injected into the subacromial space to block pain and to provide anti-inflammatory relief. If pain disappears and shoulder function remains good, no further testing is pursued. The test helps to confirm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> arises from the shoulder primarily rather than referred from the neck, heart, or gut.|$|E
25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, it {{was found}} that the {{patients}} often developed pain and hypersensitivity to stimuli during recovery of function. And thus it was thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> associated after stroke was part of the stroke and lesion repair process occurring in the brain. It is now accepted that Dejerine–Roussy syndrome is a condition developed due to lesions interfering with the sensory process, which triggered the start of pharmaceutical and stimulation treatment research. The last 50 years have been filled with refractory treatment research. As of the early 2000s, longer treatments lasting months to years have been explored in the continued search for permanent removal of abnormal pain.|$|E
25|$|Although Smith-Dorrien was {{perfectly}} urbane and, {{by the standards}} of the day, kind-hearted towards his troops, he was notorious for furious outbursts of bad temper, which could last for hours before his equilibrium was restored. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> from a knee injury was one cause of his ill temper. It was rumoured that Smith-Dorrien’s temper was caused by some kind of serious illness. Esher (a royal courtier who exercised great influence over military appointments) had dined with Smith-Dorrien (28 January 1908) to see if he was indeed “changed and weakened”. Lord Crewe (letter to Seely 5 September 1913) turned him down for the post of Commander-in-Chief India because of his foul temper (A.J. Smithers, probably wrongly, blames French’s enmity for denying Smith-Dorrien the promotion).|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{have made}} it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly. The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals have no language. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that {{there is no reason to}} suppose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.|$|E

2500|$|First, it is {{not clear}} where the {{interaction}} would take place. For example, burning one's finger causes pain. Apparently there is some chain of events, leading from the burning of skin, to the stimulation of nerve endings, to something happening in the peripheral nerves of one's body that lead to one's brain, to something happening in a particular part of one's brain, and finally resulting in the sensation of pain. But pain is not supposed to be spatially locatable. It might be responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> [...] "takes place in the brain." [...] But evidently, the pain is in the finger.

2500|$|Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is neuropathic pain {{which is}} caused by damage to the neurons in the brain (central nervous system), {{as the result of}} a {{vascular}} injury. One study found that up to 8% of people who have had a stroke will develop central post-stroke pain, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> will be moderate to severe in 5% of those affected. [...] The condition was formerly called [...] "thalamic pain", because of the high incidence among those with damage to the thalamus or thalamic nuclei. Now known as CPSP, it is characterized by perceived pain from non-painful stimuli, such as temperature and light touch. This altered perception of stimuli, or allodynia, can be difficult to assess due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> can change daily in description and location, and can appear anywhere from months to years after the stroke. CPSP can also lead to a heightened central response to painful sensations, or hyperpathia. Affected persons may describe the pain as cramping, burning, crushing, shooting, pins and needles, and even bloating or urinary urgency. [...] Both the variation and mechanism of pain in CPSP have made it difficult to treat. Several strategies have been employed by physicians, including intravenous lidocaine, opioids/narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-epileptic medications and neurosurgical procedures with varying success. Higher rates of successful pain control in persons with CPSP can be achieved by treating other sequelae of stroke, such as depression and spasticity. As the age of the population increases, the diagnosis and management of CPSP will become increasingly important to improve the quality of life of an increasing number of stroke survivors.|$|E

2500|$|His {{close friend}} Padre Agostino wrote {{to him in}} 1915, asking {{specific}} questions, such as when he first experienced visions, whether he had been granted the stigmata, and whether he felt the pains of the Passion of Christ, namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Padre Pio replied {{that he had been}} favoured with visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904). He wrote that although he had been granted the stigmata, he had been so terrified by the phenomenon he begged the Lord to withdraw them. He wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since at the time he purportedly considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation. [...] The visible wounds disappeared at that point, but reappeared in September 1918. He reported, however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. He also said that he was suffering the pain of the crown of thorns and the scourging. He did not define the frequency of these occurrences but said that he had been suffering from them at least once weekly for some years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} {{fibromyalgia}} is unknown. However, several hypotheses {{have been developed}} including [...] "central sensitization". This theory proposes that people with fibromyalgia have a lower threshold for pain because of increased reactivity of pain-sensitive nerve cells in the spinal cord or brain. Neuropathic pain and major depressive disorder often co-occur with fibromyalgia – {{the reason for this}} comorbidity appears to be due to shared genetic abnormalities, which leads to impairments in monoaminergic, glutamatergic, neurotrophic, opioid and proinflammatory cytokine signaling. In these vulnerable individuals, psychological stress or illness can cause abnormalities in inflammatory and stress pathways which regulate mood and pain. Eventually, a sensitization and kindling effect occur in certain neurons leading to the establishment of fibromyalgia and sometimes a mood disorder. The evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> in fibromyalgia results primarily from pain processing pathways functioning abnormally. In simple terms, it can be described as the volume of the neurons being set too high and this hyper-excitability of pain processing pathways and under-activity of inhibitory pain pathways in the brain results in the affected individual experiencing pain. Some neurochemical abnormalities that occur in fibromyalgia also regulate mood, sleep, and energy, thus explaining why mood, sleep, and fatigue problems are commonly co-morbid with fibromyalgia.|$|E
