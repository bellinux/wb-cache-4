40|$|In the {{semiconductor}} back-end manufacturing, the device test {{central processing unit}} (CPU) is most costly and is typically the bottleneck machine at the test plant. A multihead tester contains a CPU and several <b>test</b> <b>heads,</b> each {{of which can be}} connected to a handler that processes one lot of the same device. The residence time of a lot is closely related to the product mix on <b>test</b> <b>heads,</b> which increases the complexity of this problem. It is critical for the test scheduling problem to reduce CPU's idle time and to increase tester utilization. In this paper, a multihead tester scheduling problem is formulated as an identical parallel machine scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing makespan. A heuristic grouping method is developed to obtain a good initial solution in a short time. Three metaheuristic techniques, using lot-specific and configuration-specific information, are proposed to receive a near-optimum and are compared to traditional approaches. Computational experiments show that a tabu search with lot-specific information outperforms all other competing approaches...|$|R

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{diagnosed}} in American males. However, current methods of screening for prostate cancer have low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing patients with prostate cancer. A new methodology of screening for prostate cancer was formulated by developing a method and device to quantify the traditional digital rectal exam. The Quantitative Digital Rectal Exam (QDRE) measures the relative compliance at discrete locations on the posterior surface of the prostate. The <b>Test</b> <b>Head</b> of the QDRE indents the prostate and measures the pressure distribution across a rigid disk using an matrix of pressure transducers. The position of the <b>Test</b> <b>Head</b> is tracked by the Location Tracking System. The Mapping Algorithm analyzes each <b>Test</b> <b>Head</b> measurement and the position information recorded by the Location Tracking System, and generates a map showing magnitudes and locations of relative compliance across the measured surface of the prostate. A proof of concept test used a mock-up of the <b>Test</b> <b>Head,</b> a mechanical Location Tracking System and a rudimentary Mapping Algorithm to examine a clinical model of the prostate which had one nodule. The results were presented as a map of the measured surface of the prostate model, and results showed the size of the nodule (6. 4 mm in diameter) and the relative compliance of the nodule (0. 08 relative to the healthy tissue of the model), as well as the location within the measured surface. by Stacy J.
