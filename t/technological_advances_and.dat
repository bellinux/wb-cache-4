25|$|Historians {{have also}} noted {{population}} densities seem {{to concentrate on}} coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source. Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, <b>technological</b> <b>advances,</b> <b>and</b> people. They also {{have to rely on}} costly and time consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.|$|E

500|$|While Bushnell’s {{name is not}} {{generally}} well-known, he is often credited with revolutionizing naval warfare from below. Bushnell’s Turtle created a military vantage point unseen prior to the Revolutionary War—a view from under the war-stricken waters. As historian Alex Roland argues, Bushnell’s legacy as an inventor was also burnished by American writers and historians who in the early nineteenth-century lionized Bushnell and his submarine. To a new postwar generation of Americans, he seemed “the ingenious patriot who invented the submarine that terrified the British.” [...] Bushnell {{joined the ranks of}} American inventors of the era such as Eli Whitney and Robert Fulton. [...] These men served as national heroes to Americans who advocated for <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> <b>and</b> idolized the men making them. “Whether the motives were military pride or scientific nationalism,” Roland contends, “it was important to Americans in the first half century after the Revolution to look upon Bushnell’s submarine as an American original.|$|E
500|$|Chinese {{cities of}} the Song period became {{some of the largest}} in the world, owing to <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> <b>and</b> an {{agricultural}} revolution. Kaifeng, which served as the capital and seat of government during the Northern Song (960–1127), had some half a million residents in 1021, with another half-million living in the city's nine designated suburbs. By 1100, the civilian population within the city walls was 1,050,000; the army stationed there brought the total to 1.4 million. Hangzhou, the capital during the Southern Song (1127–1279), had more than 400,000 inhabitants during the late 12th century, primarily due to its trading position at the southern terminus of the Grand Canal, known as the lower Yangzi's [...] "grain basket." [...] During the 13th century, the city's population soared to approximately a million people, with the 1270 census counting 186,330 registered families living in the city. Although not as agriculturally rich as areas like western Sichuan, the region of Fujian also underwent a massive population growth; government records indicate a 1500% {{increase in the number of}} registered households from the years 742 to 1208. [...] With a thriving shipbuilding industry and new mining facilities, Fujian became the economic powerhouse of China during the Song period. The great seaport of China, Quanzhou, was located in Fujian, and by 1120 its governor claimed that the city's population had reached some 500,000. The inland Fujianese city of Jiankang was also very large at this time, with a population of about 200,000. Robert Hartwell states that from 742 to 1200 the population growth of North China increased by only 54% percent in comparison to the Southeast which grew by 695%, the middle Yangzi Valley by 483%, the Lingnan region by 150%, and the upper Yangzi Valley by 135%. From the 8th to 11th centuries the lower Yangzi Valley experienced modest population growth in comparison to other regions of South China. The shift of the capital to Hangzhou did not create an immediate dramatic change in population growth until the period from 1170 to 1225, when new polders allowed land reclamation for nearly all the arable land between Lake Tai and the East China Sea as well as the mouth of the Yangzi to the northern Zhejiang coast.|$|E

2500|$|After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Meiji {{government}} {{endeavored to}} assimilate Western ideas, <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> <b>and</b> ways of warfare. By the late 19th century, Japan had transformed {{itself into a}} modernized industrial state. The Japanese wanted {{to be recognized as}} equal with the Western powers. The Meiji restoration had always been intended to make Japan a modernized state, not a Westernized one, and Japan was always an imperialist power, looking towards overseas expansionism. In the years 1869–73, the Seikanron ("Conquer Korea Argument") had bitterly divided the Japanese elite between one faction that wanted to conquer Korea immediately vs. another that wanted to wait until Japan was more modernized before embarking on a war to conquer Korea; significantly no-one in the Japanese elite ever accepted the idea that the Koreans had the right to be independent, with only the question of timing dividing the two factions. In {{much the same way that}} Europeans used the backwardness of Africa and Asia as a reason for why they had to conquer nations of Africa and Asia, for the Japanese elite the backwardness of China and Korea was proof of the inferiority of those nations, thus giving the Japanese the [...] "right" [...] to conquer them. Inouye Kaoru, the Foreign Minister gave a speech in 1887 saying [...] "What we must do is to transform our empire and our people, make the empire like the countries of Europe and our people like the peoples of Europe", going to say that the Chinese and Koreans had essentially forfeited their right to be independent by not modernizing. Much of the pressure for an aggressive foreign policy in Japan came from below, with the advocates of [...] "people's rights" [...] movement calling for an elected parliament also favoring an ultra-nationalist line that took it for granted the Japanese had the [...] "right" [...] to annex Korea, as the [...] "people's right" [...] movement was led by those who favored invading Korea in the years 1869–73. As part of the modernization process in Japan, Social Darwinian ideas about the [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] were common in Japan from the 1880s onward and many ordinary Japanese resented the heavy taxes imposed by the government to modernize Japan, demanding something tangible like an overseas colony as a reward for their sacrifices. Furthermore, the educational system of Meiji Japan was meant to train the schoolboys to be soldiers when they grew up, and as such, Japanese schools indoctrinated their students into Bushido ("the spirit of the warriors"), the fierce code of the samurai. Having indoctrinated the younger generations into Bushido, the Meiji elite found themselves faced with a people who clamored for war, and regarded diplomacy as a weakness. The British Japanologist Richard Storry wrote the biggest misconception about Japan in the West was that the Japanese people were the [...] "docile" [...] instruments of the elite, when in fact much of the pressure for Japan's wars from 1894 to 1941 came from below, as ordinary people demanded a [...] "tough" [...] foreign policy, and tended to engage in riots and assassination when foreign policy was perceived to be pusillanimous. Though the Meiji oligarchy refused to allow democracy, they did seek to appropriate some of the demands of the [...] "people's rights" [...] movement by allowing an elected Diet in 1890 (with limited powers and an equally limited franchise) and by pursuing an aggressive foreign policy towards Korea.|$|E
