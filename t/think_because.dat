It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E
25|$|When I {{first started}} doing the stain paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I <b>think,</b> <b>because</b> the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} her success with Election, Witherspoon noted in an {{interview}} that she struggled to find work after completing the film, due to typecasting. [...] Analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>because</b> the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was who I was, rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice—studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about." [...] In 2000, Witherspoon played a supporting role in American Psycho and made a cameo appearance in Little Nicky. She also guest starred in season six of Friends as Rachel Green's sister Jill.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer and}} actor Mark Gatiss, paying tribute to Kneale on the BBC News Online website {{shortly after his}} death, {{indicated}} that {{he was among the}} first rank of British television writers, but that this had been overlooked. [...] "He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as Dennis Potter, as David Mercer, as Alan Bleasdale, as Alan Bennett, but I <b>think</b> <b>because</b> of a strange snobbery about fantasy or sci-fi it's never quite been that way." [...] Similarly, his obituary in The Guardian commented that: Kneale was {{by no means the only}} author to have been largely wasted by television, and to have seen his status overtaken by soap opera hacks. But his place is secure, alongside Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, John Wyndham and Brian Aldiss, as one of the best, most exciting and most compassionate English science fiction writers of his century.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{has said}} of his character: [...] "The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By everything. By every single thing. That's what's {{wonderful}} about him as a character. It's why children like him, I <b>think.</b> <b>Because</b> he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe." [...] In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with Orbital, and performed with them {{a version of the}} Doctor Who theme, at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 24–25 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the Olympic torch in Cardiff, an activity which was noted by Doctor Who fans for its resemblance to a 2006 episode of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} 2013 Christmas special.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Jared Leto told MTV News {{that he was}} {{preparing}} to shoot a short film for [...] "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what I do, so it was a really natural and comfortable thing. I <b>think</b> <b>because</b> I did all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E
500|$|Taare Zameen Par {{received}} several positive reviews. Subhash K.

Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone <b>think.</b> <b>Because</b> it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed." ...|$|E

500|$|Following his transfer, Garland {{opened his}} stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against Bucknell, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes {{off the bench}} and {{recording}} 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People <b>think</b> <b>because</b> he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running out, and I felt like I could get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E

2500|$|The Earth of {{the early}} Archean (...) {{may have had a}} {{different}} tectonic style. During this time, the Earth's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form.

This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events.|$|E

[...] Turing's new question is: [...] "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" [...] This question, Turing believed, is one that can actually be answered.
