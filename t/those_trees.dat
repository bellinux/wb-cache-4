The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square.

5|$|The alpine biome of {{the pass}} extends below it {{on either side}} to an {{elevation}} of approximately , or about the altitude of the Linkins Lake trailhead on the western side, Highway 82's uppermost crossing of the Roaring Fork. Below it is a subalpine zone where lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir and aspen dominate the forest. A few patches of <b>those</b> <b>trees</b> persist above that elevation, but they are mostly stunted krummholz.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever <b>those</b> <b>trees</b> grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E

The [...] "Herty system" [...] required less forestry expertise and labor, both necessities to insure the method's financial success in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{distributed}} query execution {{method for}} Resource Description Frame-work (RDF) storage managers is proposed. Method {{is intended for}} use with an RDF storage manager called big 3 store to enable it to perform efficient query ex-ecution over large-scale RDF data sets. The storage manager converts SPARQL queries into tree structures using RDF algebra formalism. The nodes of <b>those</b> <b>tree</b> structures are represented by independent processes that execute the query au-tonomously and in a highly parallel manner by sending asynchronous messages to each other. The proposed data and query distribution method decreases the amount of inter-server messages during query executions by use of the semantic properties of RDF data sets. ...|$|R
