The Dutch then seized Tucker and Surinam on 23 June, despite Tucker's best efforts to escape. The Dutch first released Surinams crew, and then Tucker and his officers, in hopes of an exchange of prisoners. Tucker himself spent some four months in close confinement in a dungeon. At his subsequent court-martial, Tucker was acquitted of all blame for the loss. However, the court-martial did reprimand Tucker for unofficerlike conduct in his dealings with the Dutch authorities.

500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Vig {{and the band}} set out to mix the album. However, after a few days, both Vig and the band members {{realized that they were}} unhappy with how the mixes were turning out. As a result, they decided to call in someone else to oversee the mixing, with Geffen Records imprint DGC supplying a list of possible options. The list contained several familiar names, including Scott Litt (known for his work with R.E.M.) and Ed Stasium (known for his work with The Ramones and The Smithereens). However, Cobain feared that bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands. Instead, Cobain chose Andy Wallace (who had co-produced Slayer's 1990 album Seasons in the Abyss) from <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> Novoselic recalled, [...] "We said, 'right on,' because those Slayer records were so heavy." [...] Wallace ran the songs through various special effects boxes and tweaked the drum sounds, completing about one mix per day. Both Wallace and Vig noted years later that upon hearing Wallace's work the band loved the mixes. After the album's release, however, members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind. Cobain said in Come as You Are, [...] "Looking back on the production of Nevermind, I'm embarrassed by it now. It's closer to a Mötley Crüe record than it is a punk rock record." ...|$|E
500|$|Toyota, {{discovering}} that the Australian public wanted {{something that was}} modern and designed with consideration to the Australian market, began full-scale planning work on its Avalon replacement in 2002. Toyota Australia realised that no other model being developed at the time for Japan or North America {{was going to be}} suitable, and due to the size limitations of the Australian market, a completely indigenous model was unrealisable. However, at that time, Toyota Australia did not have any designers of its own. As a result, the company recruited Paul Beranger in August 2002 to set up Toyota Style Australia (TSA) in an industrial complex located in Dingley Village, Victoria. TSA first developed the X-Runner and Sportivo Coupe concepts, and in 2003, Nick Hogios, who had previously worked for Ford Australia on designing the XR performance models of the BA Falcon, was appointed chief designer. TSA's next venture was more significant—a privately developed model based on the Camry XV30—a car that signalled the beginning of the Aurion programme. Codenamed [...] "380L" [...] and developed during the course of 2003, this one-off model was forged by stripping panels and interior components from the donor Camry, and substituting these for TSA-developed versions. Total cost was approximately million. Focus groups conducted by Toyota in early 2003 had ranked the Avalon at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> when compared to the competing Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon, and Mitsubishi Magna. Later on in the year, the same focus groups were called back and the Avalon was exchanged for the 380L. Overall, the groups ranked the Toyota as their first preference, and according to Beranger, [...] "didn't see the car as a Camry". As such, Toyota Australia deduced that if the 380L was available for purchase there and then, they could sell it alongside the regular Camry as a six-cylinder car under a different name.|$|E

Later Brickhill wrote a larger study and the first major account of the escape in The Great Escape (1950), bringing the incident to a wide public attention. This book became the basis of the film (1963).|$|E

My home now was upon an avenue leading into the plaza from the south, the main artery down which we had marched from the gates of the city.

The same grandeur of architecture which was so noticeable a characteristic of Korad was in evidence here, only, if that were possible, on a larger and richer scale. My quarters would have been suitable for housing the greatest of earthly emperors, but to these queer creatures nothing about a building appealed to them but its size and the enormity of its chambers; the larger the building, the more desirable; and so Tal Hajus occupied what must have been an enormous public building, the largest in the city, but entirely unfitted for residence purposes; the next largest was reserved for Lorquas Ptomel, the next for the jed of a lesser rank, and so on to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of five jeds.
