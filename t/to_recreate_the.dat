5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that artificial gene synthesis {{could be used}} <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> virus from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> virus. The first step to mitigating this risk, it has been suggested, should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of Diddy Kong Racing, another team {{was working on a}} new game known as Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo 64. However, Shigeru Miyamoto, a Nintendo executive, demanded the team <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> game as a Star Fox title for Nintendo's new console, the GameCube. Unlike previous Star Fox games, Star Fox Adventures focused on ground-based open world exploration. The game received positive reviews upon its launch in 2002.

5|$|An effort <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a {{collaboration}} among the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the USDA ARS Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.

5|$|GioGio's Bizarre Adventure was {{developed}} by Capcom. It is based on Vento Aureo, the fifth part of Hirohiko Araki's manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and features artwork by Araki. <b>To</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> art style of the manga, Capcom developed a technique called Artistoon, {{which is used to}} render cel-shaded graphics. Capcom published the game in Japan on July 25, 2002 for the PlayStation 2, with a budget-priced re-release following on September 20, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> atomic {{bombing of}} Nagasaki, RSP studied natural {{phenomena}} such as volcanoes, instead {{of relying on}} archived footage of atomic blasts, and recreated the effects digitally. They also replaced the Sydney cityscape on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12 foot tall animatronic bear, that was used for shots of the creature dying after it {{had been hit by}} poisoned arrows fired by hunters.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a bottle}} {{conditioned}} beer, FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high lactic acid content. Finally, the beer is allowed to mature in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq and Brungardt disregarded their {{previous}} experience in recording production while making The Way I See It.

5|$|The Alliance devises {{a plan to}} {{halt the}} Shivan {{invasion}} while evacuating civilians and others from the Capella star system, by collapsing the two jump nodes from Capella {{to the rest of}} GTVA space. The Alliance plans <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> same conditions that collapsed the Sol jump nodes—namely a sufficiently powerful meson explosion, using a number of Great War-era destroyers, including the Bastion, which the GTVA send out to collapse the Capella–Epsilon Pegasi node by detonating its payload while it is within the node.|$|E

5|$|The {{color of}} the shellac was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by {{exposure}} to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. <b>To</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reliable}} edition was Canu Aneirin by Ifor Williams {{with notes}} in Welsh, published in 1938. New translations {{based on this}} work were published by Kenneth H. Jackson in 1969 and, with modernized Welsh text and glossary, by A.O.H. Jarman in 1988. A colour facsimile edition of the manuscript with an introduction by Daniel Huws was published by South Glamorgan County Council and the National Library of Wales in 1989. John Koch's new edition, which aimed <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> original text, appeared in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} for the game's {{characters are}} cel-shaded, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle {{that the camera}} views them from, in order <b>to</b> <b>recreate</b> <b>the</b> 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show. The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment. The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware. There is a different cover for the game on each console.|$|E

5|$|The tarpan or European {{wild horse}} (Equus ferus ferus) {{was found in}} Europe and much of Asia.
