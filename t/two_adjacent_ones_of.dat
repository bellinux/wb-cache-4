40|$|The {{spectral}} {{properties of}} chromatic detection mechanisms were investigated using a noise-masking paradigm. Contrast detection thresholds were measured for a signal with a Gaussian spatial profile, modulated in the equiluminant {{plane in the}} presence of spatial, chromatic noise. The noise was distributed within a sector in the equiluminant plane, centered on the signal direction. Each stimulus consisted <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> fields, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which contained the signal, separated horizontally by a gap with the same average chromaticity as the uniform background. Observers were asked to judge on which side of the central fixation point the signal was displayed via a two-alternative, forced-choice (2 AFC) paradigm. Contrast thresholds were measured for four color directions and three sector-widths at increasing levels of the average energy of the axial component of the noise. Results show that contrast thresholds are unaffected by the width of the noise sector, as previously found for temporally modulated stimuli (D'Zmura & Knoblauch, Vision Res 38 : 3117 - 3128, 1998). The results are consistent with the existence of spectrally broadband linear detection mechanisms tuned to the signal color direction and support the hypothesis of the existence of higher-order color mechanisms with sensitivities tuned to intermediate directions in the color space...|$|R
40|$|Many {{problems}} in extremal graph theory correspond to questions involving homomorphisms into a fixed image graph. Recently, {{there has been}} interest in maximizing the number of homomorphisms from graphs with a fixed number of vertices and edges into small image graphs. For the image graph H_ind, the graph on <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> vertices, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which is looped, each homomorphism from G to H_ind corresponds to an independent set in G. It follows from the Kruskal-Katona theorem {{that the number of}} homomorphisms to H_ind is maximized by the lex graph, whose edges form an initial segment of the lex order. A loop-threshold graph is a graph built recursively from a single vertex, which may be looped or unlooped, by successively adding either a looped dominating vertex or an unlooped isolated vertex at each stage. Thus, the graph H_ind is a loop-threshold graph. We survey known results for maximizing the number of homomorphisms into small loop-threshold image graphs. The only extremal homomorphism problem with a loop-threshold image graph on at most three vertices not yet solved is H_ind∪ E_ 1, where extremal graphs are the union of a lex graph and an empty graph. The only question that remains is the size of the lex component of the extremal graph. While we cannot give an exact answer for every number of vertices and edges, we establish the significance of and give a bound for ℓ(m), the number of vertices in the lex component of the extremal graph with m edges and at least m+ 1 vertices...|$|R

We have sequenced the MOMP genes for a serovar A and a serovar B isolate and have compared these new sequences with those already reported. Intra-serovar {{changes in the}} inferred amino acid sequences of the surface-exposed variable segments known {{to be responsible for}} binding of neutralizing antibody were observed. Nevertheless, epitope mapping with solid-phase peptides showed that these intra-serovar changes did not affect the binding of serovar- and subspecies-specific, potentially protective antibodies. Variable segment 1 of C. trachomatis serovar A contained <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> antibody-binding sites, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which was C-subspecies specific while the other was serovar A specific. Therefore the subspecies binding site for C-complex organisms is in variable segment 1, whilst that for B-complex organisms is in variable segment 4. This work shows that MOMP sequences are relatively stable within the serovar categorization for isolates taken decades apart from different continents. Within a given serovar, however, limited interchange of functionally related amino acids may occur without impairing the binding of serovar-specific antibody...|$|R

In this study, water holding capacity of soil, moisture distribution within the root zone and crop yield of sorghum plant are considered as factors influencing the drip irrigation management. Four basic plant-dripper configurations (the first and the second are surface dripper lines on plant rows (SO) and between plant-rows (SB) respectively, the third is buried dripper lines between plant rows (BB) while the fourth is surface dripper lines on plant rows together with buried dripper lines between plant rows (SOBB)) are investigated. The study is performed under open air condition in <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> fields; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them has a new reclaimed sandy soil and the second has sandy soil incorporated with clay. The plants growing in both soils received same amount of fertilizers and same water volume during the growing stages. The {{results indicated that the}} crop yield of sorghum growing in sandy soil incorporated with clay is higher than that growing in sandy soil. Also, it is higher with the fourth dripper configuration (SOBB). The plant roots are grew and emanated profusely in the incorporated soil. The incorporated soil retains water higher than the sandy soil. Higher water contents are observed under (SOBB) dripper configuration for both soils. During flowering and pollination stages, a deficit in soil water contents associated with plant wither is observed. So, an increase in water application rate from the emitters is required in these stages comparing with the other plant growing stages. The (SOBB) configuration is strongly recommended while (BB) configuration is not recommended for irrigating crops having larger distance between plants...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that a number}} of surface characteristics affect the extent of adhesion between <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> materials. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> such parameters is the surface roughness as surface asperities at the nanoscale level govern the overall adhesive forces. For example, the extent of bacterial adhesion is determined by the surface topography; also, once a bacteria colonizes a surface, proliferation of that species will take place and a biofilm may form, increasing the resistance of bacterial cells to removal. In this study, borosilicate glass was employed with varying surface roughness and coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in order to replicate the protein layer that covers orthopedic devices on implantation. As roughness is a scale-dependent process, relevant scan areas were analyzed using atomic force microscope (AFM) to determine Ra; furthermore, appropriate bacterial species were attached to the tip to measure the adhesion forces between cells and substrates. The bacterial species chosen (Staphylococci and Streptococci) are common pathogens associated with a number of implant related infections that are detrimental to the biomedical devices and patients. Correlation between adhesion forces and surface roughness (Ra) was generally better when the surface roughness was measured through scanned areas with size (2 × 2 μm) comparable to bacteria cells. Furthermore, the BSA coating altered the surface roughness without correlation with the initial values of such parameter; therefore, better correlations were found between adhesion forces and BSA-coated surfaces when actual surface roughness was used instead of the initial (nominal) values. It was also found that BSA induced a more hydrophilic and electron donor characteristic to the surfaces; in agreement with increasing adhesion forces of hydrophilic bacteria (as determined through microbial adhesion to solvents test) on BSA-coated substrates...|$|R

The two approaches detected the same chromosomal region consisting <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> EcoRI fragments. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> these EcoRI fragments was cloned and hybridized with a cosmid library.

Sequence analysis of the two cosmid clones revealed that in the Tn 916 mutant, a gene, cps 14 E, which is homologous to other bacterial genes encoding glycosyl transferases, had been inactivated. An open reading frame immediately downstream of cps 14 E, designated cps 14 F, shows no significant homology with any known genes or proteins.

The sequence participates in <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> stem-loop structures, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which, the coat-initiator hairpin, controls coat-gene translation {{and is thus}} under strong selection pressure. We have removed 19 out of the 23 nucleotides constituting the intercistronic region, thereby destroying {{the capacity of the}} phage to build the two hairpins. The deletion lowered coat-protein yield more than 1000 -fold, and the titer of the infectious clone carrying the deletion dropped 10 orders of magnitude as compared with the wild type. Two types of revertants were recovered. One had, in two steps, recruited 18 new nucleotides that served to rebuild the two hairpins and the lost Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The other type had deleted an additional six nucleotides, which allowed the reconstruction of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiator hairpin, albeit by sacrificing the remnants of the other stem-loop. The results visualize the immense genetic repertoire created by, what appears as, random RNA recombination. It would seem that in this genetic ensemble every possible new RNA combination is represented...|$|R

In both sites, actual emission rates as well as light- and temperature-normalized emission rates (i. e., emission factor (EF)) significantly changed during the seasons: Mean EFs increased from June to July to a broad summer maximum between 5. 2 and 9. 4 nmol m(- 2) leaf area s(- 1) (12 - 21 mug g(- 1) leaf dry mass h(- 1)), dropped in October and November and reached a minimum of about 0. 77 nmol m(- 2) s(- 1) (1. 7 mug g(- 1) h(- 1)) in January. From June to July, mean EFs of the trees with reduced water supply were significantly {{lower than those of}} trees with normal water supply. The lowered EF in summer was paralleled by lower predawn water potentials, leaf transpiration, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance with respect to control trees. The results suggest that in natural Q. ilex habitats the seasonal evolution of EF follows a marked summer-winter cycle whose shape and intensity can be modified by summer drought...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of precise X-band electron paramagnetic resonance studies of zircon (ZrSiO 4) and α-quartz (SiO 2) single crystals at temperatures between 15 and 100 K, and the synthesis of the zircon crystals studied. Zircon crystals have been grown using the flux-growth technique, producing well-shaped crystals up to 4 mm in length. The technique was used to grow both doped and nominally undoped crystals. Dopants successfully incorporated into the zircon crystals were titanium, chromium, yttrium, aluminium and boron. Analysis of Ti 4 + /Y 3 + -doped zircon crystals revealed four defect centres new to the Canterbury research group. Two oxygenic hole centres have been analysed, one compensated by yttrium ([SiO 4 /Y] 0), and the other by an unknown ion ([SiO 4 /M]n). A crystal-field spin-orbit coupling analysis of hole centres with a range of g values has shown that their anisotropy may be directly related to crystal-field splittings of orbital energy levels. A Ti 3 + electron centre, Si(Ti 3 +), {{has been shown to be}} located in a silicon lattice position in contrast to an earlier-discovered Ti 3 + centre in a zirconium lattice position, Zr(Ti 3 +). Another electron centre labelled H (g∥ = 1. 9875, g⊥ = 1. 9550) has been measured,but is not yet understood. A previously observed electron centre (Z) with effective g values of 1. 9991 and 3. 9118 has been shown to be a chromium ion in a silicon lattice position. A + 3 oxidation state, and a large zero-field splitting has been inferred from an analysis of the effective g values. Two closely related boron centres have been observed in zircon crystals with relatively high boron doping, and have been interpreted as impurity electron centres in a zirconium lattice site. Both have almost identical g values gx = 1. 969, gy = 1. 981, gz = 1. 969. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the centres has the unusual point-group symmetry for defects in zircon of mm 2 (C 2 v), which is explained by <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> ions along <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the zircon fourfold rotation-inversion axes. Two centres in a-quartz have been measured and analysed. One has been interpreted as a silicon-vacancy oxygenic-hole centre, [HLi 2 O 4] 0, compensated by one hydrogen and two lithium ions. The hyperfine matrices have been analysed with some success using three different methods to ascertain the locations of the compensating nuclei. The second centre is a previously reported hydrogen-compensated iron centre in a silicon lattice site, [FeO 4 /H] 0 α. A pseudo cube analysis has been carried out in order to confirm the location of the iron ion, but the results have been found inconclusive...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} passive {{localization}} (bearing estimation and range and depth estimation) {{of a single}} stationary underwater acoustic source in a two-path (direct and surface-reflected path) environment. The main objective {{of the study is}} to synthesize and then analyze a passive localization system with a two-receiver (vertically separated) structure that can be supported by a single sonobuoy. Each of the two receivers consists of a cluster of directional sensors uniformly located on a small circle in a horizontal plane. The gain profile of the directional sensors is such that it depends only on bearing of source. Source bearing is estimated from the average signal powers received at <b>two</b> <b>adjacent</b> sensors in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two clusters. The focus in the study of bearing estimation is on the feasibility of energy-based bearing estimators. The range and depth information of the source is extracted from the 6 estimated time differences of arrivals (TDOAs) at the two receivers. The emphasis in the study of range and depth estimation is on the correlation among the multipath TDOA estimators and its effect on the prediction of the variance of the time delay-based range and depth estimators. Two algorithms for energy-based bearing estimation are developed. Expressions for the bias and variance of both energy-based bearing estimators are derived. They reveal a fairly simple relationship between the performance of the two bearing estimators and the design parameters (the omnidirectional signal-to-noise ratio and the two receiver parameters). Using the developed expressions can provide good predictions of the bias and variance of the two energy-based bearing estimators in the case of reasonable signal-to-noise ratios. The range and depth estimators are investigated with time delay techniques. Fifteen expressions for the covariance among the six multipath TDOA estimators are derived. It is shown that all six multipath TDOA estimators are correlated and the degree of the correlation depends on the power spectral density of the source signal and that of the ocean noise, and only two multipath TDOAs [...] the time difference of arrival between the direct and the surface-reflected path for each receiver. A generalized covariance equation is developed for each category. Thus, the fifteen covariance expressions can be obtained from three compact expressions. The effect of correlation among the multipath TDOA estimators on range and depth estimators is investigated. The least squares range and depth estimators, based on all six TDOA estimators, are proposed. Expressions for the variance and bias of the range and depth estimators are derived. The results in the study of range and depth estimation show that the expressions for the variance of the range and depth estimators can be in error by as much as a factor of 2. 5 without the correlation among the TDOA estimators. Including the correlation provides significantly better predicted range and depth variance. Also, the range and depth estimators are nearly unbiased. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
