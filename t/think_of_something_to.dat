60|$|Kemp {{tried to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> keep the talk going, but the Invisible Man resumed {{of his own}} accord.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. Hang it, {{he could do}} that for himself, anyway. He must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> fortify his {{position}} against that woman. And he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tell {{me about}} St Austin's, Mr MacArthur,' said Miss Beezley, as the Babe {{was trying to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say--not about the weather. 'Do you play football?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Things {{that are}} thought of: isipin (<b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something),</b> alalahanin (<b>to</b> {{remember}} <b>something).</b>|$|R

5000|$|Writer Louisa May Alcott {{criticized the}} book's {{publication}} as well, {{saying that if}} Twain [...] "not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them".|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, Klobstock would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat," [...] commented the Professor, who prided {{himself on}} his ready wit. This raised a laugh against Klobstock, and pleased the Professor.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood looking}} at the girl, and trying in vain to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say. Miss Hartley, with {{somewhat}} more colour than usual, gave him a little bow and hurried off.|$|E
6000|$|... "But surely, surely," [...] she {{repeated}} with growing, obstinate vehemence, [...] "you can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do [...] . . . {{you have the}} means [...] . . . you are rich [...] . . . have you no enthusiasms, milor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "John," [...] {{said the}} Major, exhibiting this letter, [...] "you're {{on the wrong}} tack. The man is {{justified}} in thinking we're crazy. Give up this idea and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> bother me." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Wrenn sat trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> say. Lonely {{people in}} city {{restaurants}} {{simply do not}} get acquainted. Yet he did manage to observe, [...] "Great building that'll be," [...] in the friendliest manner.|$|R
60|$|He {{began again}} {{to walk up}} and down, prey to an {{agitation}} that was frightful to behold. Susie and Dr Porhoët stared at him helplessly. They tried to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say that would calm him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} had a narrow escape of my life,' gasped the jackal, 'and I need some sleep. After that we must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do to amuse ourselves.' And he lay down again and slept soundly {{for a couple of}} hours.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it will be}} rain by morning," [...] another predicted, and {{the girl}} tried hard to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say {{in support of the}} hit she had made already. But she could not, and was silent almost through the whole first course at dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, I almost {{wish that}} you were a soldier, too," [...] she declared. [...] "Your work seems to me so horribly gruesome. Come along, you know you are going to take me <b>to</b> dinner. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> nice <b>to</b> say. I really want to be amused." ...|$|R
60|$|Six silent men, {{the host}} leading, the two husbands {{bringing}} up the rear, ascended the stairs, each with the sensation of being twice his usual weight. Six silent men entered the drawing-room {{and sat down on}} chairs. Six silent men tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> interesting <b>to</b> say.|$|R
5000|$|... "Id already played {{every song}} I knew and I was stalling, {{asking for more}} guitar and mic, trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> play - {{and then it just}} came to me...The {{establishment}} was foolish enough to give us all this freedom and we used it in every way we could." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{kept her}} head turned from him. Somehow or other, she divined quite well {{what was in}} his mind. She tried to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> say, something to dispel the seriousness which she felt {{to be in the}} atmosphere, but words failed her. It was he who broke the silence.|$|E
60|$|They passed {{several of}} the little stone and log houses, and women greeted them as they went by and {{children}} peered shyly from the doors. He kept trying to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say, and, failing in that, determined to have one good look under the hood before he left her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{disappoint}} me, Nigel," [...] she said. [...] "I {{hate to see}} a man weaken. There {{is nothing}} against you. Don't act as though there could be. As to this little house-party you were speaking of, I only wish I could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> help you. By the by, what are you doing to-night?" ...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{questions}} involved {{in communication with}} Extraterrestrials. One is the mechanical issue of discovering a mutually acceptable channel. The other is the more philosophical problem (semantic, ethic, and metaphysical) of the proper subject matter for discourse. In simpler terms, we first require a common language, and then we must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> clever <b>to</b> say...|$|R
5000|$|... "At her {{retirement}} party, {{a college professor}} rises to tell her colleagues: 'I wish I could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> nice <b>to</b> say about you people and this university. I really do. But the truth we dare not utter is that ours is a distinctly second-rate institution, as are {{the vast majority of}} our students, as are we.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Spotty {{knew that}} Billy Mink was {{making fun of}} him, but he is too good-natured to lose his temper over a little thing like that. He tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> smart <b>to</b> say in reply, but Spotty is a slow thinker {{as well as a}} slow walker, and before he could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything, Billy was talking once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are in luck, Miss Pellissier," [...] he declared. [...] "Your success here is {{absolutely}} meteoric. Miss Ellicot {{has spoken to}} you, the great Mr. Bullding is going to. For five minutes he {{has been trying to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say. I am not sure, but I believe that he has just thought of something." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nelly and Miss Proudfoot and Tom Poppins began {{discussing}} shoe-stores, all at {{once and}} very rapidly, while hot and uncomfortable Mr. Wrenn tried to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say.... Good Lord, suppose Istra [...] "queered" [...] him at Mrs. Arty's!... Then he was angry at himself {{and all of them}} for not appreciating her. How exquisite she looked, with her tired white face! ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{a natural}} impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale of distress, to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say by way of consolation. Emmeline wanted to say something, {{but she could not}} think of {{anything}} to say. What was there to be said? As by a common consent, they both avoided, with fear and dread, all mention of the horrible man who was now their master.|$|E
60|$|Sam smiled expectantly {{and took}} a seat. He heard his new friend order a pot, and wiping his mouth {{on the back of}} his hand, tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> nice <b>to</b> say as he drank it. Then his blood froze in his veins, and his jaw dropped as the other came from the counter and held out half a loaf.|$|R
6000|$|Grandfather Frog almost choked again, {{he was so}} angry. You see old Mr. Toad's {{remarks were}} very {{personal}}, and nobody likes personal remarks when they are unpleasant, especially if {{they happen to be}} true. Grandfather Frog was trying his best <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> sharp <b>to</b> say in reply, when Mr. Redwing, sitting {{in the top of the}} big hickory-tree, shouted: [...] "Here comes Farmer Brown's boy!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{title of}} the song is {{borrowed}} by Nicky, [...] "The Everlasting", is also a title from a poem by his brother Patrick Jones, after he spent some time trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> similar <b>to</b> Blur's [...] "The Universal" [...] or Joy Division's [...] "The Eternal". [...] "The Everlasting" [...] {{is often described as}} grand, elegiac and in some ways quite profoundly sad.|$|R
60|$|The lodger and Emily 'ad gone inside, and Joseph stood there, fidgeting, {{while the}} cabman asked Bill, as a friend, why he 'adn't paid twopence more for his face, and Bill was wasting his {{time trying to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to 'urt the cabman's feelings. Then he took Bill by the arm as the cab drove off and told 'im not to say nothing about the dream, because {{he was going to}} risk it.|$|E
60|$|The mate noticed, with {{a strong}} sense of his own unworthiness, that the two ladies seemed {{thoroughly}} engrossed in each other’s company, and oblivious to all else. A suggestion from Flower that he should close up and take off Miss Wheeler, seemed to him to border upon audacity, but he meekly followed Flower as that bold mariner ranged himself alongside the girls, and taking two steps on the curb and three in the gutter, walked along for some time trying to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E
6000|$|I {{tried to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say, but nothing came. A chappie {{has to be}} a lot broader about the {{forehead}} than I am to handle a jolt like this. I strained the old bean till it creaked, but between the collar and the hair parting nothing stirred. I was dumb. Which was lucky, because I wouldn't {{have had a chance to}} get any persiflage out of my system. Lady Malvern collared the conversation. She had been bottling it up, and now it came out with a rush: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How is your ankle?" [...] said Rilla. Oh, why couldn't she <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> say? She knew he {{was sick}} of {{inquiries}} about his ankle. She had heard him say so at Ingleside--heard him tell Di {{he was going to}} wear a placard on his breast announcing to all and sundry that the ankle was improving, etc. And now she must go and ask this stale question again.|$|R
6000|$|When Peter <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> do he wastes no time. Off he started, lipperty-lipperty-lip, for the Smiling Pool. He kept {{close to}} the edge of the Green Forest until he reached the place where the Laughing Brook comes out of the Green Forest on its way to the Smiling Pool in the Green Meadows. Bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the Laughing Brook at this point. The ground was soft in places, quite muddy. Peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp, so he hopped along carelessly. From right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound. It startled Peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head. He had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes. Then Peter chuckled. [...] "I declare," [...] said he, [...] "I had forgotten all about my old friend, Longbill the Woodcock. He scared me for a second." ...|$|R
6000|$|She tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else, and <b>to</b> {{get away}} from this talk of a sail to Leyden, but she fatally answered, [...] "I saw your boat this afternoon. I had n't noticed before that it was still here." ...|$|R
