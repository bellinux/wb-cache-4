40|$|Abstract—An {{efficient}} {{management of the}} resources in Grid computing crucially depends on the efficient mapping of <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> resources according to the user’s requirements. Grid resources scheduling {{has become a challenge}} in the computational Grid. The mapping of <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> appropriate resources for execution of the application in Grid computing is an NP-Complete problem. In this paper, hyper-heuristic based resource scheduling algorithm is designed <b>to</b> effectively schedule <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> on available resources in a Grid environment. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the GridSim toolkit. Empirical results illustrate that our algorithm outperformed the existing algorithm by minimizing cost and makespan of user’s submitted applications...|$|R

When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives {{with a few of}} his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before they are about to kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them.

5|$|As part of baseball's {{expansion}} in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, {{to play in the}} National League beginning in 1962, and {{to be known as the}} New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of The New York Times suggested that Stengel took <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> give something back to the game that had been his life for half a century.|$|E

Allardyce's success with Bolton {{resulted in the}} FA putting him on a short-list of four people to succeed Sven-Göran Eriksson as England manager after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, alongside Alan Curbishley, Steve McClaren and Martin O'Neill. He was interviewed for the position and was told by FA Chief Executive Brian Barwick that the final choice would be between him and McClaren, however the FA eventually decided to give <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> McClaren. Allardyce was also again offered the Newcastle job and was this time to keen to take it, but Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepard broke off contract negotiations after electing to appoint caretaker-manager Glenn Roeder on a full-time basis. Allardyce's team seemed unaffected by speculation on his future or by their European exploits, and ended the season in eighth position.|$|E
5|$|Ebert spent a {{semester}} as a master's {{student in the}} department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the Sun-Times in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the Sun-Times for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun-Times in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> Ebert. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.|$|E

Ryan openly goofs off in front of Pam and Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits.

5|$|The {{first modern}} historians {{to deal with}} the reign of Edward II – William Stubbs, Thomas Frederick Tout and James Conway Davies – added little to the {{understanding}} of Gaveston. While generally agreeing with the chronicles, they allotted him no importance within their own main field of interest, that of constitutional history. For later generations of historians, the focus shifted from constitutional to personal issues. From the 1970s onwards, the topic of study became the personal relations between magnates and the crown, and the distribution of patronage. It is to this school of thought that Hamilton's biography belongs, in which he argues that it was Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage that was {{the driving force behind the}} baronial animosity towards him. Chaplais, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the study of Gaveston and his place in the reign of Edward II. According to Chaplais, Edward was more or less indifferent to the practice of kingship, and essentially delegated <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> Gaveston. As an alternative to a homosexual relationship, Chaplais suggests that the bond that existed between the King and Gaveston was that of an adoptive brotherhood. This concept had a Biblical precedent in the traditionalist, platonic interpretation of the relationship between David and Jonathan, and also existed in the Middle Ages, as exemplified in The Song of Roland, the story of Roland and Olivier.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of the construction was flawed from the start: the stem and sternposts, rudder frame, and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time, and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress.

The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament {{that the government was}} willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop.

5|$|Metallica {{released}} {{their debut}} album Kill 'Em All on the independent label Megaforce Records in July 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material and from September began performing {{the songs that}} were to make up Ride the Lightning at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing clubs across the US. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar so the band offered <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, founder of Sweet Silence, {{who went on to}} produce the band's next two albums. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen because he liked his work on Rainbow's Difficult to Cure (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at Mercyful Fate's practice room in Copenhagen.|$|E
