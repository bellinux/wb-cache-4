With its [...] "seasick synths" [...] as well as [...] "bits of arena rock guitar and girlish harmonies", the heavy, playfully sad [...] "Future Sick" [...] manages to convey [...] "the feeling of growing older in a world that's growing faster than you are". It depicts Palomo lamenting [...] "mid-volume under his own creation's drunken abstraction" [...] about wanting <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> past, because thinking of the future is making him ill. It is at this point where, according to The Observer, some of the wooziness that Era Extraña takes from Psychic Chasms [...] "veers into nausea". Mitchell described the instrumentation of [...] "Suns Irrupt" [...] as [...] "hypnotic and firework fizzling synths with a woozy synth background".
