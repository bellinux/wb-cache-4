Longitudinal link, <b>transverse</b> <b>link</b> and the TSH hinge are set up with four nodes that are fully integrated to reduce shell elements (S 4 R). Rope is modeled by two nodes and three dimensional elements (T 3 D 2). Weld is defined to model connection between ropes and transverse links. Reference point (RP) is established at each joint which are given mass and inertial properties. Multi-point coupling is applied to model the connection of transverse links. The joint hinges are modeled by defining Hinge connection. Contact of tape springs are modeled by defining Tie constraint.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a HOMFLY {{polynomial}} is found for knots and links in a lens space L(p, q). Further {{study of this}} polynomial invariant finds {{a relationship with the}} classical invariants of Legendrian and <b>transverse</b> <b>links,</b> when L(p, q) is endowed with a universally tight contact structure. In fact certain criteria are found which, if satisfied by any numerical invariant of links in L(p, q), guarantee that the invariant fits into a Bennequin type inequality. A linear function of the degree of the HOMFLY polynomial is then shown to satisfy these criteria. A corollary is that certain “simple” Legendrian and transverse realizations of knots admitting grid number one diagrams maximize the classical invariants in their knot type. In order to obtain the above results, formulae are found for computing the classical invariants of Legendrian and <b>transverse</b> <b>links</b> from a toroidal front projection. Having these formulae, and known results about fibered links that support a given contact structure, it is found whether the duals of some families of Berge knots support the universally tight contact structure...|$|R

40|$|We report {{results of}} {{numerical}} and analytical {{studies of the}} spontaneous symmetry breaking in solitons, both two- and one-dimensional, which are trapped in H-shaped potential profiles, built of two parallel potential troughs linked by a narrow rung in the transverse direction. This system can be implemented in self-attractive Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), {{as well as in}} a nonlinear bulk optical waveguide. We demonstrate that the introduction of the <b>transverse</b> <b>link</b> changes the character of the symmetry-breaking bifurcation (SBB) in the system from subcritical to supercritical (in terms of the corresponding phase transition, it is a change {{between the first and second}} kinds). A noteworthy feature of the SBB in this setting is a non-monotonous dependence of the soliton's norm at the bifurcation point on the strength of the <b>transverse</b> <b>link.</b> In the full 2 D system, the results are obtained in a numerical form. An exact analytical solution is found for the bifurcation in the 1 D version of the model, with the transverse rung modeled by the local linear coupling between the parallel troughs with the Delta-functional longitudinal profile. Replacing the Delta-function by its finite-width Gaussian counterpart, similar results are obtained by means of the variational approximation (VA). The VA is also applied to the 1 D system with a mixed linear and nonlinear transverse localized coupling. Comparison of the results produced by the different varieties of the system clearly reveals basic features of the symmetry-breaking transition in it.

40|$|Existence, {{stability}} and dynamics of soliton complexes, centered {{at the site}} of a single <b>transverse</b> <b>link</b> connecting two parallel 2 D (two-dimensional) lattices, are investigated. The system with the on-site cubic self-focusing nonlinearity is modeled by the pair of discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations linearly coupled at the single site. Symmetric, antisymmetric and asymmetric complexes are constructed by means of the variational approximation (VA) and numerical methods. The VA demonstrates that the antisymmetric soliton complexes exist in the entire parameter space, while the symmetric and asymmetric modes can be found below a critical value of the coupling parameter. Numerical results confirm these predictions. The symmetric complexes are destabilized via a supercritical symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation, which gives rise to stable asymmetric modes. The antisymmetric complexes are subject to oscillatory and exponentially instabilities in narrow parametric regions. In bistability areas, stable antisymmetric solitons coexist with either symmetric or asymmetric ones. Comment: 9 figure...|$|E

We investigate the string tension and glueball spectrum, comparing with Euclidean Lattice Monte Carlo data. 1. Transverse Lattices A {{number of years ago}} Bardeen and Pearson [1] formulated a light-front Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory, which makes use of the fact that two components of the gauge field are unphysical. In this approach two spacetime dimensions are continuous while the remaining ‘transverse’ spatial dimensions are discretised on a lattice. An empirical study [2] of SU(∞) gauge theory in (3 + 1) -dimensions produced a rough glueball spectrum, but results were inconclusive. In this exploratory study we bring more recent techniques and ideas to bear on this problem, choosing pure SU(∞) Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions as a trial. We shall unashamedly use as a benchmark the Euclidean Lattice Monte Carlo (ELMC) glueball results of Teper [3]. We have applied analytic and numerical techniques to measure the transverse string tension and glueball spectrum, as well as many other observables not described here.
