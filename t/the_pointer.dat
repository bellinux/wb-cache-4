5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E
5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
25|$|This is why <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> {{placement}} delete {{functions are}} defined as no-operations by the Standard C++ library. Since <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> placement new functions do not allocate any storage, there is no storage to be deallocated {{in the event of}} the object's constructor throwing an exception.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] method {{effectively}} stores {{the position}} of <b>the</b> position <b>pointer</b> by setting <b>the</b> mark <b>pointer</b> to <b>the</b> position of <b>the</b> position <b>pointer.</b> <b>The</b> [...] method causes <b>the</b> position <b>pointer</b> to move to <b>the</b> mark <b>pointer's</b> position.|$|R
50|$|In the {{southern}} hemisphere, Alpha Centauri forms the outer star of <b>The</b> <b>Pointers</b> or <b>The</b> Southern <b>Pointers,</b> so called because the line through Beta Centauri (Hadar/Agena),some 4.5° west, points {{directly to the}} constellation Crux—the Southern Cross. <b>The</b> <b>Pointers</b> easily distinguish <b>the</b> true Southern Cross from the fainter asterism known as the False Cross.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Pointers</b> {{softball}} team had a 24-11 (8-6, WIAC) record. The {{team won the}} WIAC title in 2001. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Pointers</b> won <b>the</b> Division III National Championship. The {{softball team}} plays its home games at University Field.|$|R
25|$|There were {{probably}} {{several types of}} south-pointing chariot which worked differently. In {{most or all of}} them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a geared mechanism to keep <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. <b>The</b> <b>pointer</b> was aimed southward by hand {{at the start of a}} journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional dead reckoning, which is inherently prone to cumulative errors and uncertainties. Some chariots' mechanisms may have had differential gears. If so, it was probably the first use of differentials anywhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} 1990–91 {{version of}} the show used a redesigned {{version of the}} Star Wheel. The wheel itself was stationary, and the contestant spun <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> on a concentric ring to determine which celebrity he/she had to match. The prize was doubled if <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> stopped on either of two circles within each section.|$|E
25|$|The Metonic {{train is}} driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is {{connected}} to <b>the</b> <b>pointer.</b> The modelled rotational period of <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.|$|E

25|$|Moving <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> a long distance: When a {{practical}} limit of mouse movement is reached, one lifts up the mouse, brings {{it to the}} opposite edge of the working area while it is held above the surface, and then replaces it down onto the working surface. This is often not necessary, because acceleration software detects fast movement, and moves <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> significantly faster in proportion than for slow mouse motion.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pointer</b> Sisters are an American R singing {{group from}} Oakland, California, who {{achieved}} mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s.

The group had 13 US top 20 hits between 1973 and 1985.|$|E
50|$|The {{locations}} {{of all other}} fields in the frame can be defined relative either {{to the top of}} the frame, as negative offsets of <b>the</b> stack <b>pointer,</b> or relative {{to the top of the}} frame below, as positive offsets of <b>the</b> frame <b>pointer.</b> <b>The</b> location of <b>the</b> frame <b>pointer</b> itself must inherently be defined as a negative offset of <b>the</b> stack <b>pointer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {{then the}} {{compiler}} {{is allowed to}} assume that , , and [...] point to different locations and updating one pointer will not affect <b>the</b> other <b>pointers.</b> <b>The</b> programmer, not the compiler, is responsible for ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>pointers</b> do not point to identical locations.|$|R
50|$|When stack {{frame sizes}} can differ, such as between {{different}} functions or between invocations {{of a particular}} function, popping a frame off the stack does not constitute a fixed decrement of <b>the</b> stack <b>pointer.</b> At function return, <b>the</b> stack <b>pointer</b> is instead restored to <b>the</b> frame <b>pointer,</b> <b>the</b> value of <b>the</b> stack <b>pointer</b> just before <b>the</b> function was called. Each stack frame contains a stack <b>pointer</b> to <b>the</b> top of the frame immediately below. <b>The</b> stack <b>pointer</b> is a mutable register shared between all invocations. A frame pointer of a given invocation of a function is a copy of <b>the</b> stack <b>pointer</b> {{as it was before}} the function was invoked.|$|R

50|$|The {{correctness}} of {{the algorithm}} {{can be seen}} as follows. Suppose we have a solution a + b + c = 0. Since <b>the</b> <b>pointers</b> only move in one direction, we can run the algorithm until <b>the</b> leftmost <b>pointer</b> points to a. Run the algorithm until either one of <b>the</b> remaining <b>pointers</b> points to b or c, whichever occurs first. Then the algorithm will run until <b>the</b> last <b>pointer</b> points to <b>the</b> remaining term, giving the affirmative solution.|$|R

25|$|The Metonic Dial is {{the main}} upper dial on {{the rear of the}} mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several {{physical}} units, is 235 synodic months, which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in 5 rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on <b>the</b> <b>pointer</b> that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. <b>The</b> <b>pointer</b> points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the Corinthian month names.|$|E
