5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works.

5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice.

Ogdensburg declared <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> a borough historic site in 1991. A flood in 2000 which caused two nearby dams to burst damaged <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A book was published in 2009 about the history of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|R
50|$|More than 500 miners sunk four 20 m-deep shafts to {{the level}} of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> floor. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> was driven from the bottom of these shafts and from <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> portals. Two of the shafts were later used for the {{ventilation}} of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> was completely lined with 8,900 m³ of Elbe Sandstone to reduce the water inflow.|$|R

5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E
5|$|East of {{this station}} on the BMT side, the planned track {{connections}} to the Second Avenue Subway curved slightly north.

When she first goes into the cave, she is saved by Fallen Leaves, the spirit of an ancient cat who died in <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> and lives with him for the remainder of her time in the caves. The novella describes various ways in which she continues to help ThunderClan during her absence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the predawn}} hours of July 29, the 7th Cavalry Regiment withdrew from No Gun Ri.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{has created}} {{problems}} of its own. The toads originally refused to use <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and so <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was lit to encourage its use. The toads then {{died from the}} heat of the lamps inside <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Once through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> <b>the</b> toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground. The exit to <b>the</b> toad <b>tunnel</b> has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.|$|R
50|$|Tunnels are dug in {{types of}} {{materials}} varying from soft clay to hard rock. <b>The</b> method of <b>tunnel</b> construction depends on {{such factors as}} the ground conditions, the ground water conditions, the length and diameter of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> drive, <b>the</b> depth of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> <b>the</b> logistics of supporting <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> excavation, <b>the</b> final use and shape of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and appropriate risk management.|$|R
50|$|Tunnel 8 {{is located}} at 152.8 km. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{contains}} straight and curved line with a length close to 153 metres. The spandrels of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> portals are infilled with regular coursed quarry-faced sandstone. Sandstone segments form the arched entrance of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> <b>The</b> entrance portal is crowned by a stepped deck with missing sections of cornicing. The exit portal has a straight deck and cornice. Internally, the arched ceiling of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> is lined in different sections with brick and smooth-faced stone. From mid-height a coarsely dressed stone wall extends {{to the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A side gallery, approximately presently obscured by vegetation, is set high into the hillside above the access road that skirts the hill containing <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> is approximately 10 metres in length, 2.5 metres wide and 2.6 metres high. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> is unlined but its connection with <b>the</b> railway <b>tunnel</b> is arched.|$|R
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in <b>the</b> <b>tunnels.</b> To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|The loop itself still exists, {{although}} it was penetrated by a bomb and flooded during the Blitz in the Second World War. Fortunately, the loop had been sealed off years before. In September 1938, during the Sudeten Crisis, when war appeared imminent, the Bakerloo and Northern line tunnels at Embankment were temporarily sealed with concrete to protect against flooding through bombing. The blockage was removed after {{little more than a}} week once the crisis had passed. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> were blocked again until electrically powered emergency doors could be installed in the tunnel mouths. <b>The</b> <b>tunnels</b> reopened in December 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{technologies}} of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size and depth of <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> have a limited loading gauge and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Boßler <b>Tunnel</b> is {{a railway}} tunnel {{currently}} under construction {{as part of}} the new Wendlingen-Ulm high-speed railway. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> is approximately 8806 m long, built as two parallel single-track <b>tunnels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> runs between Aichelberg and Mühlhausen im Täle under the Roter Wasen and the Boßler mountain.

50|$|On October 29, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{suffered}} severe flooding from Hurricane Sandy. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was closed}} to all train service while repairs were being made. Service in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was restored using temporary equipment on December 21. However, the MTA had announced that a complete reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> systems was needed, so <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was closed {{for a second time}} on August 2, 2013. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> was completely closed during that time.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{were built}} {{by more than}} 300,000 local citizens, {{including}} school students, on volunteer duties. Some portions were even dug {{without the help of}} any heavy machinery. Centuries-old city walls, towers and gates, including the old city gates of Xizhimen, Fuchengmen, and Chongwenmen were destroyed to supply construction materials for the complex.|$|E
5|$|To {{avoid the}} need to {{purchase}} agreements for running under surface buildings, <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At {{the northern end of}} the railway, {{the need to}} pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required {{to the west of the}} station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. <b>The</b> <b>tunnels</b> converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.|$|E
5|$|While in <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was also}} used {{as a way for}} Bosnians and UN forces to get out of Sarajevo. Transit each way, both into the city and out of the city, was constant. Every day, between 3000 and 4,000 Bosnian and UN {{soldiers}} (as well as civilians) and 30 tons of various goods passed through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> [...] Groups travelling through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> ranged in size from 20 to 1,000 people. On average, it took 2 hours for these groups to travel through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Throughout <b>the</b> war, between two million and three million trips of Bosnians and UN soldiers were made through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and a number of Bosnian civilians used <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to flee Sarajevo. Those who traveled through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> included soldiers, civilians, politicians, and generals. Alija Izetbegović, President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is the most notable individual who used <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> He was carried through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> on a chair called the [...] "President's Chair" [...] and thus never actually laid foot in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Black Rock <b>Tunnel</b> was {{constructed}} between 1835 and 1837 and opened in 1838. W. Hasell Wilson was the resident engineer in charge.
