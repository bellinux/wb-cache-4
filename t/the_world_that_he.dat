25|$|A new Customs House, {{built in}} {{classical}} revival style, was opened in 1902 adjoining the original 1815 Bond Store.

A telephone exchange was added in 1907.

25|$|In 1934, Hitler named Ribbentrop Special Commissioner for Disarmament. In {{his early}} years, Hitler's goal {{in foreign affairs}} was to persuade <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished to reduce {{military}} spending by making idealistic but very vague disarmament offers (in the 1930s, the term disarmament was used to describe arms-limitation agreements). At the same time, the Germans always resisted making concrete arms-limitations proposals, and they went ahead with increased military spending on grounds that other powers would not take up German arms-limitation offers. Ribbentrop was tasked with ensuring that the world remained convinced that Germany sincerely wanted an arms-limitation treaty while also ensuring that no such treaty was ever developed.|$|E

25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} he joins the Legion, Superboy's life is {{threatened}} when a Green Kryptonite meteor falls to Earth, but his life is saved by a Smallville farm boy named Lex Luthor, {{who also happens to}} be a science prodigy. The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E

Virgil, in the Divine Comedy, leads Dante through Hell (Inferno) and Purgatory (Purgatorio), but cannot guide him into Paradise (Paradiso). In this context, Virgil {{was a symbol}} of non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God. [...] In Eliot's depiction, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing [...] "the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy".|$|E

LeMond continued, [...] "I decided that day that nobody's going to keep me from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody." [...] At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called and threatened to disclose publicly that LeMond was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, should he appear in court as scheduled the following day.

500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} {{and takes}} out a Jenny Craig Anytime Bar from his shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing that he had been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would ever have a gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E
500|$|In the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist {{criticism}} dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said {{devoted a}} chapter of his book Culture and Imperialism (1993) to Mansfield Park, arguing that the peripheral position of [...] "Antigua" [...] {{and the issue of}} slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether Mansfield Park justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about Mansfield Park and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about Mansfield Park reflecting the [...] "spatial" [...] understanding of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay [...] "'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' Mansfield Parks Colonial Unconscious" [...] argued that the [...] "barbarism" [...] of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the [...] "barbarism" [...] of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the [...] "barbarism" [...] and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their [...] "place", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper [...] "place". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to Mansfield Park, writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.|$|E
