However, there are several drawbacks in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> this category in previous studies. The main problem is that they lack a scientific design of experiments, which leads to robust results that can be statistically trusted. In other words, most of the available studies did not undergo statistical analysis to prove that their designed ANN would significantly improve the results (Lam 2004).|$|R

A Comparative Study on Teaching Top-down and Bottom-up <b>Techniques</b> <b>of</b> Reading (A Quasi-Experimental Study at 8 th Grade of SMP N 5 Surakarta in the Academic Year 2012 / 2013). A thesis. Surakarta : Faculty of Teacher Training and Education of Sebelas Maret University, 2013. The aims of this {{research}} are to find out: (1) {{whether there is a}} significant difference in reading comprehension achievement between the students taught <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading and those taught <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading; (2) whether <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading is more effective than <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading. This quasi-experimental study used 29 students for the experimental group and 29 students for the control group. The data were analyzed by using t-test formula. The computation of the data shows that the t-observation (to) is 2. 42, which is higher than the t-table (56, 0. 05) : 1. 960. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a significant difference in reading comprehension achievement between the students taught <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading and those taught <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading. <b>The</b> mean of the group of students who are taught <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading is 79. 4, while that of those who are taught <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading is 76. 78. Therefore,it can be concluded that <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading is more effective to be used than <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading for junior high school students...|$|R
