25|$|The stages model, {{which came}} {{about in the}} 1960s, is a theory based on {{observation}} {{of people who are}} dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one. This model found empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al. The research of George Bonanno, however, is acknowledged as inadvertently debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show {{that the vast majority of}} people who have experienced a loss do not grieve, but are resilient. The logic is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no grief, there are no stages to pass through.|$|E

A minor who is over seven years of age has limited capacity to make juridical acts. A married minor has the capacity to make juridical acts. A juridical person is established only according to this code or any other acts. A juridical act which is against public policy or morals is void.|$|E

25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E

500|$|The {{analogy of}} games– most {{commonly}} associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein– has been proposed {{as a way of}} establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed {{to solve the problem of}} meaning in religious language. R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of [...] "bliks"– unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established– which are not necessarily meaningless. Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable.

500|$|Bell et al. {{wrote that}} while there was an ongoing debate over the origins of homosexuality, there is {{evidence}} supporting the view that homosexuality has a biological basis, and that hormonal factors could be involved. Though they acknowledged that their study {{did not have the}} necessary data to explain how sexual preference might be related to biology, Bell et al. wrote that their findings were consistent with what one would expect to find if sexual preference had a biological basis. They suggested that biological factors probably have a more powerful influence on exclusive homosexuals than on bisexuals, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a biological basis to homosexuality, it probably accounts for gender nonconformity as well as sexual orientation. They also proposed that the [...] "familial factors commonly thought to account for homosexuality" [...] may actually result from the way parents react to their prehomosexual children. Bell et al. argued that demonstrating that homosexuality is biologically innate would lead to greater social tolerance, and help to relieve parents of gay people of guilt. They expressed hope that researchers would eventually produce more definitive answers about the origins of homosexuality.|$|E
