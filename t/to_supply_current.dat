25|$|The United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter Onondaga {{was built}} at Cleveland, Ohio in 1898 by the Globe Iron Works. She was a steel-hulled vessel {{equipped}} with a triple-expansion steam engine, Scotch boilers, and a single screw. She {{was one of the}} first RCS cutters built with electric generators <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> for lights and call bells. Before Onondaga could be completed, she was transferred to U.S. Navy control because of the outbreak of the Spanish–American War on 24 March 1898 and the contractor was directed to cut the ship in half for transport to Ogdensburg, New York. She was reassembled and was finally accepted for service by the government 13 August and returned to Department of the Treasury control on 17 August at the conclusion of hostilities. She was placed in commission 24 October at Ogdensburg and ordered to report for duty at Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E

Unlike other systems, such as Märklin H0 (still produced today) and Hornby Railways, the outer tracks were insulated, using the centre rail as a common pick-up. This allowed the independent operation of two model engines on the same track and even three if overhead catenary wires were used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first public}} {{demonstration}} of a [...] "alternator system" [...] {{took place in}} 1886. Large two-phase alternating current generators were built by a British electrician, J. E. H. Gordon, in 1882. Lord Kelvin and Sebastian Ferranti also developed early alternators, producing frequencies between 100 and 300 hertz. After 1891, polyphase alternators were introduced <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>currents</b> of multiple differing phases.

50|$|With the {{sub-station}} {{being located}} in Woolston, roughly halfway between both termini of the electrified section, the greatest distance travelled {{by the current}} {{was a little more}} than 3 mi. As the entire line was double-tracked, {{with the exception of the}} tunnel, there were two parallel paths <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> to, including some electrified sidings. The total length of electrified track was 10.8 mi, including 4.3 mi of double-track and 2.2 mi of single-track. Section isolators were fitted at the end of the tunnel and the entrance to Christchurch station so the central section could be operated independently if necessary.|$|E
50|$|Horse-drawn trams {{operated}} in Brisbane from August 1885, operated by an English company, Metropolitan Tramway and Investment Co. Ltd. The first public {{supply of electricity}} in Brisbane was from a generator in Edison Lane, which supplied the General Post Office in 1888. Early development in the industry was {{in the hands of}} a number of private companies and the situation was complex because the metropolitan area comprised fourteen separate local authorities. After various liquidations and restructurings the City Electric Light Company Limited (CEL) was established in 1904. Parallel development took place in electric traction. The Brisbane Tramways Company, a private enterprise formed in 1895, introduced the first electric trams to Brisbane in 1897 after purchasing the early horse car system, converting it to electric operation and expanding and extending the routes. A power station <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> to the electric trams was constructed in Countess Street in 1897.|$|E

30|$|The {{first set}} of {{experiments}} was carried out to deeply characterize the capability of the emulator <b>to</b> measure the <b>current</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> the powered device. For this purpose the emulator was programmed to generate a constant output in terms of voltage and, at the same time, <b>to</b> measure the <b>supplied</b> <b>current.</b> Understanding the capability <b>to</b> measure the <b>supplied</b> <b>current</b> is crucial because an error on its determination will introduce an obvious approximation on the model computation which results on a gap between emulation and reality regardless of the approximation of the implemented model.|$|R

50|$|Sulfation {{occurs in}} {{lead-acid}} batteries {{when they are}} subjected to insufficient charging during normal operation. It impedes recharging; sulfate deposits ultimately expand, cracking the plates and destroying the battery. Eventually {{so much of the}} battery plate area is unable <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> that the battery capacity is greatly reduced. In addition, the sulfate portion (of the lead sulfate) is not returned to the electrolyte as sulfuric acid. It is believed that large crystals physically block the electrolyte from entering the pores of the plates. Sulfation can be avoided if the battery is fully recharged immediately after a discharge cycle. A white coating on the plates may be visible (in batteries with clear cases, or after dismantling the battery). Batteries that are sulfated show a high internal resistance and can deliver {{only a small fraction of}} normal discharge current. Sulfation also affects the charging cycle, resulting in longer charging times, less efficient and incomplete charging, and higher battery temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{transition}} from a non-conducting to a conductive state produces a brief emission of light and a sharp crack or snapping sound. A spark is created when the applied electric field exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of the intervening medium. For air, the breakdown strength is about 30 kV/cm at sea level. At the beginning stages, free electrons in the gap (from cosmic rays or background radiation) are accelerated by the electrical field. As they collide with air molecules, they create additional ions and newly freed electrons which are also accelerated. At some point, thermal energy will provide a much greater source of ions. The exponentially-increasing electrons and ions rapidly cause regions of {{the air in the}} gap to become electrically conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown. Once the gap breaks down, current flow is limited by the available charge (for an electrostatic discharge) or by the impedance of the external power supply. If the power supply continues <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>current,</b> the spark will evolve into a continuous discharge called an electric arc. An electric spark can also occur within insulating liquids or solids, but the breakdown mechanisms are significantly different than for sparks in gases.|$|E

50|$|The {{generation}} of alternative energy {{on the scale}} needed to replace fossil energy, {{in an effort to}} reverse global climate change, is likely to have significant negative environmental impacts. For example, biomass energy generation would have to increase 7-fold <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> primary energy demand, and up to 40-fold by 2100 given economic and energy growth projections. Humans already appropriate 30 to 40% of all photosynthetically fixed carbon worldwide, indicating that expansion of additional biomass harvesting is likely to stress ecosystems, in some cases precipitating collapse and extinction of animal species that have been deprived of vital food sources. The total amount of energy capture by vegetation in the United States each year is around 58 quads (61.5 EJ), about half of which is already harvested as agricultural crops and forest products. The remaining biomass is needed to maintain ecosystem functions and diversity. Since annual energy use in the United States is ca. 100 quads, biomass energy could supply only a very small fraction. To supply the current worldwide energy demand solely with biomass would require more than 10% of the Earth’s land surface, which is comparable to the area use for all of world agriculture (i.e., ca. 1500 million hectares), indicating that further expansion of biomass energy generation will be difficult without precipitating an ethical conflict, given current world hunger statistics, over growing plants for biofuel versus food.|$|E

5000|$|The three general {{categories}} of modern UPS systems are on-line, line-interactive and standby. An on-line UPS uses a [...] "double conversion" [...] method of accepting AC input, rectifying to DC for {{passing through the}} rechargeable battery (or battery strings), then inverting back to 120 V/230 V AC for powering the protected equipment. A line-interactive UPS maintains the inverter in line and redirects the battery's DC current path from the normal charging mode <b>to</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>current</b> when power is lost. In a standby ("off-line") system the load is powered directly by the input power and the backup power circuitry is only invoked when the utility power fails.
