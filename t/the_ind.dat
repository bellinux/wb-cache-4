5|$|At East Broadway on <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Sixth Avenue Line (under Rutgers Street at this station), {{part of a}} two-track {{station was}} built for <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Worth Street Line under East Broadway, above the {{existing}} line. Most of the constructed portion {{is now part of}} the mezzanine.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the subway}} system was unified, with the IRT and the BMT coming under city control. Consequently, {{plans for the}} {{proposed}} line were modified. The current plans were drawn up in the 1960s under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Program For Action. Under this plan, the line was to connect to <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Sixth Avenue and BMT Broadway Lines. As such, the line connecting to <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Sixth Avenue Line is <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> 63rd Street Line, while the line connecting the BMT Broadway Line is the BMT 63rd Street Line.|$|E
5|$|The 63rd Street Line was {{the final}} version of {{proposals}} for a northern midtown tunnel from <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Queens Boulevard Line to the Second and Sixth Avenue lines, which dated back to <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Second System of the 1920s and 1930s. The current plans were drawn up in the 1960s under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Program For Action.|$|E

5|$|The B, D, and Q trains {{were all}} rerouted from the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line to the express tracks of <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Sixth Avenue Line {{as part of}} Manhattan Bridge reconstruction. No more express service was to be run on the Broadway Line, since these {{services}} comprised the entirety of Broadway express service. This also eliminated the divided B and D services (the Sixth Avenue Line B/D services were separate from the Broadway Line B/D services, as the Sixth Avenue services had originated at 34th Street–Herald Square and continued to upper Manhattan and the Bronx via <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Eighth Avenue Line and <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Concourse Line).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>IND</b> Concourse Line got {{funding to}} be {{extended}} eastward past 205th Street, but Bronx residents wanted to rehabilitate the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway right-of way. This funding was reallocated, and the old NYW line became the IRT Dyre Avenue Line in December 1941, and <b>the</b> <b>IND</b> Concourse Line extension was not brought up again until 1968.|$|E
