The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or <b>temporary,</b> <b>admission</b> to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore’s criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> to the state bar.|$|E
5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E

The new law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'établissement), which is known as a C permit. Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with <b>temporary</b> <b>admission</b> (Permis d'admission provisoire) halved for purposes of applying for naturalisation.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} vexing and {{persistent}} questions in U. S. immigration policy involve whether and how to design programs to admit temporary workers. These questions often prompt disagreement, even among those who otherwise agree on many aspects of immigration law and policy. To address these questions, this Article starts with {{a brief overview of}} <b>temporary</b> worker <b>admissions</b> in U. S. immigration law today, and then summarizes the main points typically made by supporters and skeptics. It next identifies key questions for those who would design temporary worker programs. The main part of the Article then explains how analysis of temporary worker programs generally reflects some combination of four broad perspectives. One perspective evaluates temporary worker programs as a force in the U. S. economy that benefits many citizens and permanent residents but disadvantages others. A second perspective views <b>admission</b> of <b>temporary</b> workers not only in comparison to its traditional foil — admission of permanent residents — but also to immigration outside the law. A third perspective analyzes <b>temporary</b> worker <b>admissions</b> not only as a vital facet of immigration law, but also as essential to international economic development. A fourth perspective assesses <b>temporary</b> <b>admissions</b> in the context not just of immigration law, but also of citizenship, especially by looking at the integration of future generations. Comparing and evaluating these four perspectives can shed light on current debates by broadening and deepening analysis of temporary worker programs. Overall, the broad assessment provided by a balanced combination of these perspectives generally suggests cautious support for temporary worker programs, but only if they are carefully designed and coordinated with initiatives outside of immigration law. ...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] There is {{a broad-based}} {{consensus}} that the U. S. immigration system is broken. This consensus erodes, however, {{as soon as the}} options to reform the U. S. immigration system are debated. The number of foreign-born people residing in the United States is at the highest level in U. S. history and has reached a proportion of the U. S. population— 12. 6 %—not seen since the early 20 th century. Of the 38 million foreign-born residents in the United States, approximately one-third are naturalized citizens, one-third are legal permanent residents, and one-third are estimated to be unauthorized (illegal) residents. Some observers and policy experts maintain that the presence of an estimated 11 million unauthorized residents is evidence of flaws in the legal immigration system as well as failures of immigration control policies and practices. The 111 th Congress is faced with strategic questions of whether to continue to build on incremental reforms of specific elements of immigration (e. g., employment verification, skilled migration, temporary workers, worksite enforcement, and legalization of certain categories of unauthorized residents) or whether to comprehensively reform the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). President Barack Obama has affirmed his support for comprehensive immigration reform legislation that includes increased enforcement as well as a pathway to legal residence for certain unauthorized residents. This report synthesizes the multi-tiered debate over immigration reform into key elements: legal immigration; legalization; immigration control; refugees, asylees, and humanitarian migrants; and, alien rights, benefits and responsibilities.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the international refugee regime as it has evolved over the last quarter century is the proliferation of labels. Rather than simply assessing the circumstances of applicants against the Convention refugee definition, the governments of most developed states have instead invented a seemingly endless list of alternative statuses - 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 status, humanitarian <b>admission,</b> <b>temporary</b> protected status, special leave to remain, Duldung, and the like. Persons assigned one of these labels have generally been protected against refoulement in line with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention. But in a variety of other ways, they have not been treated as refugees. They have, in particular, faced limits on freedom of movement, the ability to earn a livelihood, and access to education and general social support systems. Most critically, there has been a near-universal association of alter-native status with non-permanent presence. While refugees are by and large granted 2 ̆ 2 asylum 2 ̆ 2 - understood to entail an enduring right to remain in, or to be enfranchised by, the host country - the beneficiaries of alternative forms of protection have usually been admitted instead to what is commonly called 2 ̆ 2 temporary 2 ̆ 2 protection.

40|$|Excerpt] There is {{a broad-based}} {{consensus}} that the U. S. immigration system is broken. This consensus erodes, however, {{as soon as the}} options to reform the U. S. immigration system are debated. Substantial efforts to comprehensively reform immigration law failed in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses. Whether the 112 th Congress will address immigration reform in the midst of historically high levels of unemployment and budgetary constrictions is difficult to project. The number of foreign-born people residing in the United States is at the highest level in U. S. history and has reached a proportion of the U. S. population— 12. 5 %—not seen since the early 20 th century. Of the 38 million foreign-born residents in the United States, approximately 16. 4 million are naturalized citizens. The remaining 21. 6 million foreign-born residents are noncitizens. According to the latest estimates by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), about 10. 8 million unauthorized aliens were living in the United States in January 2010, down from a peak of 11. 8 million in January 2007. Some observers and policy experts maintain that the presence of millions of unauthorized residents is evidence of inadequacies in the legal immigration system as well as failures of immigration control policies and practices. This report synthesizes immigration issues as a multi-tiered debate. It breaks down the U. S. immigration law and policy into key elements: border control and visa security; legal immigration; documentation and verification; interior immigration enforcement; integration, status, and benefits; and refugees and other humanitarian populations. It delineates the debate in the 112 th Congress for a range of issues, including border security, criminal aliens, worksite enforcement, employment eligibility verification, permanent <b>admissions,</b> <b>temporary</b> workers, legalization, noncitizen eligibility for federal benefits, birthright citizenship, and the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws. Current circumstances may sharpen the social and business cleavages as well as narrow the range of options.
