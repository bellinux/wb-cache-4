5|$|During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms {{were built}} in Valletta {{to serve as the}} war {{headquarters}} for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Throughout the war, many air-raid shelters also were dug in the limestone rock of the islands, either by the government or by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> still exist, and a few are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The E-boats laid up in <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> {{during the}} day, safe from air–attack, and put to sea {{under cover of}} night to attack Allied shipping. The pens were {{priority}} targets as the torpedo boats they protected were a considerable threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces in western Europe. Since August 1944, the two bunkers had been attacked four times by No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the RAF, {{with a total of}} 53 of the five–ton, Tallboy earthquake bombs. There had been numerous other attacks from bombers carrying smaller, conventional bombs.|$|E

40|$|There were 1 643 dogs {{accepted}} to <b>the</b> dog <b>shelter</b> in Tábor {{in the years}} 20082015, wherein the amount of annualy accepted dogs slightly decreased. Dogs, that were returned to the original owner, spent shorter time (median 1 day) in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> than dogs, that were left alone and found a new home (median 18 days). <b>The</b> <b>shelter</b> accepted more male than female dogs. Simultaneously, male spent in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> longer time than female. Most of the dogs {{accepted to}} <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> were younger than 1 year. The most common colour was black, the majority of dogs had a short and soft hair. Hybrids predominated among accepted dogs, following by German shepherds, Labrador retrievers and Dachshunds (or their hybrids). Dogs with a good character prevailed in <b>the</b> <b>shelter.</b> Data on abandoned dogs were statistically processed. There were found a significant effect of following variables {{on the length of}} stay in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> - age, height, purebred, temperament, colour, length and type of hair, and also the month of entry into <b>the</b> <b>shelter.</b> With increasing age and size (height) of dog there was demonstrably extended length of dogs stay in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> before they were adopted, as well as an aggressive character and dogs accepted in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> in October or November. Interestingly, the visually purebred dogs (corresponding to a certain breed standard) looked for a new home longer time than hybrids, provably. On the other hand, dogs with a light-coloured, soft or short hair and dogs accepted in February or April stayed in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> shorter time. When advertising the abandoned dogs for adoption, it is necessary to focus primarily on dogs that spend in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> longer time on average that means male dogs, large dogs, older dogs, dogs with long, black or rough hair and aggressive or temperamental dogs...|$|R
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the first Swift station, located at Airport Road in south Everett, was held on December 3, 2008, and was attended by Community Transit CEO Joyce Eleanor, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and the mayors of Everett and Marysville. Stations were constructed in two phases: the first consisting of utility relocation and pouring of the concrete shelter pad; the second being the installation of <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> beacons, and other amenities beginning in June 2009. The first station to be completed, a training facility at the Merrill Creek bus base, was opened during a media event on May 5, 2009; in September 2009, the first station on the line was completed at 196th Street in Lynnwood.|$|E
5|$|All {{flights in}} and out of the Cabo San Lucas, La Paz, Los Cabos, and Loreto {{airports}} were cancelled on September15. A terminal roof at the Los Cabos was detached and the ceiling was partially destroyed. As a result, approximately 3,000-4,000people aboard 44flights were stranded. Although the interior walls of the airport in La Paz sustained damage, the airport resumed normal operations within a week following Odile. Throughout the peninsula, 30,000vacationers were stranded, including 26,000 from other nations, mainly from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Many of the stranded were evacuated to shelters, though one of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> collapsed due to overcrowding. By September16, many tourists were airlifted to surrounding airports, including Tijuana, Mazatlán, Guadalajara, and Mexico City, although one person perished on a flight back via a heart attack due to stress the storm created.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's heavy damage, {{homeless}} residents {{resided in}} temporary camps. Later, the Indian government set up 742relief centers housing 177,000people, utilizing schools and office buildings. However, residents did not stay {{for extended periods}} of time in <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> as rebuilding began within three days of the storm's landfall. Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water to those in need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on concrete slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> at Landsborough match exactly the March 1942 plan signed by Da Costa, whereas <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> at Shorncliffe has an overhanging roof slab. <b>The</b> surviving Maryborough <b>shelter</b> (two were built) {{appears to be}} a variant of the standard pillbox, where the doorways are close to the front wall and open directly into the main interior space of <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> (facing towards <b>the</b> centre), rather than facing towards the rear of <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> and leading into the narrower end sections. The Toowoomba railway station's two public shelters (one of which still exists) also used this entrance design.|$|R

5|$|In {{the greater}} St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, area alone, 320,000 people {{evacuated}} {{ahead of the}} storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history. The large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities, highways, and contingencies. Although {{the number of people}} required to leave far exceeded the capacity of Pinellas County shelters, only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> Still, official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average, possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives, or increased awareness of available resources. Post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90% in Pinellas County, and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours, rather than the expected 15. With over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central Florida, evacuees became restless {{as a result of the}} duration of the storm. Supplies such as food ran short, and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely. The threat of Hurricane Elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients. Tampa General Hospital, at 84% of patient capacity, was evacuated; four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in Pinellas County were also cleared. Overall, nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety. Although successful, the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages.|$|E
5|$|Local {{chapters}} of the American Red Cross organized first-aid stations and shelters; transportation was provided {{to those who were}} unable to reach <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> In advance of the storm, Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana, Cuba. The United States Navy also prepared its bases in the Florida Keys for the arrival of the storm by securing boats to piers and canceling all shore leaves, while the United States Army Air Corps moved its planes from Morrison Field to a safer location inland. The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm, establishing depots in West Palm Beach, Miami, and Fort Myers, and the Governor of Florida, Spessard Holland, ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work. A detachment of officers from the Florida Highway Patrol was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm. The state also opened all of the school buildings in Dade County as emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|The IMD issued {{warnings}} {{related to}} the cyclone that were distributed to the public by television, telegraph, news outlets, and other government departments. The All India Radio broadcast warnings beginning on November5, the day before landfall. Train service was disrupted throughout Andhra Pradesh, stranding thousands of travelers. India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation suspended operations during the storm. The storm caused local Diwali festivities to be canceled. It ultimately struck about 50km (30mi) north of where it was expected, in a region farther away from state shelters. About 225,000families evacuated due to the storm. However, about 30% of the towns in the region lacked a storm shelter, and the existing shelters were generally in poor shape. Some residents avoided <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> due to their state of disrepair, or stayed in their homes for fear they would be robbed. In addition, storm emergency plans enacted after a cyclone in 1977 that struck Andhra Pradesh had not been used since 1986. Roads and shelters built following a cyclone in 1990 fared the storm better than older structures.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Strategies that {{increase}} foraging efficiency may also increase predation risk. We investigated how individuals of Hingstepeira folisecens Hingston, 1932, which build <b>shelters</b> at <b>the</b> orb hub, modulate their foraging behaviors {{in response to}} the trade-off between capturing prey and becoming exposed by leaving their shelters. We evaluated whether the position of the prey on the web alters the frequency at which spiders leave their shelters. Hingstepeira folisecens spiders were more likely to capture prey positioned below than above the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>shelter.</b> Moreover, when <b>the</b> prey was near the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>shelter,</b> <b>the</b> spider pulled the threads with the entangled prey without leaving <b>the</b> <b>shelter.</b> Conversely, when <b>the</b> prey was distant from the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>shelter,</b> an "attack" behavior (leaving <b>the</b> <b>shelter)</b> was favored. We argue that the "pulling behavior" may be an adaptation to reduce exposure to predators...|$|R

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that some of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> were {{incomplete}} as war broke out, some had little to no ventilation, many of them not camouflaged and some were not fitted with armored observation domes. The incomplete state of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> significantly reduced the combat capability of the emplacements.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>shelters</b> {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> Floors {{are made from}} tread plate, although newer shelters now use concrete. <b>The</b> <b>shelters</b> are equipped with platform screen doors. Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the tread plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the tread plate surfaces. Another problem {{is that some of the}} tread plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters {{can become}} grounds for {{community}} {{organization and the}} recruitment of homeless individuals into social movements for their own cause. Cooperation between the shelter and an elected representative from the homeless community at each shelter can serve as the backbone of this form of initiative. The representative presents and forwards problems, raises concerns and provides new ideas to the director and staff of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> A few examples of possible problems are {{ways to deal with}} drug and alcohol use by certain shelter users and resolve interpersonal conflicts. SAND, the Danish National Organization for Homeless People, is one example of an organization that uses this empowerment approach. Issues reported at the homeless shelters are then addressed by SAND at the regional or national level. To open further dialogue, SAND organizes regional discussion forums where staff and leaders from <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> homeless representatives, and local authorities meet to discuss issues and good practices at <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b>|$|E

25|$|There are two bridges within park boundaries. A {{footbridge}} {{over the}} Chicago River {{was designed by}} Hatzfeld in 1927 and opened in 1928. The original footbridge featured an arched wooden deck with metal support beams.

When the Chicago Park District significantly rebuilt and altered the bridge in 1942, they kept <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> intact. It is not known when <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> were removed from the site. The park district undertook extensive reconstruction of the bridge again in 1995.

25|$|A {{question}} has been raised as just how much money donated to the charities that run <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> actually gets to the homeless people and the required services.
