500|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} {{evidence}} of textile dyeing {{dating back to the}} Neolithic period. In China, dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. The essential process of dyeing changed little over time. [...] Typically, the dye material is put in a pot of water and then the textiles to be dyed are added to the pot, which is heated and stirred until the color is transferred. [...] <b>Textile</b> <b>fibre</b> may be dyed before spinning ("dyed in the wool"), but most textiles are [...] "yarn-dyed" [...] or [...] "piece-dyed" [...] after weaving. Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called mordants to bind the dye to the textile fibres; tannin from oak galls, salt, natural alum, vinegar, and ammonia from stale urine were used by early dyers. [...] Many mordants, and some dyes themselves, produce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own districts.|$|E

40|$|In the past, the {{presence}} of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> in the bullet track of gunshot injuries in body regions covered with clothes was used to differentiate between entrance and exit wounds; as with handguns, a displacement of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> was considered possible only {{in the direction of}} the shot. In the present study, the transfer of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> from the entrance and exit regions into the bullet path was systematically investigated with the help of a skin-gelatine composite model. For this purpose, the skin of the bullet entrance and exit region was covered with textile fabric (jeans or jersey material), before conducting four test series of ten test shots each firing a 9 -mm Parabellum full-jacketed projectile from a distance of 2 m. The length of the bullet track was 25 and 8 cm, respectively. Subsequently, the bullet tracks were microscopically investigated in sections for {{the presence}} of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> In all the investigated bullet tracks, <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> both from the entrance and exit regions could be demonstrated. The distribution pattern depended on the length of the bullet path and the extension of the temporary cavitation. The results are discussed in relation to the relevant literature...|$|R

40|$|Sorption {{capacity}} of <b>textiles</b> <b>fibres</b> for surfactants and water is discussed. Adsorption of surfactants is characterized through adsorption isotherms, adsorbed, desorbed and residual amount of ionic surfactants in variation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic part and concentration as well. Water sorption is expressed as moisture content and water retention value of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> Cationic and anionic surfactants are adsorbed on the cotton, wool, polyester and polypropylene fibres at 20 C for 60 minutes. Desorption of surfactants is performed at 20 C for 30 minutes.

50|$|Vat dyes are {{essentially}} {{insoluble in water}} and incapable of dyeing fibres directly. However, reduction in alkaline liquor produces the water-soluble alkali metal salt of the dye, which, in this leuco form, has an affinity for the <b>textile</b> <b>fibre.</b> Subsequent oxidation reforms the original insoluble dye. The color of denim is due to indigo, the original vat dye.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War, {{the south}} {{bank of the}} Humber estuary was industrially developed; in the parish of Healing a Courtaulds <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> plant was established.

50|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, the hunt was on for new {{synthetic}} fibres to rival Wallace H. Carothers' nylon. Whinfield {{and his assistant}} James Tennant Dickson investigated other types of polymers with <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> potential. Whinfield and Dickson discovered how to condense terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol to yield a new polymer which could be drawn into a fibre. Whinfield and Dickson patented their invention in July 1941, but due to wartime secrecy restrictions it was not made public until 1946. ICI (Terylene) and DuPont (Dacron) went on to produce their own versions of the fibre.|$|E

50|$|Emil Witzenmann, son of Heinrich Witzenmann, {{developed}} {{a form of}} the metal hose in 1909 that eliminated the need {{for any kind of}} sealing thread, be it of rubber, <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> or asbestos. In this type of hose, the strip edges do not interlock but abut each other and are seamlessly welded together. In 1920, Emil Witzenmann invented the metal expansion joint. This invention was based on the double-walled, welded, corrugated metal hose (with a wound protection sheath) with radial flexibility. In 1929, it became possible {{for the first time to}} produce metal bellows. These were also developed by Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, but independently of Witzenmann.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{situation in the}} 1930s meant that Leene could not continue her zoology career and {{to make ends meet}} she became a high school biology teacher, teaching at a number of schools in different towns in order to gate an income she could survive on. This left little time for her to continue her studies in carcinology. On 15 October 1939 she was appointed as a teacher of biology at a girls' school for technical education in Arnhem, while having another job teaching in Haarlem. When a teacher specialising in <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> research left Leene was asked to take that subject on too. She became interested and proficient in this subject ad in 1945 she was appointed as a curator in the Division of Fibre Technology in the Department of Mechanical Technology of Technische Hogeschool Delft (Delft Institute of Technology).|$|E
50|$|In 1929 Berkhoff {{started his}} career as a {{research}} chemist at DSM (Dutch State Mines). During the nineteen thirties, he supervised the development of fertilizers for the Nitrogen Fixation Plant (Stikstofbindings Bedrijf (SBB)). His publications on the crystallisation of ammonium nitrate date from this period. His visionary and social talents led to the changing from incremental research (responding to the competition) to innovative research (taking the initiative). This resulted in 1940 in the foundation of the Central Laboratory (Centraal Laboratorium (CL)), of which he became Director. His journeys to the USA, immediately after WW2, meant to look at diversification options, enabled DSM to start the production of caprolactam, the raw material needed for the enkalon or nylon 6 <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> of the AKU, now part of AkzoNobel. Until his departure in 1961, he was CEO of all DSM's Research and Development Divisions, which under his supervision became highly successful.|$|E

40|$|This paper gives a review, {{based on}} the fibre prospective, {{on the effect of}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation on the <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> Both natural and synthetic fibres, including cotton, wool, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and nylon, are the common types of <b>fibre</b> found in <b>textile</b> and apparel. Those <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> can help protect human from the harmful effect caused by UV radiation. However, under the influence of UV radiation, those fibres is subjected to various degrees of damage and degradation.

The substitution of fresh by used foundry sand and the insertions of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> contribute to a less brittle behaviour of polymer mortar...|$|R
