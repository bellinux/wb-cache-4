5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> of the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.|$|E

He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the bicentennial}} celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin {{depicting}} the Lion monument over {{a map of the}} field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus {{was first}} {{described}} under its current binomial name by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 work Ornithologia Britannica. The scientific name Falco peregrinus is a Medieval Latin phrase {{that was used}} by Albertus Magnus in 1225. The specific name taken {{from the fact that}} juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location rather than from the nest, as falcon nests were difficult to get at. The Latin term for falcon, falco, is related to falx, the Latin word meaning sickle, in reference to <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|Arhys informs Daryus that Gabriel {{will be at}} Heaven's Cove {{that night}} ("Moment of Betrayal"). While the meeting time {{approaches}} ("Heaven's Cove"), Faythe decides {{that she wants to}} use the power of her royal status to change the world for good ("Begin Again"). At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> of someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E
5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> of a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in <b>the</b> <b>silhouette</b> (in profile) of the elder, be {{explained}} … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this paper}} two methods for 3 D shape indexing and retrieval that we apply on two data collections of the SHREC - SHape Retrieval Contest 2007 : Watertight models and 3 D CAD models. Both methods {{are based on a}} set of 2 D multi-views after a pose and scale normalization of the models using PCA and the enclosing sphere. In all views we extract <b>the</b> models <b>silhouettes</b> and compare them pairwise. In the first method the similitude measure is obtained by integrating on the pairs of views the difference between the areas of <b>the</b> <b>silhouettes</b> union and <b>the</b> <b>silhouettes</b> intersection. In <b>the</b> second method we consider the external contour of <b>the</b> <b>silhouettes,</b> extract their convexities and concavities at different scale levels and build a multiscale representation. The pairs of contours are then compared by elastic matching achieved by using dynamic programming. Comparisons of the two methods are shown with their respective strengths and weaknesses...|$|R
