He met with Gunn at Anacostia on 14 January 1943, and explained the situation to him. Gunn responded that the navy was interested in nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines. Liquid thermal diffusion was a viable means of producing enriched uranium, and all he needed was details about nuclear reactor design, which he knew was being pursued by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. He was unaware that <b>the</b> <b>it</b> had already built Chicago Pile-1, a working nuclear reactor. Bush was unwilling to provide the requested data, but arranged with Rear Admiral William R.

Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations.

40|$|A {{common problem}} in <b>IT</b> {{management}} involves <b>the</b> lack of business vision on <b>the</b> part of <b>IT</b> executives who align <b>IT</b> to <b>the</b> strategic {{assumptions of the}} company, but forget the tactical functions of the former, managed as a business. This {{is known as the}} Lutchen’s gap. Because of its importance in <b>the</b> context of <b>IT</b> management, this paper is a complementary approach to the preceding one from Rodrigues et al. (2009) and aims at identifying the Lutchen´s gap presence in <b>the</b> management of <b>IT</b> among <b>the</b> 100 top companies located in Brazil. To do this, we proceeded to a description of <b>the</b> profile of <b>IT</b> management in these companies, controlled by the executive board. We used a questionnaire filled out by IT executives, containing 77 questions covering the four functions of IT in a company. The main results indicate that: (a) In <b>the</b> <b>IT’s</b> Alignment function, <b>the</b> design of <b>IT</b> reveals dichotomies between business and IT objectives (b) In <b>the</b> <b>IT’s</b> Management function, <b>the</b> <b>IT’s</b> budget is oriented toward ensuring "delivering" abilities to IT services and differing in the methods of cost control, ranging from apportion by volume, overheads and by ABC cost, (c) in <b>the</b> <b>IT’s</b> Deliver function, evidence suggests that IT is managed as a business enabler; and (d) in <b>the</b> <b>IT’s</b> Quality and Safety Assurance, IT executives monitor quality and safety events, but are limited to IT’s basic operations. In conclusion, in <b>the</b> companies surveyed, <b>IT</b> is seen much more as an" on-demand solution provider", rather than as an instrument of innovation and competitiveness enabler for organizations...|$|R
