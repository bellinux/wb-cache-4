But, Nias people and their activity were noted well by Fantsur (Barus) and Sibolga people (Both are Bataknese) during their trade. Nias island was officially part of Fantsur (Barus) empire in the tenth century (it might be has already been earlier). Their relationship was still good until the 17th century.

50|$|There is an {{increasing}} body of empirical evidence {{about the impact of}} trade facilitation on export competitiveness and growth. Studies reviewed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2002) indicate that <b>trade</b> <b>transaction</b> costs amount to up to 15 percent of the value of traded goods globally. A subsequent OECD study (2003) found trade transactions costs to be higher on agricultural and food products, fish, and forest and wood products (since these products are subject to additional border procedures due to sanitary and phytosanitary requirements). These are products for which many developing countries have an advantage. The same study also reported that small and medium enterprises suffer most from poor trade-related practices and poorer developing countries have a larger share of such enterprises. A number of other studies have illustrated the specifics of why trade facilitation matters and specific sources of trade costs. One study, for example, found that barriers to export performance in Africa are closely related to firm characteristics and policies that raise trade costs. This includes non-transparent customs laws and administration. Much less evidence was found that transport infrastructure, in comparison, {{had a significant impact on}} export performance (Clarke, 2005).|$|E
50|$|Before the 2010-11 season began, {{there was}} much {{anticipation}} around the league over the fates of an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Raptors franchise player Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. Bosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign and <b>trade</b> <b>transaction</b> that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami. Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, also a left-handed power forward like Bosh, acquired Solomon Alabi from the Dallas Mavericks, and picked up Joey Dorsey. Amir Johnson was signed to a new deal, and Linas Kleiza was made an offer sheet that Denver later refused to match. After Bosh left, General Manager Bryan Colangelo sought to trade Reggie Evans, José Calderón—the last remaining Raptor from the pre-Colangelo days—and the disenchanted Hedo Türkoğlu for Tyson Chandler, Boris Diaw, Leandro Barbosa and Dwayne Jones. Barbosa was drafted by Colangelo when the latter was still with the Phoenix Suns, and Diaw played there during Colangelo's tenure too. However, the trade involving Chandler/Diaw/Evans/Calderón fell apart {{at the last minute}} when Chandler was traded to Dallas instead. A sign-and-trade involving Orlando's Matt Barnes was also in the works, but ran into last-minute difficulties as well. In the coaching department, P. J.

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 220 - 238. Chapter One. Introduction : {{emissions}} trading schemes {{and the problem}} of taxation [...] Chapter Two. Accounting for carbon emission allowances [...] Chapter Three. Domestic taxation of emissions <b>trading</b> <b>transactions</b> [...] Chapter Four. International taxation of emissions <b>trading</b> <b>transactions</b> [...] Chapter Five. Conclusions. The economic arguments in support of the use of {{emissions trading}} schemes as a mechanism to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions rely on the ability of the schemes to internalise the cost of the pollution externality through a price signal – the cost of an emission permit. Taxation has the potential to distort this price signal if emissions <b>trading</b> <b>transactions</b> are not subject to the same tax treatment across entities but, to date, the issue of the application of taxation regimes to such transactions has received little academic consideration. The prospect of inconsistent tax treatment is heightened where emissions trading systems are linked internationally, allowing permits to flow between jurisdictions. This thesis systematically examines the direct (income) taxation of carbon <b>trading</b> <b>transactions</b> in order to determine instances in practice where inconsistent tax outcomes may arise and makes recommendations for tax law design. The thesis builds up a picture of emissions trading taxation through three layers. The first is the treatment of relevant transactions for financial accounting purposes. This is necessary given that many jurisdictions take accounting profits as the starting point in determining tax liability. The second element is domestic taxation and involves a detailed, comparative analysis of the domestic tax treatment of emissions <b>trading</b> <b>transactions</b> in Australia and the United Kingdom. These jurisdictions are amenable to comparison given that the United Kingdom is representative of jurisdictions that apply ordinary tax rules to these transactions, whereas Australia has adopted specifically designed tax rules to address the unusual features of the transactions. The third element is international taxation, where this necessarily involves the application of both international tax rules found in domestic law and tax treaties. These rules are applied to six hypothetical <b>trading</b> <b>transactions</b> which could arise under linked trading schemes in order to systematically test the outcomes against the goal of inter-firm neutrality. For these purposes, the representative tax systems are again based on the Australia and United Kingdom models and the tax treaty network is assumed {{to be based on the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital.
