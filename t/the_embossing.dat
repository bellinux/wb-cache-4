30|$|From the {{numerical}} analysis, when <b>the</b> <b>embossed</b> part was cooled, it shrank {{from the edge}} toward the thermal center of <b>the</b> <b>embossed</b> part but <b>the</b> sidewall of a mold cavity contacting the post prevented its shrinkage. This caused thermal stress and stress concentration in the post. As {{the distance between the}} posts and thermal center increased, thermal stresses also increased since they were proportional to the amount of shrinkage of <b>the</b> <b>embossed</b> part.|$|R

2500|$|The coins were {{originally}} planned {{in great numbers}} of 100 million and 250 million, Rpf 5 and 10 Rpf respectively. The first embossing order, which was issued in April 1940, was about 40 million 5 Rpf and 100 million 10 Rpf. The total amount was divided between {{each of the seven}} German mints after <b>the</b> <b>embossing</b> key of 1939. The contract was stopped in August 1940 as the Wehrmacht, which had requested the coins for Belgium and France, had no more need of it. [...] When <b>the</b> <b>embossing</b> stopped, only Berlin ("A") and Munich ("D") produced significant quantities, but they still came to only a small extent of original production plans. The majority were melted down due to the limited supply of metal and thus, most mint marks are now quite rare (except for 1940 5 A and D, and 1940 10 A).|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{tensile test}} of <b>the</b> <b>embossed</b> sheet was {{conducted}} and the tensile deformation behavior is experimentally investigated.

5000|$|Embossing is {{basically}} {{used to create}} a distinctive effect. The greatest concern and emphasis on the client's behalf should be placed on the outcome of the embossed effect.

Several models are created varying the number, position, and pitch of <b>the</b> <b>emboss</b> or restoration points. <b>The</b> <b>emboss</b> height and sheet thickness are also varied. Results show that improvement in rigidity of sheet metals can be optimized by taking into considerations several parameters as discussed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|Embossing is {{the process}} of {{creating}} raised relief within one's design. Embossing is used to create both concave and convex shapes by alternating the side on which <b>the</b> <b>embossing</b> is performed. Using <b>the</b> <b>embossing</b> tools and appropriate embossing pad, the parchment is rubbed backwards and forwards or side to side in parallel movements with increasing downward pressure so that the parchment can be evenly stretched. A finished embossment will be satin-white in color and will contrast with the translucency of the parchment paper. Color can be varied by moderating the level to which the shape is embossed. Fine lines and hatching can be obtained by embossing with the stylus tool.|$|E

The primary die used for <b>the</b> <b>embossed</b> issue was engraved by Wyon; the 1s and 10d stamps have the initials [...] "ww" [...] along with the die number {{at the base of the}} neck. His design also influenced the surface-printed stamps first printed in 1855.|$|R

50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>embossing</b> {{process the}} rollers have {{engraved}} patterns on them, and the patterns become stamped onto the fabric. The {{end result is}} a raised or sunken pattern, depending on the roller. This works best with soft fabrics.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of foil in the United States was in 1913 for {{wrapping}} Life Savers, candy bars, and gum. Processes evolved over time to {{include the use of}} print, colour, lacquer, laminate and <b>the</b> <b>embossing</b> of the aluminium.|$|E
50|$|Matraire did {{not have}} {{facilities}} for recess printing, so his first stamps were produced by lithography, later (1855) switching to letterpress.
