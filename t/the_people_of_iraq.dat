2500|$|In December 2002 Kenneth O'Keefe, an ex-U.S. Marine and Gulf War {{veteran who}} had {{attempted}} multiple times to renounce his U.S. citizenship, posted {{a call to}} action for large numbers of western citizens to migrate to Iraq and deploy themselves as [...] "Human Shields". The action was ultimately named the TJP (Truth Justice Peace) Human Shield Action to Iraq. O'Keefe believed that protests and petitions had no chance of preventing the invasion and that a large presence of western citizens, strategically placed in Iraq at potential targets, was the only viable deterrent to war. He argued that thousands of human shields deployed to these sites would make the invasion politically untenable. O'Keefe publicly acknowledged Saddam Hussein as a [...] "violent dictator" [...] and [...] "mass-murderer" [...] before he arrived in Iraq; it has been speculated he did this in an attempt to neutralize the perception that the human shields were simply pawns of Saddam. [...] Consequently, he received no favor from Saddam, his influence within the action declined rapidly as he traveled to Iraq, and eventually he was deported days before the invasion. Before his deportation he repeatedly alleged U.S. and British support for Hussein during some of his worst crimes; ultimately he argued that it was <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> who would suffer most from war.|$|E

Their relationship seems unambiguously {{to be one of}} mutual admiration and respect. In her writing, Bell describes Cox as possessing an [...] "air of fine and simple dignity," [...] praising his [...] "kindness and consideration," [...] and claiming that his disposition towards her amounted to [...] "an absurd indulgence." [...] Bell describes Cox's political and diplomatic prowess, calling him [...] "a master hand at the game of politics." [...] She notes the respect that he enjoyed with <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and when writing about Cox's dealings with Ibn Saud even declares, [...] "It's really amazing that anyone should exercise influence such as his&hellip;I don't think that any European in history has made a deeper impression on the Oriental mind." [...] Cox, for his part, returns the high regard, referring to Bell's [...] "indefatigable assistance". He continued…to the greater degree to which Gertrude enjoyed my confidence and I her devoted co-operation, a co-operation which I know from my successor she rendered with the same singleness of purpose for him - Sir Henry Dobbs that is.|$|R
