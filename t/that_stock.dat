We study {{the costs of}} short selling equities, 1926 - 1933, using the publicly observable market for borrowing stock.

We find <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> are expensive to short or which enter the borrowing market have high valuations and low subsequent returns, consistent with the overpricing hypothesis.

40|$|China {{launched}} a pilot scheme in March 2010 {{to lift the}} bans on short-selling and margin-trading for stocks on a designated list. We find <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> experience negative returns when added to the list. After the bans are lifted, the return volatility increases, and pricing efficiency decreases in the up-market. Utilizing panel data on the daily short-selling and margin-trading volume, we surprisingly find <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> are heavily sold short earn higher future returns, whereas <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> are heavily purchased on margin subsequently underperform. Chinese investors appear to trade strongly based on the technical analysis. We thus conclude that neither short-sellers nor margin-traders possess superior information or skill. We argue that short-sellers speculate in periods of high volatility following a wider divergence of opinion, whereas margin-traders speculate in periods of low volatility, which adds to return volatility and destabilize the market. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) {{reported}} that growth for stock and commodities traders was forecast {{to be greater}} than 21% between 2006 and 2016. In that period, stock traders would benefit from trends driven by pensions of baby boomers and their decreased reliance on Social Security. U.S. Treasury bonds would also be traded on a more fluctuating basis. Stock traders just entering the field suffer since few entry-level positions exist. While entry into this career field is very competitive, increased ownership of stocks and mutual funds drive substantial career growth of traders. Banks were also offering more opportunities for people of average means to invest and speculate in stocks. The BLS reported <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> traders had median annual incomes of $68,500. Experienced traders of stocks and mutual funds {{have the potential to}} earn more than $145,600 annually.|$|E
25|$|In 1795, Daniel Carroll, William Duncanson, Thomas Law, Notley Young, George Walker, and Matthew Wigfield {{petitioned the}} Maryland General Assembly for {{permission}} to construct a bascule bridge over the Anacostia River. On December 24, 1795, the Maryland legislature adopted a bill authorizing the bridge. The Maryland act required that the bridge be constructed {{at the base of}} Kentucky Avenue SE (less than a hundred feet downstream from the terminus of the current bridge). (William Young, Elizabeth Wheeler's brother and a relative of Notley Young's, owned this land.) Its southeastern terminus was to be on land owned by Wigfield. It was authorized by law to collect tolls, although these could be no higher than the market average. A corporation, the Eastern Branch Bridge Co., was formed to build the bridge. It issued 225 shares at $200 a share, with dividends to be paid from tolls collected on the bridge. Under the terms of the legislature's bill, title to the bridge reverted to the state of Maryland after 30 years. The corporation didn't act with much urgency. It was not until March 18, 1801, <b>that</b> <b>stock</b> in the firm was sold, but even then $43,000 was quickly raised.|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{a source of}} {{commonality}} in a stock’s liquidity arises from correlated trading among the stock’s investors.

40|$|We {{examine the}} pricing of {{aggregate}} volatility {{risk in the}} cross-section of stock returns. Consistent with theory, we find <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> with high sensitivities to innovations in aggregate volatility have low average returns. In addition, we find <b>that</b> <b>stocks</b> with high idiosyncratic volatility relative to the Fama and French (1993) model have abysmally low average returns. This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to aggregate volatility risk. Size, book-to-market, momentum, and liquidity effects cannot account for either the low average returns earned by stocks with high exposure to systematic volatility risk or for the low average returns of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility. ...|$|R

25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, {{with a standard deviation of}} 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide <b>that</b> <b>Stock</b> A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E
