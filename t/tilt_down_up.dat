25|$|Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) {{are both}} used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is {{characterized}} by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward {{the end of the}} sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and there is a pause and often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts <b>tilted</b> <b>down</b> and jerks <b>up</b> and <b>down,</b> the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this project}} is to provide the basic needs for {{physically}} challenged persons like food, water and medicine and to control the electrical devices like Fan, bulb by using switch buttons and also for controlling wheel chair by using MEMS technology. MEMS are a micro electro mechanical sensor which is a highly sensitive sensor capable of detecting the tilt. This device is portable and this system operation is entirely driven by wireless technology. User can wear the MEMS to his finger and can operate it by <b>tilting</b> <b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> left and right side respectively. This system is also makes use of Microcontroller like LPC 2148. This project also makes use of switches which are operated by physically challenged persons to control the electrical appliances like fan, bulb and some other devices Using AT 89 S 52 Micro Controller and wireless technology like Zigbee. Here one zigbee is placed on Wheel chair and another Zigbee with AT 89 S 52 microcontroller is connected to all electrical appliances. These switches {{can also be used}} to control APR 9600 for audio announcement which is programmed with the help of embedded c instructions...|$|R

40|$|Tilting {{is known}} to cause changes in {{hemodynamics}} due to hydrostatic pressure. The present study is an analysis of changes in cerebral hemodynamics measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) following <b>tilting</b> <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> in preterm and term infants. A significantly different effect of tilting up in comparison to <b>tilting</b> <b>down</b> on total hemoglobin in preterm infants and on the 'hemoglobin oxygenation index' in preterm and term infants was observed. In preterm infants, <b>tilting</b> <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> had a significantly different effect on cerebral blood volume (CBV), with an increase after <b>tilting</b> <b>down</b> and a decrease after tilting up. In term infants, tilting had no significant effect on CBV comparing these two procedures. We think that MRS provides a good method to measure cerebral hemodynamics following tilting, whereby different reactions in infants of different postconceptional age can be observed.

40|$|DistÃrbios {{cardiovascular}}es como a insuficiÃncia cardÃaca e sÃndrome coronariana aguda ocasionam com frequÃncia desordens gastrintestinais, sugerindo a interveniÃncia do sistema cardiovascular no trato gastrintestinal (TGI). VariaÃÃes agudas da volemia alteram o comportamento motor do TGI, contudo, as intervenÃÃes utilizadas para investigar tal fenÃmeno, envolvem manobras invasivas. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste na avaliaÃÃo das variaÃÃes posturais passivas advindas do teste de inclinaÃÃo como ferramenta nÃo-invasiva para promover a redistribuiÃÃo espontÃnea da volemia e analisar os ajustes fisiolÃgicos advindos desta modificaÃÃo hemodinÃmica. Para tal, ratos foram anestesiados, dotando-os de cateteres e realizaÃÃo de gastrostomia para obtenÃÃo da monitoraÃÃo hemodinÃmica e anÃlise da motilidade gastrintestinal. No oitavo dia apÃs as cirurgias, os ratos foram submetidos por 75 min Ã monitoraÃÃo contÃnua da PressÃo Arterial MÃdia (PAM, mmHg), FrequÃncia CardÃaca (FC, b. p. m.), PressÃo Venosa Central (PVC, mmHg) e DÃbito CardÃaco (DC, mL/min). ApÃs os 30 min iniciais de monitoraÃÃo (perÃodo basal), os ratos foram alimentados com a refeiÃÃo teste (vermelho de fenol 0, 75 mg/ml e glicose 5 %), via sonda gÃstrica. Em seguida, foram submetidos Ã sÃbita mudanÃa postural: Grupo aclive (tilt up + 75 Â) ou Grupo declive (<b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> - 75 o), ou mantidos sob posiÃÃo horizontal (Grupo controle). Decorridos 10, 20 ou 30 min, os animais foram eutanasiados para avaliaÃÃo da recuperaÃÃo fracional do corante no estÃmago. Em seguida foi avaliado o trÃnsito intestinal por infusÃo de refeiÃÃo teste via sonda gÃstrica diretamente no intestino delgado 10 min pÃs prandial. Via manometria foi realizada a avaliaÃÃo das contraÃÃes gÃstricas por meio de um balÃo inserido no estÃmago, para determinaÃÃo da frequÃncia e amplitude das contraÃÃes gÃstricas, e o Ãndice de motilidade. O aclive (tilt up + 75 Â) aumentou (P< 0, 05) a PAM, FC e o DC. A PVC apresentou uma resposta bifÃsica (P< 0, 05). No contexto do comportamento motor gastrintestinal, o aclive por sua vez acelerou (P< 0, 05) o esvaziamento gÃstrico de lÃquido e deslocou a linha de base da manometria, sugerindo o aumento no tÃnus gÃstrico. JÃ o sÃbito declive (<b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> - 75 Â), aumentou (P< 0, 05) a PVC e o DC, bem como a FC e PAM. No TGI, o declive aumentou a (P< 0, 05) a retenÃÃo gÃstrica, enquanto reduziu a amplitude das contraÃÃes gÃstricas. Tanto o aclive quanto o declive nÃo modificaram o trÃnsito intestinal de lÃquido. Desta forma, mudanÃas posturais passivas, seja mediante o sÃbito aclive (tilt up + 75 Â) ou declive (<b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> - 75 Â), alÃm de ocasionar reajustes hemodinÃmicos modificam o comportamento motor do TGI em ratos acordados. Cardiovascular disorders such {{as heart}} failure and acute coronary syndrome cause gastrointestinal disorders with frequency, suggesting the intervention of cardiovascular physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Acute variations in blood volume change motor behavior of GIT, however, interventions used to investigate this phenomenon involve invasive procedures. Thus, postural changes resulting from passive tilt testing emerge as a noninvasive tool to promote spontaneous redistribution of blood volume and {{the analysis of the}} physiological role of this phenomenon. For such rats were anesthetized, endowing them with catheters and performing gastrostomy for obtaining hemodynamic monitoring and analysis of gastrointestinal motility. On the eighth day after surgery, the rats was submitted for 75 min to continuous monitoring of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP, mmHg), Heart Rate (HR, b. p. m.), Central Venous Pressure (CVP, mmHg) and Cardiac Output (CO, mL / min). After the initial 30 minutes monitoring (baseline period), the rats were fed the test meal (phenol red 0. 75 mg / ml and 5 % glucose) via gastric tube. Then underwent sudden postural change: Group tilt up (+ 75 Â) or <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> group (- 75 Â), or kept in a horizontal position (control group). After 10, 20 or 30 min, animals were euthanized for evaluation of the fractional recovery of the dye in the stomach. Then we evaluated the intestinal transit by infusion of test meal via gastric tube directly into the small intestine 10 min postprandial. Manometry were performed via the evaluation of gastric contractions by a balloon inserted into the stomach to determine the frequency and amplitude of gastric contractions and motility index. The tilt up (+ 75 Â) increased (P < 0. 05) the MAP, HR and the CO. CVP showed a biphasic response (P< 0. 05). In the context of gastrointestinal motor behavior, the tilt-up accelerated (P< 0. 05) the gastric emptying of liquid and shifted baseline manometry, suggesting an increase in gastric tone. Have a sudden <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> (- 75 Â) increased (P< 0. 05) the PVC and CO, as well as the HR and MAP. GIT in the <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> increased (P< 0. 05) gastric retention, while reducing the amplitude of gastric contractions. Both <b>tilt</b> <b>up</b> and <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> not modify the intestinal transit liquid. Thus, passive position changes, either by sudden tilt up (+ 75 Â) or <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> (- 75 Â), and increases to cause hemodynamic changes the motor behavior of the gut in awake rats...|$|R

50|$|A {{recent study}} by Gottschall and Nichols studied the hindlimb of a decerebrate cat during walking (a CPG {{controlled}} function) in response to changes in head pitch. This study describes the differences in gait and body position of cats walking uphill, downhill and on level surfaces. Proprioceptive (Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles) and exteroreceptive (optic, vestibular and cutaneous) receptors work alone or in combination to adjust the CPG to sensory feedback. The study explored the effects of neck proprioceptors (giving information about the relative location {{of the head and}} body) and vestibular receptors (giving information about the orientation of the head relative to gravity). Decerebrate cats were made to walk on a level surface with their heads level, <b>tilted</b> <b>up</b> or <b>tilted</b> <b>down.</b> Comparing the decerebrate cats to normal cats showed similar EMG patterns during level walking and EMG patterns that reflected downhill walking with the head titled up and uphill walking with the head <b>tilted</b> <b>down.</b> This study proved that neck proprioceptors and vestibular receptors contribute sensory feedback that alters the gait of the animal. This information may be useful for treatment of gait disorders.|$|R
