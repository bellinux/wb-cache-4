5|$|Based on {{apparent}} {{changes in}} the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972, Peter van de Kamp proposed that an unseen companion with an orbital period of 25years was causing gravitational perturbations in its position. This claim was refuted in 1993 by Wulff-Dieter Heintz and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> plates.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the Kertész {{couple were}} {{designated}} as enemy aliens because of World War II (Hungary was {{fighting on the}} side of the Axis powers). Kertész was not permitted to photograph outdoors or to have any project related to national security. Trying to avoid trouble because Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (Cosmia Laboratories), Kertész ceased to do commissioned work and essentially disappeared from <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> world for three years.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and the speed of <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} neutralise the Würzburg system by developing countermeasures against it, Jones {{and his team}} needed to study one of the systems, {{or at least the}} more vital pieces of technology of which the system was composed.

5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out of <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the period}} from 1892 to 1930 various {{photographic}} unions of individual photographic clubs were formed, {{the first of which}} was <b>the</b> Yorkshire <b>Photographic</b> Union formed in 1899 as a regional grouping of photographic clubs and societies. This was followed by <b>the</b> Northern Counties <b>Photographic</b> Federation in 1901, <b>the</b> Scottish <b>Photographic</b> Federation in 1903, the Lancashire and Cheshire Photographic Union in 1905, <b>the</b> Midland Counties <b>Photographic</b> Federation in 1907, and the East Anglian Federation in 1910.|$|R
50|$|Photographers {{were slow}} in coming {{together}} and forming clubs and societies. The first was an informal grouping the Edinburgh Calotype Club around 1843 and <b>the</b> first <b>photographic</b> society, <b>the</b> Leeds <b>Photographic</b> Society in 1852 and {{claims to be}} <b>the</b> oldest <b>photographic</b> society in <b>the</b> world, although it had a break between 1878 and 1881 when it ceased to exist independently. In other countries the Société française de photographie was founded in Paris in 1854.|$|R
5|$|The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was {{originally}} built in 1939 by Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio and was housed at the Taylor Road facility. It is currently housed at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, {{which is much more}} sensitive than <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> plates. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{acquired}} a single Mirage for testing, as a preface to production under license of 100Dassault Mirage IIIS interceptors, with strengthened wings, airframe, and undercarriage. Avionics would differ as well, with the Thomson-CSF Cyrano II radar {{replaced by the}} Hughes Electronics TARAN-18system, to provide the Mirage IIIS compatibility with the AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile. The Mirage IIIS {{was intended to be}} operated as an interceptor, ground attack, and reconnaissance aircraft, using wing pods for <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> mission.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{along with}} the next continental US tests in 1951 set a precedent. In subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada test site, United States Atomic Energy Commission officials gave <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well as expected fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase uncontaminated materials and take other protective measures.|$|E

5|$|A {{highlight}} of the series in 1959 was when the Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> results of the Luna 3 probe, and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt {{to be the first to}} broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{was shot}} in {{temporary}} studios {{in the house of}} a priest named Moreira, which is now the location of the Jorge-Eliécer-Gaitán theatre. Initially, the film was shot with a Pathé camera with a 45mm lens, but later a 35mm Kodak Ektachrome was used. The chemicals used for the production of the film were purchased from Óptica Alemana, a company located in Bogotá founded in 1914 by Ernesto Schmidt Mumm. <b>The</b> <b>photographic</b> print was manufactured by the scientific section of airline SCADTA.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, two Bristol Blenheims of No. 114 Squadron RAF made {{an attack}} on Frecamp and Dieppe, {{dropping}} bombs from high altitude. The Germans recorded no damage at Frecamp, and the attack on Dieppe seems to have gone unnoticed. As the bombers headed home, they passed two Spitfires of <b>the</b> <b>Photographic</b> Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). These high-speed aircraft had been stripped of non-essential weight such as armament and radios and were fitted with cameras and extra fuel tanks. They photographed ports and airfields and then returned.|$|E
5000|$|The {{squadron}} {{was first}} activated in September 1942 as <b>the</b> 22d <b>Photographic</b> Reconnaissance Squadron, {{a component of}} <b>the</b> 5th <b>Photographic</b> Group.

5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} to stop by a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted responsibility for the attack, citing it as payback for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in a federal prison in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
