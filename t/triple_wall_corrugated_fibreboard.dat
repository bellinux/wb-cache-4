40|$|The New Zealand kiwifruit {{and apple}} {{industries}} export {{the two largest}} horticultural crops by value and tonnage on long sea routes to distant markets. The long storage and shipping times, low temperature (~ 0 °C) and high humidity (> 70 %RH) conditions require boxes manufactured from high performance <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard.</b> As the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> boxes are a significant expense, improvements to reduce the weight and therefore {{the cost of the}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> while maintaining their vertical compression strength, would increase the apple and kiwifruit industries profitability Through analysis of the literature it was established that the greatest contributor to box compression strength was the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> edgewise compression strength, which is significantly affected by moisture. The strength of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> decreases with increasing moisture content, which tends to be high in low-temperature high-humidity cool-stores. The literature also indicated that temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium could be optimised to reduce the damage caused during the fluting process. The objectives of this study included improving box compression strength predictions by measuring the effect of moisture and temperature on the strength of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and measuring the relationship between temperature, humidity and <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> moisture content. The objectives also included developing a mathematical model to optimise the operations preceding the fluting process by predicting the fluting medium moisture content and temperature just prior to the fluting process. The measurements of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> properties enabled the widely known McKee’s equation to be modified to enable the prediction of box compression strength over a range of moisture contents (7 to 30 %db), the valves of which could be estimated using the moisture sorption isotherms developed in this study over the temperature and relative humidity range of 0 to 20 °C and 40 to 90 %RH. A mathematical model was developed to predict how the operation of the corrugator would affect the temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium just prior to the fluting process. The model was tested by running the corrugator at normal and extreme settings based on the model’s predictions, and measuring the strength properties of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> produced. The measured strength properties indicated that the machine speed and steam shower could have an effect but the too were inconsistent to established firm conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> has {{in recent}} years been gaining {{attention}} {{as a replacement for}} polymeric materials for protective packaging for environmental reasons. The properties of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> make it a sustainable replacement for poly-foam and polystyrene. Pre-compressed multilayered fibreboard cushions have most of the structural resistance and damping removed, and the properties of air-flow through the flutes becomes a more predominant, they behave more like a soft spring. Artificially restricting the exiting airflow or prudently choosing the direction of flutes in the case of rectangular cushions, allows for the differing design situations that may be required. A mathematical model is developed, to describe the pre-compressing process. Mathematical models and software are developed, based on the airflow characteristics, that allow for the prediction of peak acceleration for differing end conditions or sizes providing the friction component can be estimated using iterative methods. The models were verified by a static compression test for the pre-compression and by dropping a mass, or platen and recording the resistive acceleration, or dynamic behaviour, over a time range. There exists an acceleration component prior to platen contact, which is also modelled and should be considered in the interpretation of test results. The study has presented three models to allow for the prediction of the behaviour of multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> for the use as protective cushions. The main thrust has been the behaviour of the airflow during and prior to impact whilst testing. The models developed will assist in the design of protective packaging and produce predictive tools for the use in the packaging industry...|$|R
40|$|Multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> has {{in recent}} years been gaining {{attention}} {{as a replacement for}} polymeric materials for protective packaging for environmental reasons. The properties of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> make it a sustainable replacement for poly-foam and polystyrene. Pre-compressed multilayered fibreboard cushions have most of the structural resistance and damping removed, they behave more like a soft spring. The performance of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> as a protective cushion is influenced by the amount of moisture present. The material stiffness is also dependent on the amount of moisture present. Static compression testing can be carried out to obtain stiffness data by measuring load versus controlled deflection, with stiffness being the load required to deflect a specified distance. The creep properties can be obtained by measuring deflection with a controlled force over a period of time, that is, creep is a measure of deflection per time under a constant force. Models can be developed to simulate creep data, the Voigt model of Visco-elasticity, a spring – damper model makes a reasonable choice of model. This model is an exponentially decaying expression that can be adapted with respect to static strain, stress or stiffness and can be fitted to creep data. Curve fitting with a non-linear optimisation technique shows the model has a reasonable fit with experimental data. Creep data and curve fitting shows an unexpected trend in that as the humidity level is raised the creep strain levels reduce. The effect of this is offset by higher static strains occurring at higher humidity levels. At higher humidity levels when using the exponential model the creep strain reaches the 63...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{loosely packed}} items in rigid or {{semi-rigid}} containers is widespread. These packages are very often handled by high speed equipment {{and put in}} different environmental conditions which includes the possibility of mechanical damage, due to shock, impact and compression. So {{care must be taken}} that damage does not occur to both package and contents. The development of analytical and simulation techniques for investigating the dynamic behaviour of a package subject to handling and distribution hazards is becoming more possible by the use {{of a wide range of}} available software. The modelling of the dynamic behaviour of packaging systems during handling and transport is achieved by mathematical analysis where possible and supported by computer simulation. The analysis was carried out for a range of body properties in order to test the results against experimental data. Investigations into the applied package force/motion and subsequent package impact and deformation were carried out with a view to gaining an understanding of the forces involved. The dynamic analysis was undertaken using commercially available software but it is necessary to develop special techniques to enable it to be applied to this type of problem. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> containers subjected to internal and external loading will be subjected to stress, strain, deflection, and buckling to side panels. A Finite Element method of analysis of the panel was developed. The reaction of the panel to loading can be observed by means of this method. The failure of the container due to the loading can be predicted and the variability of the material and the panel can be changed arbitrarily to test and analyze different packaging designs. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and container elements were treated as engineering structures so the engineering concepts of stress, stain, equilibrium and compatibility could be applied. A Finite Element method using the ANSYS code made it possible to analyze the structure behaviour and helps to partly solve the design optimization process for a corrugated container. The project includes four main aspects: Finite Element analysis of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and container elements subjected to internal and external load. 2 <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> material tests. 3 Modelling of a package-contents system 4 Simulation of the products-cushion-package system The main area of research that is described in this thesis is concerned with developing the analytical and experimental methods to model and analyze the behaviour of packaging. This enables the size of the cushioning structure to be minimized and the cushioning and package material to be selected appropriately.

40|$|Standard {{methods for}} the {{performance}} testing of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> boxes use some static or quasi-static characteristic of the box as the performance indicator. The aim of this project {{was to develop a}} performance-based test method for corrugated boxes for fresh horticultural produce, using a dynamic fatigue-type approach. It was hypothesised that a dynamic test is more appropriate for produce packaging due to the relatively dynamic nature of the produce distribution environment. Measurements were made of vibration, shock, temperature, relative humidity, and handling impacts in a typical produce distribution environment, and a dynamic performance test method was developed. It was concluded that this dynamic test method is more sensitive to performance differences between boxes than standard quasi-static methods. The dynamic tests, however, take considerably more time to conduct than standard quasi-static methods and are not suitable for automation. This dynamic test method may have uses in developing a database for the comparison of different box types, however for routine performance testing the quasistatic methods are more appropriate...|$|R

40|$|Cooling {{of freshly}} {{harvested}} produce {{is crucial for}} maintaining a high product quality for a prolonged storage period and to reduce postharvest losses. Modelling the cooling process of packed horticultural produce provides a means for improving package designs and cooling operations. In this work, a methodology to more accurately model the cooling process of randomly stacked produce in packages is presented. First, a validated geometrical 3 D shape model generator of apple fruit is used to create realistic CAD models. The generator also considers the biological variability of the produce shape to create a database of more than 100 representative fruits of each cultivar. A discrete element model (DEM) then randomly selects surface meshed bodies from the database to simulate the gravitational packing of produce in a designated box or bin. The resulting stacking pattern of the produce is used to generate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The CFD model solves the airflow, heat and mass transfer through the packages to evaluate the aerodynamic and cooling performance of packages under different conditions and configurations. The difference between using actual 3 D fruit shapes and an approach using equivalent spheres is demonstrated in a simulation study of forced airflow cooling of apple fruit (cv. Braeburn) packed in a “Supervent” telescopic <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> package under typical precooling conditions. The results are analysed in terms of pressure drop characteristics, velocity profiles and distribution of cooling rates expressed by local surface heat transfer coefficients. status: accepte...|$|R
