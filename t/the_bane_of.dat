FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained <b>the</b> <b>bane</b> <b>of</b> FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E

The government should devise schemes to avert this process and save the dwindling forest area and its flora and fauna. Tribal people have extraordinary understanding of forest flora and fauna which can be productively utilized. All the tribal peoples shall be employed {{by the government in}} the expansion and protection of forests and its wildlife till their descendants get educated and diversify into industrial and service sectors.|$|E

500|$|Marshall was not fond of Wilson, as he {{disagreed}} {{with him on}} a number of issues. Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings, Marshall's ideas were rarely considered for implementation, and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly. In 1913 Wilson took the then unheard-of step of meeting personally with members of the Senate to discuss policy. [...] Before this, presidents used the vice president (who serves as president of the senate) as a go-between; Wilson used the opportunity to show that he did not trust Marshall with delicate business. In his memoir, Marshall's only negative comment towards Wilson was, [...] "I have sometimes thought that great men are <b>the</b> <b>bane</b> <b>of</b> civilization, they are the real cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world". [...] Their relationship was described as one of [...] "functioning animosity".|$|E

500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets.

500|$|Most Old West men {{who were}} labeled as being [...] "gunfighters" [...] did not kill nearly as many men in gunfights as they were given credit for, if any at all.

Wyatt Earp with his brothers Morgan and Virgil along with Doc Holliday killed three outlaw Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. He has been said to have been involved in more than one hundred gunfights in his lifetime. But Prof. Bill O'Neal cites just five incidents in his Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters.
