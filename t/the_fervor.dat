25|$|During the 1960s Columbia {{experienced}} large-scale student activism centering {{over the}} Vietnam War {{and the demand}} for greater student rights. Many students, led by the Students for a Democratic Society and its President Mark Rudd protested the University's ties with the defense establishment and its controversial plans to build a gym in Morningside Park. <b>The</b> <b>fervor</b> on campus reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied various buildings on campus.

In Hanoi, the General Association of Students and Youth (Tong Hoi Sinh vien va Thanh Nien) was animated by <b>the</b> <b>fervor</b> of independence. The City University in Hanoi became a focal point of political agitation. By May and June, there was evidence that communist Cadres of the Viet Minh front, had infiltrated the university's youth and famine relief associations. In the face of the rising Viet Minh front, the Japanese attempted to contact its leaders, but their messengers were killed by the Viet Minh. The Kempeitai retaliated, arresting hundreds of pro-communist Vietnamese youths in late June.|$|E

They shaved their heads, grew mohawks and wore various punk accessories. Nelson and MacKaye even drove thumbtacks into the soles of their boots so they would make an [...] "ominous clacking" [...] sound when they walked. The band's visual presentation was at odds with their demeanor; according to MacKaye, [...] "In our shows and within our own community, we were totally goofy guys. We were painfully honest — we didn't shoplift, we didn't vandalize, we didn't spray-paint. [...] We don't do anything — everybody just hates us {{because of the way}} we look".|$|E
500|$|The campaign's {{strategy}} {{called for}} winning the initial two contests– the January 3, 2008, Iowa Republican caucuses and the adjacent-to-his-home-state January 8 New Hampshire primary– and propelling Romney nationally. However, he took second place in both, losing Iowa to a vastly outspent Huckabee who received {{more than twice the}} evangelical Christian votes, and losing New Hampshire to the resurgent McCain. Huckabee and McCain criticized Romney's image as a flip flopper and this label would stick to Romney through the campaign (one that Romney rejected as unfair and inaccurate, except for his acknowledged change of mind on abortion). Romney seemed to approach the campaign as a management consulting exercise, and showed a lack of personal warmth and political feel; journalist Evan Thomas wrote that Romney [...] "came off as a phony, even when he was perfectly sincere." [...] <b>The</b> <b>fervor</b> with which Romney adopted his new stances and attitudes contributed to the perception of inauthenticity that hampered the campaign. Romney's staff would conclude that competing as a candidate of social conservatism and ideological purity rather than of pragmatic competence had been a mistake.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the more}} popular social dances created during the 1980s was the Cabbage Patch. The rap group Gucci Crew II created the dance and {{introduced}} it in their 1987 song of the same name, [...] "The Cabbage Patch". Another popular social dance was the Roger Rabbit. This dance imitates the floppy movements of the lead cartoon character as seen in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The rap duo Kid 'n Play created the Kid 'n Play kick-step and performed it in their 1990 movie House Party. It is a variation on the Charleston with elements of the Roger Rabbit and the Running Man. The Running Man {{is one of the most}} recognizable hip-hop social dances. According to Essence magazine, Paula Abdul created the Running Man and taught the dance to Janet Jackson when she was working as her choreographer during Jackson's Control era. Jackson further popularized the dance when she performed it in her 1989 music video [...] "Rhythm Nation", and rapper MC Hammer kept <b>the</b> <b>fervor</b> going when he started to do the Running Man in his performances. The pop duo LMFAO brought the Running Man back into the mainstream with their song [...] "Party Rock Anthem", which was named the 2011 song of the summer by Billboard.com. The accompanying dance in the song called The Shuffle combines three social dances: the Running Man, the (half) Charleston, and the T-step.|$|E
500|$|Dipayan Pal of Mumbai Boss was {{disappointed}} {{in the book and}} theorized a number of reasons for it. He felt that the solid plot and the unambiguous storytelling of The Immortals of Meluha was missing in The Secret of the Nagas, whose ending failed to live up the curiosity. Pal particularly criticized Tripathi's language, saying [...] "It seems that while writing The Secret of the Nagas, much of Amish’s attention was upon language. There are obvious and woefully inept attempts at literary flair that make the novel a tiresome read. The book suffers from a rash of exclamation marks and unnecessary italics. Sentences have been sliced to create weak, dangling fragments ('Parashuram charged. Followed by his vicious horde'). Instead of simply talking, people bellow, scream, whisper and fall silent. They are flabbergasted, they pirouette {{in the middle of a}} fight, and use words like 'exponentially', 'gargantuan' and 'plethora' in their speech. The net result is text that is labored, trite and awkward." [...] Kishwar Desai from Asian Age felt that in The Secret of the Nagas, the characterization of Shiva lost some of <b>the</b> <b>fervor</b> in it from the first book, and is cast more as a Bollywood hero, comparable to the likes of actor Salman Khan. Desai also noticed that there were too many characters in the book, most of them remaining unexplored. Likening the book with a computer game, the reviewer concluded that [...] "one of the remarkable qualities of [...] is that it is a very visual tale and less like a literary exercise." [...] Some critics like Sandipan Deb of Outlook though favored the visual style more and felt that Tripathi stayed true to the fantasy genre.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor's {{nomination}} won {{praise from}} Democrats and liberals, and Democrats {{appeared to have}} sufficient votes to confirm her. The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms {{in a number of}} her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture: [...] "I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life." [...] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time. The remark now became widely known. The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a [...] "racist" [...] (although the latter later backtracked from that claim), while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling. Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark, and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been [...] "poor". Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, [...] "ultimately and completely" [...] a judge follows the law regardless of personal background. Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in Ricci v. DeStefano received the most attention during the early nomination discussion, motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case. In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29. A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo and was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation of Second Amendment rights. [...] Some of <b>the</b> <b>fervor</b> with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.|$|E
