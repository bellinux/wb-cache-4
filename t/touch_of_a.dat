5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes {{because they were too}} difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finger.|$|E
5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E

40|$|A {{flat surface}} {{is more often}} judged to be convex after the <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concave surface than after the <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convex surface. This haptic {{after-effect}} increases with the time of contact with the curved surface till it saturates, and it decreases with the time-lapse between the <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> the first surface and the next one. In this paper, the haptic after-effect <b>of</b> two successively <b>touched</b> spherically curved surfaces is investigated. It is found that both surfaces contribute to the after-effect, but the after-effect is not additive. The time course of the after-effect of two successive surfaces can be described by a first-order integrator with a single time constant of about 7 s and an amplitude equal {{to the difference between}} the saturation levels of the after-effects of the two surfaces when measured in isolation. The new saturation level is therefore equal to that of the after-effect of the most recently touched surface...|$|R

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available at the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> switch to appreciate.

500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide").

500|$|Nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) is a dense, volatile, and {{explosive}} liquid whose {{physical properties}} {{are similar to}} those of carbon tetrachloride, although one difference is that NCl3 is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl4 is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by Pierre Louis Dulong, who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour. Nitrogen tribromide (NBr3), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at −100°C. Nitrogen triiodide (NI3) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known earlier, is very shock-sensitive: it can be set off by the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feather, shifting air currents, or even alpha particles. For this reason, small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of [...] "chemical magic".|$|E

On September 11, CIM issued a press release that it had obtained permits for a 34-story, 690-unit apartment tower, which Crain's Chicago Business described as [...] "the biggest apartment tower the Loop has seen in decades". The official commencement of the glass-walled project was on October 29 with expected completion by Summer 2016 to include amenities such as outdoor pool and spa, plus a rooftop spa and fitness center.
