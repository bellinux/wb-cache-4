5|$|Most {{software}} {{that runs on}} Linux can run on FreeBSD using an optional built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer is not an emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{mathematical constant}} , sometimes called Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the natural logarithm. Although exponentiation of e could, in principle, be <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as exponentiation of any other real number, such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E

25|$|In about 13% of aortic dissections, no {{evidence}} of an intimal tear is found. In these cases, the inciting event {{is thought to be}} an intramural hematoma (caused by bleeding within the media). Since no direct connection exists between the true lumen and the false lumen in these cases, diagnosing an aortic dissection by aortography is difficult if the cause is an intramural hematoma. An aortic dissection secondary to an intramural hematoma should be <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as one caused by an intimal tear.|$|E

She telephoned Calvert-Jones in early January 1980 informing him of the situation. Two days later Rupert Murdoch issued a memo directing that she was to be <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the male pilot candidates.

25|$|Though Newsweek {{reported}} that the FBI had a file regarding Gamergate, no arrests have been made nor charges filed, {{and parts of the}} FBI investigation into the threats had been closed in September 2015 {{due to a lack of}} leads. Former FBI supervisory special agent for cybercrimes, Tim Ryan, stated that cyberharassment cases are a low priority for authorities because it is difficult to track down the perpetrator and they have lower penalties compared to other crimes they are tasked to enforce. In June 2015, the US Supreme Court ruled in Elonis v. United States that harassing messages sent online are not necessarily true threats that would be prosecutable under criminal law and, according to Pacific Standard, this poses a further challenge in policing Gamergate-related harassment. However, the Court's decision also suggested that if threats made over social media were found to be true threats, they should be <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as threats made in other forms of communication.|$|E
25|$|The first Filipinos {{immigrants}} {{that came}} to the United States were <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as any other group of immigrants. When {{the first group of}} Filipinos joined the theater community they also received a lot of backlash. One of the most common instances are racial issues. One of the most popular plays that had a lot of filipino actors, Miss Saigon, had the issue of casting a white actor for an Asian role (113). With this, it exposed the history of yellow face within the theater community. Another issue that was faced due to Miss Saigon was when it had its own production in the Philippines. J.V Ejercito, the owner of the production of Miss Saigon, {{became a member of the}} Philippine congress. J.V Ejercito’s background stirred up controversies since his father Joseph Estrada was still in power when the production was going on. The public implied that the production gained it money not through profit but through politics and free enterprise. During the production of Miss Saigon, the international work force for Filipinos was also rising. Filipinos were seen as Little Brown Fucking Machines (LBFM) my military men thus giving Filipinos the roles of prostitutes within plays. Because of Miss Saigon, Filipinos were then seen as maids and domestic helpers.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, 33 {{percent of}} the journalists on SVT and SR {{supported}} the Left Party, which {{was about the same}} as journalists in commercial broadcasting and print media, but significantly more than among the general public, among whom 15 percent supported the Left Party. Support for the Left Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Party was stronger among journalists on SVT and SR than the general public, while the Moderate Party, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats had significantly less support among SVT and SR journalists than the public. However, the study concluded that the private political opinions of the journalists had little impact on their work and that news stories are <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> regardless of the political color of the journalist, worth mentioning as well is that SJF, the organisation in which the study was conducted partly is a unionbased organisation which could skew the accuracy of the representation within the selection (lessening the validity of the survey) as it is possible it excludes some rightwing journalists. The University of Gothenburg also made another study during the Swedish 2006 general election, comparing SVT's news programme Rapport to the country's five largest newspapers. The study concluded that Rapport's coverage of the election was the most balanced of them all.|$|E
25|$|Split: If {{the first}} two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer {{separates}} the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; {{except for a few}} restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, but not one of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are <b>treated</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.|$|E
