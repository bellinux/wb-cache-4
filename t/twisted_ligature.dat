40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{determine}} the load and deflection at failure of different lingual retainers bonded with composite to enamel in a standardized three-point bending test. The results were rationalized with finite element analysis (FEA) models. Materials and methods: Four types of multistranded wires, Dead Soft Respond, <b>Twisted</b> <b>ligature,</b> Penta-One, Gold-plated Penta-One, and two glass fibre-reinforced composite retainers, Fibre 07 and Fibre 09, were bonded to enamel with composite and submitted to a three-point bending test. The load and deflection at failure and the mode of debonding were recorded. The stiffness of the wires was determined and all experimental data were used in FEA models to rationalize the observed values and mode of debonding. Results: Significant higher load and deflection were found for the most flexible retainers <b>Twisted</b> <b>ligature</b> and Dead Soft Respond. All retainers failed between the wire and composite, which was confirmed by FEA showing the highest stress in the composite around the retainer. The FEA models showed that the amount of composite used for bonding the retainers should be 2 - 4 mm. Conclusions: Based on the in vitro results, optimal bonding of lingual retainers can be achieved by flexible retainers, bonded with intrinsically strong composites. According to the FEA models the retainer should be bonded with 2 - 4 mm composite, leaving the critical ‘free-wire’ length for the success of the retainer system...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the type of ligation influences the frictional resistance between stainless steel wire and brackets when the wire is subjected to repeated vertical displacements. Methods: Eight different types of ligation were used to secure a length of stainless steel wire in three stainless steel twin brackets. The wire was subjected to repeated vertical displacements in a simulated extraction space. Eighty per cent of the minimum force required to overcome static friction (F-m) between the wire and brackets {{was applied to the}} wire for eight minutes and any sliding measured. Results: Frictional resistance to sliding was least when stainless steel <b>ligatures</b> <b>twisted</b> in a figure 8 pattern until taut then untwisted one quarter turn were used, and greatest when elastomeric modules in a figure 8 pattern (EM 8) were used. The F-m difference between fully engaged standard and Super Slick elastomeric modules was significantly different (p = 0. 007). The frictional resistance to sliding fell when the wire was secured with either of these two methods and subjected to vertical displacement loads. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of wire movement between these modules. Conclusion: Repeated vertical displacement reduced the frictional resistance to sliding for all methods of ligation except EM 8. The stainless steel <b>twist</b> <b>ligatures</b> demonstrated the lowest frictional resistance to sliding. Nathawut Sirisaowaluk, Olena Kravchuk and Christopher T. C. Ho[URL]...|$|R
