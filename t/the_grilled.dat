5|$|In 2017, Burger King {{once again}} reformulated its grilled chicken sandwich, simply calling it <b>the</b> <b>Grilled</b> Chicken Sandwich. The new {{formulation}} changes out the brioche bun for a potato roll {{and a new}} seasoned chicken fillet.|$|E

To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, <b>the</b> <b>grilled</b> chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E

It has been sold under various names since 1996, when it was introduced as <b>the</b> <b>Grilled</b> Chicken Deluxe, and had its name changed to the Chicken McGrill in 1998. It was replaced with a Premium chicken sandwich in July 2005, which was in turn replaced with the Artisan Grilled Chicken in 2015.

25|$|McChicken LT (McDonald's Chicken Lettuce and Tomato) was {{the chicken}} {{version of the}} McDLT {{featuring}} the same two-sided container as the McDLT except the packaging was yellow instead of white. It was introduced {{about the same time}} as the McDLT in the mid-1980s. The chicken was a grilled, unbreaded chicken breast placed on the heel of the bun in one of the compartments. The toppings were shredded lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise assembled on the top half of the bun in the other compartment. Cheese was an optional addition for an extra US$0.10. <b>The</b> <b>grilled</b> chicken breast was then basted with a brushing of melted butter. As with the McDLT, the consumer would finalize preparation of the sandwich by combining the hot and cool sides just prior to eating. The McChicken LT was discontinued in the Fall of 1987.|$|E

500|$|While McDonald's {{had been}} trying to develop and test a similar product for several years, the company was caught off guard at the time when its {{mainline}} competitors introduced their grilled chicken products and was not able to initially deploy a similar product. This was primarily due to the fact the company's highly specialized kitchens could not produce a high quality product without a large investment in new equipment. By early 1991, McDonald's grilled chicken product was still in development, and the vendor would not introduce its version, the McGrilled Chicken Classic, until 1994. The McGrilled chicken sandwich was replaced with <b>the</b> <b>Grilled</b> Chicken Deluxe sandwich in September and October 1996 as part of McDonald's Deluxe line of [...] "upscale" [...] sandwiches; the company had hoped that a higher value product would help improve average check performance at its stores. However, by 1998 the whole Deluxe line was said to be not selling well, and <b>the</b> <b>Grilled</b> Chicken Deluxe was eliminated when McDonald's brought back the Chicken McGrill sandwich back in 1999. The Chicken McGrill sandwich was retired in 2005 when the company introduced its new Premium line of products, which like the TenderCrisp sandwich was targeted to a more adult audience with higher quality ingredients such as natural cheeses and whole leaf lettuce. Beginning in April 2015, McDonald's moved to a new grilled chicken sandwich, the Artisan Grilled Chicken; the new chicken uses a smaller list of ingredients in the chicken filet, removing ingredients such as maltodextrin and sodium phosphates. The new sandwich is in response to consumer-based market trends of food products that have simpler, more natural ingredients.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>grilled</b> chicken {{sandwich}} is {{a chicken}} sandwich, {{consisting of a}} [...] flame-grilled chicken breast filet, mayonnaise, lettuce and tomatoes on a potato roll. In some Asian markets, such as Singapore, the filet is made from chicken thigh meat and uses a sesame-seed bun. Burger King will also add any condiment it sells upon request based on its long standing slogan [...] "Have It Your Way". Additionally, Burger King has sold several different promotional varieties throughout the years as limited time offerings (LTO), such as Chicken Caesar Club, made with Romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, bacon and caesar dressing on toasted sourdough bread, or the Carolina BBQ TenderGrill made with pepper jack cheese, bacon, jalapeños, red onion and a mustard-based barbecue sauce which was sold during Burger King's 2012 and 2013 Summer BBQ Menu promotions.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, Burger King's chain-wide {{sales were}} lagging. [...] Corporate {{indifference}} from parent Diageo coupled with lagging sales at larger franchises caused by declining consumer demand for its products led {{the company to}} initiate a menu redesign to try to lure customers back into stores. The company decided to introduce a series of new product launches in a planned menu revamp. Along with a new Whopper-based burger designed to compete with McDonald's Quarter Pounder, a new breakfast sandwich designed {{to compete with the}} McMuffin sandwich, and other new products, Burger King introduced a reformulated Big King replacement called the King Supreme. The new sandwich's ingredients were basically the same as the Big King, but the King Sauce used in the sandwich was reformulated to, according to company claims, enhance the savory nature of <b>the</b> <b>grilled</b> burger patties Burger King uses in its sandwiches. This knock-off driven menu reorganization was designed to better compete with a similar menu expansion at McDonald's, called the New Tastes Menu, introduced earlier the same year.|$|E

It featured a honey mustard-type sauce, quarter-pound beef patty on a potato roll, with leaf lettuce, tomato, red onion, and cheese; peppered bacon was also offered for an extra charge. The Arch Deluxe was accompanied with three other burgers at the time, the Crispy Chicken Deluxe (later renamed the Crispy Chicken Sandwich), <b>the</b> <b>Grilled</b> Chicken Deluxe (later renamed the Chicken McGrill), and the Fish Filet Deluxe (since discontinued along with the Arch Deluxe itself).|$|E

5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop <b>the</b> <b>grill.</b> <b>The</b> <b>grill</b> was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on <b>the</b> hot <b>grill,</b> <b>the</b> pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop <b>the</b> <b>grill.</b> After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|R

60|$|To our shame {{we had a}} very {{pleasant}} supper that night off <b>the</b> <b>grilled</b> fish, which was excellent, and some tinned meat. I say to our shame, in a sense, for on our companions the sharks were supping and by rights we should have been sunk in woe. I suppose that the sense of our own escape intoxicated us. Also, notwithstanding his joviality, none of us had cared much for the captain, and his policy had been to keep us somewhat apart from the crew, of whom therefore we knew but little. It is true that Bastin held services on Sundays, for such as would attend, and Bickley had doctored a few of them for minor ailments, but there, except for a little casual conversation, our intercourse began and ended.|$|E
6000|$|I ought, perhaps, to {{say here}} that, {{in spite of the}} luxury of their appointments, and their {{extraordinary}} habit of [...] "eating and drinking all day to the going down of the sun" [...] (as one of their own poets says), these islanders are by no means good cooks. I have tasted of more savoury meats, dressed in coverings of leaves on hot stones, in Maori pahs, or in New Caledonian villages, than among the comparatively civilized natives of the country where I now found myself. Among the common people, especially, there was no notion of hanging or keeping meat. Often have I seen a man kill a hog on the floor of his house, cut it up, toast it, as one may say, at the fire, and then offer <b>the</b> <b>grilled</b> and frequently under- done flesh to his guests. Invariably the guests are obliged to witness the slaughter of the animal which is to supply their dinner. This slaughter is performed as a kind of sacrifice; the legs of the beast are the portions of the gods, and are laid, with bits of fat, upon the altars. Then chops, or rather kabobs, of meat are hacked off, spitted, and grilled or roasted at the fire. Consequently all the meat tasted in this island is actually [...] "meat offered to idols." ...|$|E
