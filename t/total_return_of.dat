25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007 Migden helped resolve a five-year- {{standoff}} between Marin county {{and the state of}} California regarding property taxes taken by the State and diverted to fund education deficits. With rising property tax values, the state decided to withhold an additional 4 million of county generated tax revenues to pay for programs for troubled children throughout California. Marin officials claimed the state was forcing the county to shoulder an unfair degree of state oriented funding. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed two bills pushed forward by Migden to resolve the issue. Migden's third bill passed and resulted in cutting the amount of surplus funds the county will annually pay to the state by half. The bill resulted in an extra 1.9million a year for Marin County and a <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 24.7million to the area.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} inflation-indexed bonds, {{fixed-income}} securities {{linked to a}} specific price index. The most common examples are US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and UK Index Linked Gilts. The interest and principal repayments under this type of bond are adjusted in line with a Consumer Price Index (in the US this is the CPI-U for urban consumers). This means that these bonds are guaranteed to outperform the inflation rate (unless (a) the market price has increased so that the [...] "real" [...] yield is negative, which {{is the case in}} 2012 for many such UK bonds, or (b) the government or other issuer defaults on the bond). This allows investors of all types to preserve the purchasing power of their money even at times of high inflation. For example, assuming 3.88% inflation over the course of 1 year (just about the 56 year average inflation rate, through most of 2006), and a real yield of 2.61% (the fixed US Treasury real yield on October 19, 2006, for a 5 yr TIPS), the adjusted principal of the fixed income would rise from 100 to 103.88 and then the real yield would be applied to the adjusted principal, meaning 103.88 x 1.0261, which equals 106.5913; giving a <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 6.5913%. TIPS moderately outperform conventional US Treasuries, which yielded just 5.05% for a 1 yr bill on October 19, 2006.|$|E

40|$|Version of RecordWe explore for {{presence}} of monthly seasonality in monthly <b>total</b> <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> U. S. long term government bonds from January 1926 to December 2007. We test {{three types of}} effects with respect to monthly seasonality. We further partition the data into three sub-periods and explore monthly seasonality. In addition, we explore monthly seasonality based on Republican and Democratic presidencies. We look at the nature <b>of</b> monthly <b>returns</b> during contraction and expansion periods, as well as periods of crisis. The mean <b>of</b> monthly <b>total</b> <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> long term government bonds for the entire data set (0. 47 %) was significantly greater than zero. The mean <b>of</b> monthly <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> none of the months was significantly greater than {{the mean of the}} other eleven months stacked together. We find evidence of month effect with respect to variances <b>of</b> monthly <b>returns.</b> When we partition the data into three sub-periods, we do not find any discernible monthly seasonality. We also find the mean <b>of</b> monthly <b>returns</b> during the Republican presidencies to be significantly higher than during the Democratic presidencies. Government bond returns were on average significantly higher during contraction periods than during expansion periods. The Great Depression was good for the bond market; war periods were comparatively not as attractive for bond investing because governments tend to peg interest rates during such periods. Though not fully efficient, the U. S. long term government bond market exhibits a high degree of efficiency. Hamid, S. A. & Habib, A. (2010).
