5|$|After {{visiting the}} near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors {{go to the}} Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and {{retrieve}} the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over. With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) {{back in time and}} he sent the Fiends to <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> do so, creating a time loop by which he could live forever. The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.|$|E

5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>to</b> fulfill a promise made to his mother.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a 24-year-old Hope is {{leader of}} the {{scientific}} expedition group known as the Academy {{a decade after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII. He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time. Other than knowing that time travel is possible and wishing to undo events of the past, Hope is planning on reviving Cocoon with a different power source. Originally planning to create an artificial fal'Cie, he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation. He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle then use a time capsule to go 387 years into <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> oversee Hope's New Cocoon Project, a plan to build a man-made Cocoon in preparation for Cocoon's destined fall in the next century. When the old Cocoon does fall, Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>to</b> increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E
40|$|To {{the extent}} that NYSE Rule 80 A collar, which restricts index {{arbitrage}} form of program trading on volatile days, aims to delink S&P 500 cash and futures markets and prevent transmission of volatility from <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cash market, this study finds the collar to be ineffective. The analyses are based on lead-lag regressions {{for the first and}} second moments using data diurnalized via a nonparametric filter for intraday volatility periodicity. The regression results also suggest that, consistent with <b>the</b> literature, <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market has a much stronger tendency to lead the underlying cash market than lag and there is a strong bi-directional lead-lag relationship between volatilities of the two markets, which does not support the assertion that there is a systematic transmission of volatility from <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cash market. ...|$|R

5|$|In a later scene, Marcus {{encounters}} Sal. Marcus {{wants to}} apologize for his misbehavior, and chases Sal when he flees. Sal runs onto a street right ahead of an oncoming truck. Before the truck can hit Sal, the laughing man kicks Sal out of the way, sacrificing his own life for Sal's. Miranda finds the fourth note in Richard's shoe and learns that the laughing man came from <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> save Sal's life.

5|$|Kessler then invites Cole to {{join him}} for a final fight in the same {{location}} where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending himself back in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.|$|E
5|$|Miranda's mom {{is invited}} {{to appear on the}} $20,000 Pyramid. In hopes of winning the money and having a better life, Miranda and her mom's boyfriend Richard prep her for the show. Miranda and Sal are friends again. While her mother is on-stage, Miranda reminisces about a {{conversation}} with Marcus about how no one would recognize a time-traveler from a different age. She suddenly realizes that the laughing man is an older incarnation of Marcus, who has come from <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> save Sal's life. He needed to deliver the notes to the young Marcus through Miranda. Later on Miranda goes to the mailbox the laughing man (Marcus) slept under, where she finds a picture of an older version of Julia smiling happily. The novel ends as Miranda reflects on the events in an epilogue.|$|E

5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo a {{supernova}} at some point in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was certainly {{in the final stages of}} its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>to</b> remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E

5|$|The Maya made meticulous {{observations}} of celestial bodies, patiently recording astronomical {{data on the}} movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and the stars. This information was used for divination, so Maya astronomy was essentially for astrological purposes. Maya astronomy did not serve to study the universe for scientific reasons, nor was it used to measure the seasons in order to calculate crop planting. It was rather used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>to</b> produce prophecy. The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed. Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device. Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that, at the time of European contact, the Maya had recorded eclipse tables, calendars, and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe.|$|E
