5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing The Daily Show and <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E
5|$|Subtle {{problems}} with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract <b>thinking,</b> <b>or</b> impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of {{the early stages of}} AD. Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties are also common.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms {{will include}} swelling, edema, and pain from a {{multitude}} of secondary complications (pressure, musculoskeletal disorder from asymmetry, restricted blood flow). Most patients will avoid discussing pain for many reasons, so this will require logical <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> communication skills to assess. In advanced lymphedema, there may be the presence of skin changes such as discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and Ulcer (dermatology).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, a bug {{is not an}} {{isolated}} flaw, but represents an error of <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> planning {{on the part of the}} programmer. Such logic errors require a section of the program to be overhauled or rewritten. As a part of code review, stepping through the code and imagining or transcribing the execution process may often find errors without ever reproducing the bug as such.|$|E

25|$|The Turing test is {{concerned}} strictly {{with how the}} subject acts– the external behaviour of the machine. In this regard, it takes a behaviourist or functionalist approach {{to the study of}} the mind. The example of ELIZA suggests that a machine passing the test may be able to simulate human conversational behaviour by following a simple (but large) list of mechanical rules, without <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> having a mind at all.|$|E
25|$|Strategic {{management}} {{involves the}} related concepts of strategic planning and strategic thinking. Strategic planning is analytical {{in nature and}} refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens around the strategic <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> strategy making activity.|$|E
25|$|J. P. Guilford drew a {{distinction}} between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.|$|E

25|$|An open {{question}} is if other animals besides humans have a genetic endowment and social environment {{that allows them}} to acquire a theory of mind {{in the same way that}} human children do. This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from animal behavior the existence of <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of self or self-awareness, consciousness and qualia. One difficulty with non-human studies of ToM is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) is a {{group of}} {{permanent}} movement disorders that appear in early childhood. Signs and symptoms vary among people. Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, swallowing, and speaking. Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl, or walk as early as other children of their age. Other symptoms include seizures and problems with <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> reasoning, each of which occurs in about one third of people with CP. While the symptoms may get more noticeable over {{the first few years of}} life, the underlying problems do not worsen over time.|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{computer}} {{to play music}} was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the Colonel Bogey March, of which no known recordings exist. However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and {{was not used to}} extend musical <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> composition practice. CSIRAC was never recorded, but the music played was accurately reconstructed. The oldest known recordings of computer-generated music were played by the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, a commercial version of the Baby Machine from the University of Manchester in the autumn of 1951. The music program was written by Christopher Strachey.|$|E

25|$|However, Robert D. Hare, a {{psychologist}} working in criminology, developed an influential Psychopathy Checklist {{based on the}} psychopath construct developed by Cleckley. Later two items {{were removed from the}} checklist in order to more clearly represent the structure of a two-factor analysis. Grandiosity, impulsivity and juvenile delinquency were not in Cleckley's criteria but were put into Hare's, who left out Cleckley's core criteria of no significant irrational <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> anxiety. Hare has written that The Mask of Sanity has such detailed and complex descriptions and speculations that it can support a variety of different interpretations. He suggests it is necessary to interpret it with supporting evidence, though notes that it has virtually no empirical data to enable this.|$|E
25|$|Language {{acquisition}} in multilingual {{individuals is}} contingent on two factors: {{age of the}} language acquisition and proficiency. Specialization is centered in the perisylvian cortex of the left hemisphere. Various regions of both {{the right and left}} hemisphere activate during language production. Multilingual individuals consistently demonstrate similar activation patterns in the brain when using either one of the two or more languages they fluently know. Age of acquiring the second-or-higher language, and proficiency of use determine what specific brain regions and pathways activate when using (<b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> speaking) the language. In contrast to those who acquired their multiple languages at different points in their life, those who acquire multiple languages when young, and at virtually the same time, show similar activations in parts of Broca's area and left inferior frontal lobe. If the second-or-higher language is acquired later in life, specifically after the critical period, the language becomes centralized in a different part of Broca's area than the native language and other languages learned when young.|$|E
25|$|While {{cognitive}} science endeavors to explain human thought and the conscious mind, {{the work of}} cognitive biology {{is focused on the}} most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large and small, both plant and animal. “Mounting evidence suggests that even bacteria grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with conspecifics and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.” Without <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> perceiving as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a stimulus, then finds an appropriate response in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is {{due to the lack of}} a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a science of cognitive biology has yet to be established. A prolegomena for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.|$|E

500|$|The {{philosophy}} of mind also has important {{consequences for the}} concept of self. If by [...] "self" [...] or [...] "I" [...] one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the person, some modern philosophers of mind, such as Daniel Dennett believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion. The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives {{from the idea of}} an immaterial soul. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of [...] "self" [...] as postulated by David Hume, who could never catch himself not doing, <b>thinking</b> <b>or</b> feeling anything. However, in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology, developmental biology and neuroscience, the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.|$|E
