5|$|After the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic {{signed the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers on 3 March 1918, exiting the war, {{forces of the}} Central Powers {{surrounded}} and later seized the port of Sevastopol. UB-14 was at Sevastopol after the Germany signed the armistice <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> ended all fighting on 11 November. UB-14 and the three other surviving Constantinople Flotilla boats were disarmed on 25 November. UB-14 was scuttled in the Black Sea off Sevastopol {{in the early months}} of 1919.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Aldea died {{in autumn}} 1436, {{enabling}} Vlad Dracul to seize Wallachia with Hungarian support.

Argentina and Chile immediately annulled the 1902 <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> had ended their naval arms race, and both planned to expand their own navies, though Chile was delayed by a financial depression in 1907 and a major earthquake the next year.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, {{negotiated}} in {{settlement of the}} Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during {{the remainder of the}} President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} Roman-Pergamese army {{started their}} march from Ephesus. They advanced inland passing Magnesia on the Maeander {{and into the}} territory of Alabanda where they were met by 1,000 infantry and 300 cavalry led by Attalus' brother.

5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> {{is based on the}} United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E

5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted {{an invitation to a}} three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Ceasefire {{negotiations}} {{began in}} 1285, {{and ended with}} Narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in June 1286. The Burmese embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in January 1287, agreed to a <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> acknowledged the suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty or the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government {{in exchange for the}} evacuation of Mongol troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never really took effect as Narathihapate was assassinated in July 1287, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles <b>Treaty</b> <b>that</b> had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow. The fleet rendezvoused {{with the}} British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace <b>treaty.</b> <b>That</b> morning, the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and while they were away Reuter issued the order to scuttle the High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Cuba was in {{the midst}} of a {{constitutional}} crisis as a result of a disputed election and an attempt by elected President Tomás Estrada Palma to stay in power after the conclusion of his term. This led to a revolt, and the U.S. military sent in 5,600 men to reassert control over the country in what would be called the Second Occupation of Cuba. This was permitted under the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903, a <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> stipulated the degree of United States intervention in Cuba. After a brief period of stabilization by Secretary Taft, Magoon was appointed governor under the Constitution of Cuba, effectively with absolute authority and backed by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|In James Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis <b>Treaty</b> <b>that</b> transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander {{crossed the}} Taurus into Cilicia. After {{a long pause}} due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' {{significantly}} larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a peace <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Roman–Persian Wars {{continued}} until 561 when the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau {{agreed on a}} 50-year peace. By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with the notable exception of the Balkans, which were subjected to repeated incursions from the Slavs and the Gepids. Tribes of Serbs and Croats were later resettled in the northwestern Balkans, {{during the reign of}} Heraclius. Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement and defeated the new Hunnish threat. The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the Kutrigur Huns to withdraw and they agreed to a <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> allowed safe passage back across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Navajo {{acquired}} the Iberian Churra, a {{breed of sheep}} from Spanish explorers. These animals were developed into a unique breed by the Navajo, today called the Navajo-Churro. These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and that produced a useful long-staple wool. Hand-spun wool from these animals was {{the main source of}} yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock. The 1869 peace <b>treaty</b> <b>that</b> allowed the Navajo to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock. The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.|$|E
