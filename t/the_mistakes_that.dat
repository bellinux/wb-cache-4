5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain in the face of <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift in focus and a realisation of <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E

25|$|Hayek {{served in}} World War I {{and said that}} his {{experience}} in the war and his desire to help avoid <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> had led to the war drew him into economics. Hayek lived in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany and became a British subject in 1938. He {{spent most of his}} academic life at the London School of Economics (LSE), the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg.|$|E

25|$|In April 1979, HBO {{launched}} its {{first attempt at}} a spin-off service, Take 2. Designed as a family-oriented mini-pay service, Take 2 was essentially formatted {{as an alternative to}} HBO, without any R-rated program content. The channel was ultimately deemed a major failure due to low subscribership and limited carriage by cable providers, and ceased operations late that summer. HBO management analysized <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> led to Take 2's downfall, which would result {{in the development of the}} network's second and more successful attempt at a secondary pay service, the movie-focused Cinemax, which launched on August 1, 1980.|$|E

500|$|Lewis Hamilton {{was criticized}} for his {{aggressive}} drive into the first corner by much of the British press. Edward Gorman of The Times described Hamilton's move as [...] "impetuosity and untamed aggression", adding that Hamilton [...] "gambled with a kamikaze attempt to get past Räikkönen". The BBC's Andrew Benson said that [...] "Hamilton is still in a strong position but the Englishman will have to cut out <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> have characterised his season {{if he is not}} to lose the championship {{for the second year in}} a row." [...] In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport said that Hamilton's start suffered from [...] "his usual excessive aggression". Hamilton said [...] "I made a mistake and I paid for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} in Rio Grande do Sul was chaotic, {{and the local}} military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the Paraguayan army. PedroII, aware of the danger, {{decided to go to}} the front to shore up operations. As the Emperor's military aide-de-camp, Caxias followed him into the combat zone. The marquis had warned the Progressive cabinet that Brazil was unprepared to intervene in Uruguay and even less prepared to resist a foreign invasion. His warnings were ignored, and he complained, with a bit of irony, to his friend João Maurício Vanderlei, Baron of Cotejipe, a former colleague in the Conciliation cabinet: [...] "I am almost mad with <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> I am seeing being made, but since I am a red [...] I am not listened to, since everything is progress in our country." ...|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E

500|$|White {{was unable}} to {{completely}} halt the slide in circulation, though it rose a little in 1977. [...] That year Cohen lost $15,000 dollars on the magazines, and decided to sell. [...] He spent some time {{looking for a new}} publisher—editor Roy Torgeson was one of those interested—but on September 15, 1978, he sold his half of the business to Arthur Bernhard, his partner. [...] White renewed his suggestions for improving the format of the magazine: he wanted to make Fantastic the same size as Time, and believed he could avoid <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> had been made by other sf magazines that had tried that approach. [...] White also proposed an increase in the budget and asked for a raise. [...] Bernhard not only turned down White's ideas, but also stopped paying him: White responded by resigning. [...] His last official day as editor was November 9; the last issue of Fantastic under his control was the January 1979 issue. [...] He returned all submissions to their authors, saying that he had been told to do so by Bernhard; Bernhard denied this.|$|E
500|$|Barry and Oliver {{devise a}} plan to deliver Kendra and Carter as a ruse to {{get close enough to}} Savage to destroy the staff. The plan goes horribly wrong; Kendra's powers fail and Savage quickly overcomes the element of {{surprise}} and kills both her and Carter before using the staff to destroy Central City. Barry escapes and runs fast enough to go back in time to the point of the original negotiation before everyone else dies. Barry informs Oliver of his time travel and <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> led to defeat. They change their approach to the plan and Barry is able to steal the staff. He and Oliver use it on Savage, burning his body. Kendra and Carter decide to use their powers to help others in another city. Cisco gives Kendra a tracking device. Oliver agrees to Samantha's conditions for him to see William. Even though Barry encourages Oliver to tell Felicity about William (she has lost this knowledge because of Barry's time traveling) he decides to continue to keep the secret from her. Malcolm collects Savage's ashes while whispering, [...] "You owe me one, buddy." ...|$|E
500|$|Pakistan {{decided to}} reopen the supply lines after US Secretary of State apologised on 3 July 2012 for the Salala {{incident}} via a telephone call to Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar.

[...] US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta said in a separate statement that the US [...] "remains committed to improving our partnership with Pakistan and to working closely together as our two nations confront common security challenges in the region", US General John R.

500|$|With 3 RAR {{achieving}} limited {{results in}} AO Manly, MacDonald suggested that Dunstan establish the battalion {{in a new}} location east of Route 16 in order to locate and destroy the North Vietnamese bases suspected {{to be in the}} area. 3 RAR subsequently occupied FSB Balmoral in AO Newport, [...] north of Coral, on 24 May in the hope of provoking another battle. Shelton was keen to avoid <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> had been made during the earlier occupation of FSB Coral however, and he sent two companies forward on foot to occupy the new fire support base while the battalion tactical headquarters accompanied them in APCs. During the insertion {{there were a number of}} contacts between the Australians and North Vietnamese, with at least one North Vietnamese soldier being killed. Yet with B and D Companies securing the landing zone, the remainder of 3 RAR was inserted by helicopter from FSB Coogee in the late afternoon. FSB Balmoral would be developed as a battalion defensive position only, and 161st Battery RNZA was subsequently flown to FSB Coral, in order to concentrate all of the artillery in that location from where they would be able to cover the whole of the new AO. Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese had been caught by surprise and, with no time prepare an attack, they were unable to respond on the first evening. Regardless, 3 RAR worked quickly to establish their defensive position, digging in and laying wire and claymore mines.|$|E
500|$|Attempting {{to bolster}} the North's {{defenses}} in [...] "Dragonstone", Jon is frustrated when his authority is undermined by Sansa, who does {{not want him to}} repeat <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> got their father Ned and brother Robb killed. Jon dismisses a message from Cersei Lannister that he swear his allegiance to her. In [...] "Stormborn", he receives an invitation to Dragonstone from Tyrion on Daenerys Targaryen's behalf. Subsequently, receiving a message from Sam that a hoard of obsidian lies beneath the ancient Targaryen castle, Jon decides to meet Daenerys, leaving a surprised Sansa as his regent. At Dragonstone, he declines swearing fealty to Daenerys in [...] "The Queen's Justice", and instead asks for her assistance fighting the White Walkers. She demurs, but permits him to mine the obsidian. In [...] "Eastwatch", Daenerys is surprised when her dragon Drogon approaches Jon and allows the King in the North to pet him. Determined to convince Cersei that their true enemy is the army of the dead, Jon leads an expedition north of the Wall to capture a wight and bring it south to King's Landing. They manage to do so in [...] "Beyond the Wall", but are surrounded by a horde of the Night King's minions. Daenerys arrives with her dragons, but the Night King kills one of them with an ice spear, forcing the others to flee without Jon. He is saved by the reappearance of his uncle Benjen, who is overtaken by the dead as Jon escapes back to the Wall. Daenerys vows to fight the White Walkers with Jon, and he agrees to swear fealty to her as his queen. In [...] "The Dragon and the Wolf", the two negotiate a truce with Cersei, who agrees to join them in fighting the Night King's forces. Bran learns that Jon was born Aegon Targaryen, the legitimate son and heir of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Meanwhile, Jon and Daenerys finally give in to their growing attraction for each other and fall into bed together, unaware that they are related by blood.|$|E
