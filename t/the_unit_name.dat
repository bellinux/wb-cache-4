500|$|<b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> [...] "megagram" [...] {{is rarely}} used, {{and even then}} {{typically}} only in technical fields in contexts where especially rigorous consistency with the SI standard is desired. For most purposes, the name [...] "tonne" [...] is instead used. The tonne and its symbol, [...] "t", were adopted by the CIPM in 1879. It is a non-SI unit accepted by the BIPM for use with the SI. According to the BIPM, [...] "In English speaking countries this unit is usually called 'metric ton'." [...] <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> [...] "megatonne" [...] or [...] "megaton" [...] (Mt) is often used in general-interest literature on greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the equivalent unit in scientific papers on the subject is often the [...] "teragram" [...] (Tg).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>unit</b> is <b>named</b> after <b>the</b> Swedish {{physicist}} Anders Jonas Ångström (1814-1874). The symbol {{is always}} written with a ring diacritic, as {{the letter in}} the Swedish alphabet. <b>The</b> <b>unit's</b> <b>name</b> is often written in English without the diacritics, but the official definitions do contain them. It is {{not a part of}} the SI system of units.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> was {{identified}} as an Air Resupply Group, <b>the</b> <b>unit's</b> <b>name</b> was deliberately misleading, as {{the mission of the}} 582nd was support of special operations over Soviet occupied territory.|$|R
500|$|A {{space between}} the number and the unit symbol (i.e., no hyphen) is {{specified}} when the combination is used as an adjective, e.g. [...] "a 25kg sphere".

500|$|The SI symbols for {{the metric}} units are {{intended}} to be identical, regardless of the language used but unit names are ordinary nouns and use the character set and follow the grammatical rules of the language concerned. For example, the SI unit symbol for kilometre is [...] "km" [...] everywhere in the world, even though the local language word for <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> may vary. Language variants for the kilometre unit name include: [...] (Italian), [...] (German), [...] (Dutch), [...] (French), [...] (Greek), [...] (Portuguese), [...] (Spanish) and [...] (Russian).|$|E

2500|$|In Chinese, the [...] "New" [...] is {{only added}} in formal {{contexts}} {{where it is}} necessary to avoid any ambiguity, even though ambiguity is virtually non-existent today. These contexts include banking, contracts, or foreign exchange. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> in Chinese is yuán. In Taiwan, the character for yuan can be written in either of two forms: [...] or , which are interchangeable.

2500|$|The {{symbol for}} <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> itself {{is written in}} lower-case letters unless the unit has been named after a person {{in which case the}} first letter is upper-case - thus watts and pascals have the symbols [...] "W" [...] and [...] "Pa" [...] {{respectively}} while metres and seconds have the symbols [...] "m" [...] and [...] "s". However, an exception has been made {{in the case of the}} litre - since the letter [...] "l" [...] is easily confused with the number [...] "1", the symbol for the litre may be either [...] "l" [...] or [...] "L" [...] - thus either [...] "ml" [...] or mL" [...] may be used as the symbol for millilitres. The names of the units themselves are common nouns, not proper nouns, so in most languages using the Latin script they are written in lower-case unless there is a grammatical reason to do otherwise (such as being the first word of a sentence).|$|E
2500|$|Before the 13th CGPM in 1967–1968, {{the unit}} kelvin {{was called a}} [...] "degree", the same as with the other {{temperature}} scales at the time. It was distinguished from the other scales with either the adjective suffix [...] "Kelvin" [...] ("degree Kelvin") or with [...] "absolute" [...] ("degree absolute") and its symbol was °K. The latter term (degree absolute), which was the unit's official name from 1948 until 1954, was ambiguous since {{it could also be}} interpreted as referring to the Rankine scale. Before the 13th CGPM, the plural form was [...] "degrees absolute". The 13th CGPM changed <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> to simply [...] "kelvin" [...] (symbol: K). The omission of [...] "degree" [...] indicates that it is not relative to an arbitrary reference point like the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales (although the Rankine scale continued to use [...] "degree Rankine"), but rather an absolute unit of measure which can be manipulated algebraically (e.g. multiplied by two to indicate twice the amount of [...] "mean energy" [...] available among elementary degrees of freedom of the system).|$|E

5000|$|The {{military}} colours of <b>the</b> Moldavian Army <b>units</b> {{consists of}} <b>the</b> state flag, measuring 825×1650 mm, with golden fringes and tassels, having <b>the</b> <b>unit's</b> battle cry inscribed on obverse, above the coat of arms, and <b>the</b> <b>unit's</b> <b>name</b> on reverse, below the coat of arms. The flag is fixed {{on a wooden}} rod, measuring 2500 mm, with a standard pole on top. Previous regulation, which hasn't been explicitly repealed in 2010, described the inscriptions on the flag as follows: on obverse, above the coat of arms, [...] "PENTRU PATRIA NOASTRĂ" [...] (For our Motherland), and below [...] "REPUBLICA MOLDOVA" [...] (Republic of Moldova); on reverse, above the coat of arms, <b>the</b> <b>unit's</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The degree Celsius is {{a special}} name for the kelvin for use in expressing Celsius temperatures. The degree Celsius is also {{subject to the same}} rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol. Thus, besides expressing {{specific}} temperatures along its scale (e.g. [...] "Gallium melts at 29.7646°C" [...] and [...] "The temperature outside is 23 degrees Celsius"), the degree Celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature intervals: differences between temperatures or their uncertainties (e.g. [...] "The output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees Celsius", and [...] "Our standard uncertainty is ±3°C"). Because of this dual usage, one must not rely upon <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval; it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval. This is sometimes solved by using the symbol °C (pronounced [...] "degrees Celsius") for a temperature, and C° (pronounced [...] "Celsius degrees") for a temperature interval, although this usage is non-standard.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet Navy colours had the 1935 {{official}} {{design with}} them (it was later revised in 1950), with additions for units honoured with the Order of the Red Banner, but in 1964 the Supreme Commander's and Defence Minister's own naval colour and the colours of the Navy Commander-in-Chief [...] (formerly the Minister for the Navy) and Chief of Naval Operations were issued with different designs used, {{with the addition}} of the Armed Forces General Staff's own naval colour. The first colour was red with the USSR state arms, the next two had the arms with blue stripes indicating office rank, and the final two were adaptations of the naval ensign (with a different ensign with the rank) plus the stripes. The 1935 design (that of a white field with a blue lower stripe and the red star plus the hammer and sickle above the blue stripe) replaced a much earlier, post-revolutionary naval colours design adopted in 1925. In 1944 a different flag was issued to the Navy for its land based units – the same design used by the Army with a different obverse having <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> below the naval ensign.|$|E
2500|$|The current working {{uniform of}} the Coast Guard is the Operational Dress Uniform (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round {{primarily}} as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU {{is similar to the}} Battle Dress Uniform of other armed services, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn tucked in. The second generation ODU is worn untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the left shirt pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with [...] "U.S. Coast Guard." [...] Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the U.S. Public Health Service and the NOAA Corps to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular Navy Working Uniform Type I.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding <b>the</b> <b>unit's</b> <b>name,</b> Houseman later wrote, [...] "the word 'black' was taboo. 'Negro' was in {{official}} and general use {{though there was}} some ideological disagreement {{as to whether it}} should be spelled with a small or a capital N." ...|$|R
50|$|Although Nystrom did not {{propose a}} {{language}} for tonal fractions, his nomenclature for units of measure does provide one: {{the name of}} a power of sixteen before <b>the</b> base <b>unit's</b> <b>name</b> multiplies it by that number, but a power of sixteen after <b>the</b> base <b>unit's</b> <b>name</b> divides it by that number.
