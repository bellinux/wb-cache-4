Television New Zealand listed Bree, alongside sister Brooke (Beth Allen), as some of the soap's most memorable [...] "bad girls". Bree's introduction to the soap was named as a conclusion to a drama filled year for Brooke. Louise Wallace predicted the scenes where her character Annette Freeman, was held captive by Bree, would captivate the audience, she stated: [...] "It’s great stuff ... I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a few water cooler moments when people say, ‘Hey, did you see Shorty last night?’" [...] Television blogger Chris Philpot disliked the character of Bree and jokingly offered to sacrifice his least favoured characters – Harry Warner and Daniel Potts, in order for her to leave. The storyline that saw Bree lose her mind has been named as one of the show's most [...] "dramatic breakdowns".|$|E

Public opinion is, however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|R

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} shown that people travel much more {{nowadays}} than ever before. Since the Internet and the e-commerce have been developed the ability to book trips online has been enabled. There are now two dominant ways of buying trips, online or offline. The survival of traditional travel agencies has been questioned and some <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no need for them in the future. Therefore {{it would be interesting to}} see who books trips at traditional and online travel agencies.   Purpose: The purpose with this study is to understand which segments that are purchasing travels at traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies by examine demographic, psychographic and behaviouristic segmentation in the region of Jönköping. Further, in the region of Jönköping, examine advantages and disadvantages of buying trips at an online versus offline travel agency.   Method: In order to fulfil the purpose and answer the research questions the authors will use a quantitative method. The quantitative data will be gathered through a questionnaire after pilot studies have been conducted. SPSS 19. 0 will be used in order to analyse the data from the questionnaires.   Conclusion: The segment of traditional travel agencies is older people with high income while the segment of online travel agencies is younger people with lower income. Advantages of traditional travel agencies are their ability to provide service, customize a trip and give expert advice. Online travel agencies have its availability, price comparison service and comfortable way to buying trips as their advantages...|$|R

In {{the first part of}} the analysis I would like to look closer on the language culture in Právo by comparing language culture in the years 1990 and 2014. This gives me overview of the language evolution. For more accurate analysis of the language culture I will go through every year of the newspaper. In the second part of the analysis I would like to focus on the incorporation of foreign words into Czech language in Právo. I will be analysing the same period as in the previous section. I selected this period on purpose because I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> after 1989 <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be more and more foreign words coming into Czech language. I also suppose that the number of incorporated words will stop rising and keep at some level after some time. I would like to focus on the number of incorporated words and what foreign languages are used for the incorporationn the most...|$|R

[...] Harvard astrophysicist Eric Chaisson writes that Swimme, a mathematician by training, seeks a larger, warmer, more noble science story. Our story is not merely a collection of facts; science should be a student’s guide to a grand world view, including, if possible, meaning, purpose and value. He sees the cosmological perspective as one to which all modern scientists can subscribe, yet the meaning and purpose of its being a subjective outgrowth of an individual’s reflections upon that cosmology remains.In a 2007 interview with Robert Wright, Swimme says... if you take Buddhism and Christianity and so forth there's a kind of battle — a subtle sort of struggle taking place because they're not standing in a common ground but... take the Earth or ecology then suddenly they can begin to explore what they have to offer. So I do <b>think</b> absolutely <b>that...</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a flourishing of religions, not a withering away. And they will flourish to the degree that they will move into the context of planet and universe.Pacific Sun magazine reports that Swimme is at the forefront of a new movement that integrates science and spirituality. Swimme believes there is a new story, the Epic of Evolution, a cosmological narrative that begins with the Big Bang, which started the whole process, and proceeds to the evolution of the universe and life on earth. This manner of study, which engages heart and mind together, seems to teeter on the brink of religion. He believes that science, holistically, has a soul-shaking impact on people. Big history science is filled with little mysterious coincidences, upon which our entire existence rests. Swimme notes that this inspires awe and humility, and that this cosmology puts people in their proper place. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the popular view is that the earth is like a gravel pit or a hardware store, that the earth is just stuff to be used. He believes that consumerism has become the dominant world faith, exploiting the riches of the earth. His fundamental aim is to present a new cosmology - one grounded in a contemporary understanding of the universe but nourished by ancient spiritual convictions that help give it meaning.|$|R
