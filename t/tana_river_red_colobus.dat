50|$|The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus tephrosceles) is an {{endangered}} species of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey, recognised as a distinct species since 2001. There is disagreement however over taxonomy with many considering the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> to be a subspecies (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles). The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is an Old World monkey which is found in 5 different locations across Uganda and Tanzania.|$|R
50|$|The Uzungwa <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus gordonorum), {{also known}} as the Udzungwa <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> or Iringa <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to {{riverine}} and montane forest in the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{is located}} {{only on a}} very small section of the world. Its current endangerment is caused by habitat loss and {{persecution}} by humans. Tropical forests are constantly being cut down, causing the destruction of habitat for the red colobus. Cultivation {{of the land and}} the creation of levees and dykes have had the most devastating impact. Both human creations involve partial or complete forest clearing resulting in further devastation of forest patches. Both the <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> and the Tana River mangabey have been put in a dangerous situation due to deforestation and destruction created by an increasing human population. Forest is vacant primarily for agriculture; in the last 20 years approximately 50% of the unique forest has been lost. A survey conducted in 1987 concluded that since 1975 there has been approximately an 80% decline in the numbers of Tana River Colobus monkeys. Habitat disturbances, changing farming practices, and the altering course of the river were found to be the main reasons for endangerment. Another developing threat to the <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Colobus</b> is the introduction of parasitic diseases to their habitats. The presence of parasites in the monkeys was noticeably higher than other primates.|$|E
50|$|This {{diversity}} in habitats permits diverse hydrological functions and a rich bio{{diversity in}}cluding coastal and marine prawns, shrimps, bivalves and fish, five species of threatened marine turtles and IUCN red-listed African elephant (Loxodonta africana), Tana River mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus), <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus rufomitratus) and White-collared Monkey (Cercopithecus mitis albotorquatus). Over 600 plant {{species have been}} identified, including the endangered Cynometra lukei and Gonatopus marattioides.|$|E
50|$|The Tana River mangabey {{is found}} on the {{continent}} of Africa in the southeastern portion of Kenya along the Tana River. It is found within 27 forest fragments along a 60 km stretch of floodplain forests. The gallery forest along the Tana River is home to several primate species: the Tana River mangabey, <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> blue monkey, yellow baboon, vervet monkey, and two species of bush babies.|$|E
50|$|The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has {{two main}} predators: the common {{chimpanzee}} and the crowned eagle. There are many primate species in Kibale National Park but chimpanzees rarely hunt any species {{other than the}} Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Each year in Ngogo, part of Kibale National Park, up to 12% of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population is killed by chimpanzees. Chimpanzees do not hunt Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> all year round, instead they tend to go through bouts of heavy hunting. In response to attacks by a chimpanzee, all members of a Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group gather together and males assemble to aggressively try and deter the attacking chimpanzee.|$|R
50|$|The Udzungwa Mountains {{are covered}} with {{tropical}} rainforest, mountain forest, miombo woodland, grassland, and steppe. They are home to many large mammals, including the Udzungwa <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> and <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> mangabey, and unusual animals such as the grey-faced sengi. The area has extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species). They rise to 2579 m at Luhombero, and 10 {{percent of them are}} protected by the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and the Udzungwa Scarp Forest Reserve. The Udzungwa forest partridge (Xenoperdix udzungwensis) is an endemic species, found only on the Rubeho Mountains and Udzungwa Mountains, with its closest relatives appearing to be the hill partridges of Asia.|$|R

The endangered primates inhabit sixteen patches of forest (ranging from [...]1 to 6.25 km2) which extends for 60 km down the meandering lower Tana River, between Nkanjonja and Mitapani.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has a {{polygynous}} {{mating system}} especially when only one male is present. The dominance hierarchy typically determines which individuals {{are allowed to}} mate. Little {{is known about the}} reproductive cycle in the wild due to this species constant migration. The dominant male usually mates with females within the same social group. Females initiate mating through courtship displays and copulation calls. Red colobus monkeys breed throughout the year, and have a gestation period of about 4.5 to 5.5 months.|$|E
50|$|It is {{endemic to}} {{riverine}} forest patches along the lower Tana River in southeastern Kenya. It {{is threatened by}} habitat loss and degradation, which has increased in recent years. This species was, together with the equally endangered <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> {{the main reason for}} the creation of the Tana River Primate Reserve in 1978, but human encroachment within this reserve continues. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} 20,000 hectares of the Tana River Delta should be transformed into sugarcane plantations, but this has, temporarily at least, been stopped by the High Court of Kenya.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In this 3 -year {{investigation}} we documented {{patterns of}} density, diet, and activity of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Procolobus tephrosceles) in six areas {{in or near}} Kibale National Park, Uganda and related these patterns to availability of food resources. There were large differences in the density and behavior of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> among the sites. For example, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> at one site with a diverse plant community of more than 61 tree species, had a diet that included at least 42 species. In contrast, at a second site <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent 92 % of their feeding time eating from one species that dominated the tree community. The density of important <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> food trees varied among sites from 32 trees/ha to 204 trees/ha, and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density ranged from 0. 70 groups/km 2 to 7. 41 groups/km 2. Among sites, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density {{was related to the}} cumulative DBH of important food trees, when one apparently anom-alous site was excluded, and populations with more plant species in their diets tended to be those that were found at higher densities. Activity budgets of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations varied markedly among sites. For example, feeding time ranged among sites from 29 to 55 %, and traveling varied from 5 to 20 %. When faced with increased foraging demands, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> reduced the time spent resting, while the time spent socializing remained fairly constant. Comparative socioecological studies typically contrast species epa-rated by large geographical distances to ensure there is sufficient variation in the environment to detect behavioral responses. The marked ifferences in ecological conditions and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> behavior we docu-mented over short geographical distances, uggests that small-scale contrasts are a useful tool to examine ecological determinants of behavior and community structure...|$|R
50|$|Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Piliocolobus badius waldronae) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> native to West Africa. It has not been officially sighted since 1978 and was considered extinct in 2000. However, new evidence suggests that {{a very small number}} of these monkeys may be living in the southeast corner of Côte d'Ivoire. The IUCN Red List notes Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as critically endangered.|$|R
50|$|Pennant's colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1838 by George Robert Waterhouse, {{curator at the}} Zoological Society of London's museum, and was named in honour of the naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant.Three subspecies of this <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> are traditionally recognized: The Bioko <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii pennantii), the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii epieni) and Bouvier's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii bouvieri). However, Groves (2007) raised P. p. epieni, and P. p. bouvieri to Piliocolobus epieni and Piliocolobus bouvieri, respectively (this nomenclature has been followed here). Ting agreed that preliminary genetic evidence supported elevating P. epieni at least.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey {{gets its}} name from where it resides, along forests along the {{floodplain}} in the lower Tana River in eastern Kenya, the country's longest river. The river is roughly 1,000 km long. When the river in a flood, the floodplain measures from one to six km in width, and about 60 to 100 m in width when not in a flood. Floods occur roughly once a year, with a major flood occurring every three years. Although the floodplain is mostly grassy, there are places where bushland, woodland, and forests reside.|$|E
50|$|The main {{vegetation}} {{that appears}} along the lower Tana River includes grassland, wooded grassland, bushland, deciduous woodland and lowland evergreen forest. Due to human disturbances {{as well as}} floods, patchy distributions of forests have resulted. There was also a study in 1988 to determine what was causing the drastic decline of the Crested Mangabey and the <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Colobus.</b> The forest {{was found to be}} regenerating and causing a new kind of vegetation to appeal to newer species. This could have been a cause in their drop of numbers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{had been}} {{considered}} one of The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates. It was, together with the equally endangered Tana River mangabey, {{the main reason for}} the creation of the Tana River Primate Reserve in 1978, but human encroachment within this reserve continues. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} 20,000 hectares of the Tana River Delta should be transformed into sugarcane plantations, but this has, temporarily at least, been stopped by the High Court of Kenya. Contra Groves, it was not recognized as a species separate from the Ugandan, Central African and Thollon's red colobus in the 2008 IUCN Red List. With these as subspecies, P. rufomitratus is considered to be of least concern in the 2008 IUCN Red List, while P. (r.) rufomitratus is considered endangered.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys, including the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here). [...] However, other authors consider Piliocolobus to be a subgenus of Procolobus.|$|R
50|$|According to sources, Kirk first drew zoologists' {{attention}} to the Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> which is also commonly known as Kirk's <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> This species, Procolobus kirkii, which is endemic to Zanzibar, is named after him.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius), {{also known}} as the rust <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of Old World monkey found in West African forests from Senegal to Ghana. All other species of red colobuses have {{formerly}} been considered subspecies of P. badius. It is often hunted by the common chimpanzee. In 1994, western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys infected many chimpanzees with Ebola virus when they were hunted and eaten by the chimpanzees.|$|R

In 1974 she teamed up with Colin Groves in the Tana River floodplain where they studied the endangered <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> and the Tana River mangabey. In 1978 she married ornithologist Lester L. Short. As research associate and later senior research fellow in the National Museums of Kenya {{she and her husband}} took part in an ornithological project which lasted from 1985 to 1999. They studied the behaviour of the honeyguides on the Ol Ari Nyiro estate in Laikipia, Kenya and compiled an ornithological list of all birds recorded on the Ol Ari Nyiro estate. She was also among the team who rediscovered the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker for a short time in 1986/87. Jennifer Horne was a member of BirdLife International. Together with Lester L.

40|$|This {{study is}} based in Tana River National Primate Reserve (TRNPR), Kenya. The reserve, {{established}} in 1976 to protect remnant patches of riverine forests from increasing human pressure is home to two endemic endangered primate subspecies, <b>Tana</b> <b>River</b> <b>Red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Colobus badius rufomitratus) and Tana River Crested mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus galeritus). Habitat encroachment through indigenous farming and forest uses {{was thought to be}} one of the causes of drastic colobus and mangabey population decline after 1975. This study aimed at; generating information on the impact of these human land-uses on the habitat, this would facilitate the preparation of management recommendations which would improve the chances of survival of primate habitats without compromising the welfare of indigenous people. Using 3 sets of aerial photographs and a geographic information system, information on land-use changes over time has been generated. A 3 month field work generated information on agriculture, forest uses and other relevant socio-economic information. Results from the study indicate that: (i) human population has increased by more than two-folds between 1969 and 1991; (ii) this has not corresponded to a net increase in forest area decrease or farm area increase; (iii) there has been a net increase in area under forest and decrease in area under agriculture; (iv) spatial and temporal changes in forest area explain colobus population crash observed between 1975 and 1985, (v) indigenous farmers interviewed prefer a compromise, where they are allowed controlled access to land within the reserve. They showed a keen knowledge of conservation costs and benefits and cause-effect processes between humans and the environment. Management recommendations advocate measures that encourage indigenous people to be partners in conservation...|$|E
50|$|It is {{not certain}} why the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> forms these {{associations}} with other species but protection from predators is the most accepted reason. The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is less vigilant, looking out for predators less often, when associated with the red-tailed monkey. It also forms these associations more readily when there are {{a large number of}} young in the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group which implies it may be more protected when with the other species.|$|R
40|$|Chimpanzees across Africa {{include some}} meat in their diet 1.

40|$|Primate {{gastrointestinal}} microbial {{communities are}} becoming increasingly appreciated for their relevance to comparative medicine and conservation, but the factors that structure primate “microbiomes ” remain controversial. This study examined a community of primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to assess {{the relative importance of}} host species and location in structuring gastrointestinal microbiomes. Fecal samples were collected from primates in intact forest and from primates in highly disturbed forest fragments. People and livestock living nearby were also included, as was a geographically distant population of related <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> in Kenya. A culture‐free microbial community fingerprinting technique was used to analyze fecal microbiomes from 124 individual <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus), 100 individual black‐and‐white colobus (Colobus guereza), 111 individual red‐tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius), 578 human volunteers, and 364 domestic animals, including cattle (Bos indicus and B. indicusB. taurus crosses), goats (Caprus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and pigs (Sus scrofa). Microbiomes sorted strongly by host species, and forest fragmentation did not alter this pattern. Microbiomes of Kenyan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> sorted distinctly from microbiomes of Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> but microbiomes from these two <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations clustered more closely with each other than with any other species.

50|$|Another {{remarkable}} behavior {{occurs when}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys reach their restless and somewhat nomadic adolescence. This period {{is when the}} young monkeys leave their natal troops and look for another troop to join. This is not easy, as most troops are very suspicious and can get deadly when new monkeys try to join. The <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys have adapted their behavior by joining troops of green monkeys that are near the potential <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> troops that they wish to join, and living amongst {{them in order to}} spy on their potential new families. In one notable case, an adolescent male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent two years with a green monkey troop in order to spy in safety on a prospective troop in this manner.|$|R
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{is potentially}} confusing. Procolobus foai has, together {{with all other}} red colobuses, been considered a subspecies of Procolobus badius.

Additionally, the taxon tephrosceles has been considered a subspecies of the Central African <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> but following Groves (2001) it is here recognized as a separate species, the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} the Central African <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus.
