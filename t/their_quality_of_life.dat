40|$|Aim.

We also assessed the parents’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> child’s <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Methods. The DISABKIDS Chronic generic measure, short versions for both children and parents, was used on 160 families with celiac disease. A paediatric gastroenterologist classified manifestations of the disease at onset retrospectively. Results. Age or sex did not influence the outcome. Children diagnosed {{before the age of}} five scored higher than children diagnosed later. Children diagnosed more than eight years ago scored higher than more recently diagnosed children, and children who had the classical symptoms of the disease at onset scored higher than those who had atypical symptoms or were asymptomatic. The parents valuated <b>their</b> children’s <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> as lower than the children did. Conclusion. Health-related <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in treated celiac {{children and adolescents}} was influenced by age at diagnosis, disease severity at onset, and years on gluten-free diet. The disagreement between child-parent valuations highlights the importance of letting the children themselves be heard about <b>their</b> perceived <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life...</b>|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

It aims to test {{the relationships between the}} employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> and; <b>their</b> perceptions of the degree of participation in decisionmaking available to them, their perceptions of their level of job satisfaction, their perceptions of their level of affective, continuance, and normative commitment, and the ownership form of the company. It uses a sample of 1270 employees in three different ownership forms; public, private, and multinational pharmaceutical companies in Egypt. The total sample size is proportionately distributed (i. e. the actual 'sample size has been distributed between the three ownership forms based on the percentage of employees in each ownership form to the total size of the population) among', the three, forms Of ownership (public companies 889, private companies = 165, and multinational companies = 216 employee). The number of employees surveyed in each company has also been proportionately distributed. The perceptions of the targeted employees are surveyed using a questionnaire that contains 81 items. The collected data are analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programme. The findings of the study indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between the employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> and; <b>their</b> perceptions of the degree of participation in decision-making available to them, and their perceptions of their level of job satisfaction. A significant positive and partial relationship is found between the employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> and <b>their</b> perceptions of III their level of affective, continuance, and normative commitment, as it is expected, by the researcher, that the employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> may positively affect their perceptions of their level of affective, continuance, and normative commitment through affecting their perceptions of their level of job satisfaction. A significant relationship is found between the employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> and the ownership form of the company. The results also indicate that employees perceive <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> to be greater or better in the multinational pharmaceutical companies than are the employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> in both the private and public pharmaceutical companies in Egypt. Furthermore, the results indicate that the employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> in the private phan-naceutical companies are better than the employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> in the public phan-naceutical companies in Egypt. A set <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> criteria that seems important to employees in the pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, and which might therefore be productively addressed by employers/organisations has been identified. In addition, some implications for HR practices in Egypt have been raised and discussed. Finally, a set of models that could clarify the interactive relationship between the variables that have been investigated in this research in the Egyptian context has been developed. It is suggested that the set <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> criteria as well as the models might fon-n the basis for future researches of this type...|$|R
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the {{disorder}} has on <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This being the case, adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance.

25|$|DSPD {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1981 by Elliot D. Weitzman {{and others at}} Montefiore Medical Center. It is responsible for 7–10% of patient complaints of chronic insomnia. However, since many doctors are unfamiliar with the condition, it often goes untreated or is treated inappropriately; DSPD is often misdiagnosed as primary insomnia or as a psychiatric condition. DSPD can be treated or helped in some cases by careful daily sleep practices, morning light therapy, evening dark therapy, earlier exercise and meal times, and medications such as melatonin and modafinil; the former is a natural neurohormone {{partly responsible for the}} human body clock. At its most severe and inflexible, DSPD is a disability. A chief difficulty of treating DSPD is in maintaining an earlier schedule after it has been established, as the patient's body has a strong tendency to reset the sleeping schedule to its intrinsic late times. People with DSPD may improve <b>their</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> by choosing careers that allow late sleeping times, rather than forcing themselves to follow a conventional 9-to-5 work schedule.|$|E
