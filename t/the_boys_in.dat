5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> Red {{accident}} was a January 12, 2008 collision {{just outside the}} city of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, between a semi-trailer truck and a van carrying the basketball team from Bathurst High School. The accident killed seven students and {{the wife of the}} coach, and injured four other occupants in the van. It was the deadliest transportation accident in New Brunswick since 1989, when a logging truck tipped onto a hayride in Cormier Village, killing 13.|$|E

5|$|The series follows two half-brothers, Wirt and Greg (voiced by Elijah Wood and Collin Dean respectively), {{who become}} {{lost in a}} strange forest called the Unknown. In order {{to find their way}} home, the two must travel across the {{seemingly}} supernatural forest with the occasional help of the wandering, mysterious and elderly Woodsman (Christopher Lloyd) and Beatrice (Melanie Lynskey), an irritable bluebird who travels with <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> order to find a woman called Adelaide, who can supposedly undo the curse on Beatrice and her family and show the half-brothers the way home.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Summer Term each year, Rhetoric boys issue a challenge, {{written in}} Latin, to <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> preparatory at Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall, {{inviting}} them to compete in a cricket match. Preparatory respond in turn, also in Latin. The Rhetoricians take part wearing fancy dress, and are traditionally defeated by preparatory. In 2003, the tradition was adopted by the girls who issued a Latin challenge to preparatory girls inviting them to compete at rounders.|$|E

5|$|A {{school day}} at the orphanage would start at 6:00a.m. with many morning chores to be completed, predominately cleaning. A mass would be held at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. Boys at the orphanage would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> all classes of agriculture. This was so the boys were well educated and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers {{when they left the}} orphanage.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of}} a movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E
5|$|Football is {{a popular}} {{participatory}} sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer Joe Tomlin started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned. The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, {{who had just been}} hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> the league. In his honor, the league was renamed the Pop Warner Conference.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> the choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived {{the idea of a}} school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. <b>The</b> <b>Boys,</b> <b>in</b> a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{is known}} about his origin, but he first appears in the cathedral of Chartres as a boy singer in 1462. He became choirmaster of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> the Chartres choir school in 1469, which makes a birthdate of 1450 a fair approximation. In 1472 he became a canon. Between March and November 1483 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, being {{replaced}} in his duties at Chartres by the young Antoine Brumel (this is the earliest mention of this renowned composer). The following year Mureau made another pilgrimage, this one to Santiago de Compostela.|$|E
25|$|There are {{accounts}} of protection {{offered to the}} minorities by their fellow citizens that were successful in fending off the mob. The most organized team rallied behind air force captain Reşat Mater. Mater happened to be off duty and visiting his home in Cevizli's Muhasebeciler Street, which was {{right next to the}} rally point, İstanbul Caddesi. Mater first hid some of his neighbors in his house, then he took to the street with his gun and his uniform. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> the neighborhood joined him, bringing domestic implements as substitute weapons.

25|$|The present Cathedral Choir {{consists}} of 16 choristers and 6 lay clerks. The choristers were originally educated at the Cathedral's Choir School {{but this was}} closed in 1935 and the boys are drawn from local schools. There is now also of 16 girl choristers, who alternate with <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> singing three services a week, with Evensong sung daily except Saturday, and Choral Eucharist at 10.30 on Sunday. The boys and girls are aged from 8–13 years and are recruited from local schools. They are selected at voice trials held during the year and receive a thorough musical training. They are awarded an annual bursary and pocket money.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of his mother, Gregory was placed in the care of his father's friend, Margaret Vernon, Prioress of Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. At that time it was not unusual for gentlemen to place their young {{children}} in the care of nuns. As a rule <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> nunneries were very young as it was not considered appropriate for them to stay with the nuns later than their ninth or tenth year. The nuns were permitted to educate only the girls. It was acceptable for young boys, up to the age of nine or ten, to be supervised by nuns, but not taught by them, and so they were usually accompanied by a male tutor.|$|E
25|$|The police {{set up a}} {{makeshift}} incident room in a former police station on Gordon Street and began talking to local people about the fire and the family. They were surprised and shocked by a rather casual response from the neighbourhood regarding the brothers, despite {{the severity of the}} fire which led to their deaths. The indifference of the neighbourhood came to a climax at the joint funeral for <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> January 1980 when a grief-stricken Edith Hastie issued an outburst to the gathering crowd over their lack of sympathy for the loss of her sons. The two boys were buried together in one grave at the Northern Cemetery in Hull.|$|E
