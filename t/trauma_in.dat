5|$|Complicating the picture, Reagan {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} head <b>trauma</b> <b>in</b> July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia. Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate {{is estimated to}} be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing <b>trauma</b> <b>in</b> societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E
5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved <b>trauma</b> <b>in</b> their life prior to the loss.|$|E

Students’ medical records were analyzed in the research. Results: with every year of study in university the quantity of <b>traumas</b> decreased. <b>In</b> 1 st year students we found 10 <b>traumas,</b> <b>in</b> 4 th year - 5. Ligament sprains are the most frequent kinds of <b>traumas.</b> <b>In</b> total we found 33. 3 %. Their main part covers ankle joint traumas. The reasons of them are bursts, stops, changes of movements’ direction. Rather frequents (30 %) are maims of knee and elbow joints, caused by falling down. The degree of joints’ injury is, as usually, negligible. The highest quantity of moderate and heavy traumas was among 1 st year students (9 from 10) and 2 nd year students (8 from 8). Conclusions: prophylaxis complex for prevention of volleyball traumas has been offered. Volleyball traumas’ prevention implies improvement methodic and technique of students-volleyball players’ training. The main reasons of traumatism are the following: non observation of sports training principles; poor organizational and logistical support of training process...|$|R
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} <b>trauma.</b> <b>In</b> 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged.

It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of <b>trauma.</b> <b>In</b> South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E

5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior <b>trauma</b> <b>in</b> her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head <b>trauma</b> <b>in</b> the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E

Arisa awakens from her coma, but pretends to have amnesia and returns to Midori's side. She reveals {{that she was the}} original King: although she granted harmless wishes in the beginning, she eventually stole the answers to an exam for Mariko's wish, fearing disappointment if she refused. Midori caught her in the act, and she shared the task of granting the class's wishes with him, until he injured her mother, in an attempt to grant her wish. Midori then replaced her as King, using violence and bullying to grant wishes. Horrified by his cruelty and the perceived similarities between them, she then reached out to her twin, hoping that Tsubasa would be able to uncover the truth. Tsubasa learns that Midori suffered psychological <b>trauma</b> <b>in</b> his childhood after being abandoned by his mother and witnessing his twin, Akari, die of neglect. She later foils his attempt to kill her mother, as he hated his own mother and believed that Arisa hated hers as well. Arisa confesses that she loves him for noticing her loneliness, and he realizes that he loves her too. In the conclusion, Arisa's mother spends more time with her, and Arisa reconciles with Tsubasa.|$|E

5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of <b>trauma</b> <b>in</b> S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E

40|$|Using {{longitudinal}} data, {{the present}} study examined change in midlife neuroticism following trauma exposure. Our primary analyses included 670 participants (M(age) = 60. 55; 65. 22 % male, 99. 70 % Caucasian) who completed the NEO Personality Inventory at ages 42 and 50 and reported their lifetime exposure to traumatic events approximately 10 years later. No differences in pre- and post-trauma neuroticism scores were found among individuals who experienced all of their lifetime <b>traumas</b> <b>in</b> the interval between the personality assessments. Results were instead consistent with normative age-related declines in neuroticism throughout adulthood. Furthermore, longitudinal changes in neuroticism scores did not differ between individuals with and without histories of midlife trauma exposure. Examination of change in neuroticism following life-threatening traumas yielded a comparable pattern of results. Analysis of facet-level scores largely replicated findings from the domain scores.

40|$|Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} the issues of nursing care <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres <b>in</b> the Czech Republic. Injuries {{requiring}} complex and multidisciplinary treatment apart from surgery therapy are still more frequent nowadays. This is why trauma centres have been established in the Czech Republic. Their establishment increases demands for caring staff of non-physician fields. These increasing demands are of mental and physical character and of course demands for further education. The aim of the thesis was to find what opportunities nurses of <b>trauma</b> centres have <b>in</b> the field of further education, what are their biggest problems and how they cope with mental and physical stress in their work. The following hypotheses were set upon qualitative research {{in the form of}} unstructured interviews with nurses of trauma centres. Hypothesis 1 : Nurses working <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres prefer specialization education to tertiary education. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses working <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres cooperate with nurses from other clinical branches on provision of nursing care. Hypothesis 3 : Nurses working <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres get education not only in traumatology, but also in further clinical fields. Hypothesis 4 : Nurses working <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres cope with mental stress. Hypothesis 5 : Nurses working <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres cope with physical stress. Quantitative research in the form of questionnaires was applied on confirmation or refutation of the hypotheses. The research sample consisted of nurses working <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres <b>in</b> the Czech Republic. Upon evaluation of the results hypotheses 1, 2 and 5 were confirmed and hypotheses 3 and 4 were refuted. The research results confirm that the work of nurses <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres is hard in terms of mental and physical stress. There are still some reserves in further education of nurses not only {{on the part of the}} top managements but also on the part of the health care staff themselves. The thesis result may help in recruiting new staff to departments where the expected psychical and physical intensity might be an incentive to the care about an employee in the field of mental hygiene and improvement of interdisciplinary cooperation <b>in</b> <b>trauma</b> centres <b>in</b> the Czech Republic...|$|R
