40|$|Certification of {{sustainable}} forest management has evolved and accelerated with demand for certified forest products (CFPs) from public procurement policies and green building initiatives. The UNECE <b>Timber</b> <b>Committee</b> originally called certification a marketing tool and considered {{it to be a}} means of communication within the wood chain, as well as between the forest sector and a wider public. This chapter highlights the developments in CFPs. It differs from certification chapters of previous years in part because within the UNECE region there are now only two major international systems; thus, in the current chapter there is less emphasis on certification systems. This chapter provides the backdrop for the discussion of certification-related developments at the annual <b>Timber</b> <b>Committee</b> Market Discussions, to be held on 13 - 14 October 2009. Country market statements will be another basis for the Discussions, as countries are requested to report on certification and public-procurement policy developments...|$|E

50|$|The Gillitts Conservancy is a {{very active}} {{organisation}} who manages the Iphithi Nature Reserve {{in the middle of}} northern Gillitts. This nature reserve is a success story. Situated in a valley between two roads, it was a stand of invader species Blue Gum trees for 50 years until 2001. The residents bordering the valley organised a committee and contracted a logger to fell the Blue Gums. As the wood was valuable as <b>timber,</b> the <b>committee</b> was paid a lump sum which it used to found the nature reserve, fence off the additional entrances and pay for the laying of paths, building of viewing decks and planting of indigenous species. Today the Iphithi Nature Reserve is a 15 Hectare stand of indigenous forest, wetland and grasslands and home to many species of birds, small mammals and even a dam has been built which is populated with fish.The walks and park benches are popular with the residents and the park is quite heavily used on weekends.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2004. Timber {{forms an}} {{essential}} element of people lives especially those residing in rural areas. Most wood is used for fuel, building purpose; industrial uses include construction; mine props and paper products. Through commercialisation timber is sold and exported to different countries out of South Africa for great returns. Most of commercial plantations are located primarily in the Northeast and in KwaZulu-Natal; most timber plantations produce pine and eucalyptus trees. This case study examines the challenges of forest policy implementation on small-scale timber growers. The study was based on smallscale commercial <b>timber</b> grower <b>committees</b> and chairpersons of the mentioned committees. The study was carried out in mid September and October 2004. A quantity survey through face-to-face interviews of chairpersons of small growers committees was undertaken. Also a focus group interviews of committee members was carried out. The result showed that chairpersons and committee members do not know the Forest Act NO. 84 of 1998. The forest policy implementation poses great challenges for small growers as {{there is a lack of}} information between government and growers in the respective area of operation about forestry and how it should be sustained...|$|R

Arthur Blomfield then produced the first plans for the new cathedral - for a building in stone with a central tower and two western towers; but these were rejected because of the weight and the expense. His subsequent plans for a wooden cathedral were accepted, a design that kept many of the salient features of his first plan, such as the central tower and the Latin cross formation of nave and transepts. It was in the Gothic style of architecture, complete with flying buttresses, but it also had a tropical flavour, ensuring light and air. However, it was to be in <b>timber</b> and the <b>committee</b> emphasised that [...] "woods of the country and no others were to be used," [...] although in fact pitchpine was imported from North America for the ceiling.|$|R

40|$|Paper for {{discussion}} Comments on any section {{of it are}} very welcome 2 In t roduct ion The UNECE and FAO Team of Specialists on Forest Product Markets and Marketing identified the issue of illegal logging and illegal activities in the forestry sector as one that will influence markets in future years, and asked the author to prepare a literature review to stimulate an informed discussion at the <b>Timber</b> <b>Committee</b> session in October 2003. The issue now ranks among the international forestry community’s prime concerns. Many associate this issue only with tropical wood-producing countries and developing countries or nations whose economies {{are said to be}} “ in transition. ” However, existing literature shows that the problem extends well beyond these countries ’ boundaries and provides examples in developed nations. The pernicious effects of illegal logging and illegal activities should also prompt us {{to pay attention to the}} problem. This paper has been commented on by members of the Secretariat, but represents the personal views of the author. The author wishes to emphasize that the data or specific countries referred to in this paper were found while carrying out the literature review and are only used as examples. No discriminatio...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of {{sequential}} auction design on participant behavior from both a theoretical and an empirical viewpoint. In {{the first of the}} two analyses, three sequential auction designs are characterized and compared based on expected profitability to the participants. The optimal bid strategy is derived as well. One of the designs, the alternating design, is a new auction design and is a blend of the other two. It assumes that the ability to bid in or initiate an auction is given to each side of the market in an alternating fashion to simulate seasonal markets. The conditions for an equilibrium auction design are derived and characteristics of the equilibrium are outlined. The primary result is that the alternating auction is a viable compromise auction design when buyers and suppliers disagree on whether to hold a sequence of forward or reverse auctions. We also found the value of information on future private value for a strategic supplier in a two-period case of the alternating and reverse auction designs. The empirical work studies the cause of low aggregation of timber supply in reverse auctions of an online timber exchange. Unlike previous research results regarding timber auctions, which focus on offline public auctions held by the U. S. Forest Service, we study online private auctions between logging companies and mills. A limited survey of the online auction data revealed that the auctions were successful less than 50 % of the time. Regression analysis is used to determine which internal and external factors to the auction affect the aggregation of timber in an effort to determine the reason that so few auctions succeeded. The analysis revealed that the number of bidders, the description of the good and the volume demanded had a significant influence on the amount of timber supplied through the online auction exchange. A plausible explanation for the low aggregation is that the exchange was better suited to check the availability for custom cuts of timber and to transact standard <b>timber.</b> Ph.
