Beaulieu {{took over the}} raising of Priscilla, and was the only father she would ever know. She took his surname {{and over the next}} few years she grew up quickly, helping to care for the growing family as her stepfather's Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. In her own words, she {{described}} herself during this period as [...] "a shy, pretty little girl unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years". Priscilla later recalled that she felt uncomfortable moving so often because she never knew if she could make friends for life, or even if she would fit in with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>people</b> she met on each move.|$|E

2500|$|By far {{the most}} {{persistent}} critics of the mutual housing program—and many other defense housing programs—were residents of the host communities where the projects were being built, or being planned. The residents feared additional financial burdens to be imposed on them for expanding public facilities. They were also {{very concerned about the}} quality and background of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>people</b> moving into their community. Congress began reacting to the financial fears of potential defense housing host communities early in 1941 by passing an amendment to the Lanham Act that provided additional resources for the expansion of public facilities (i.e. schools, government offices, libraries, feeder roads, sewers, etc.) in these communities. Congress also anticipated the fears and concerns host communities would have about defense housing projects and empowered the FWA to overrule local resistance and regulations in order to expedite the provision of defense housing. [...] Residents of host communities would continue to be fearful that their new neighbors would be a lower class of people (no matter how similar to themselves they actually may have been), while also feeling resentful that others seemed to be getting a tax supported subsidy for housing when they themselves had worked [...] "long and hard" [...] to obtain their homes.|$|E
2500|$|Taiwanese {{students}} {{studying in}} Tokyo firstly restructured Enlightenment Society in 1918, later renamed <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>People</b> Society after 1920, {{and this was}} the manifestation for various upcoming political and social movements in Taiwan. Many new publications, such as [...] "Taiwanese Literature & Art" [...] (1934) and [...] "New Taiwanese Literature" [...] (1935), started shortly thereafter. These led to the onset of the vernacular movement in the society at large as the modern literary broke away from the classical forms of ancient poetry. In 1915, this group of people, led by , made an initial and large financial contribution on establishing the first middle school in Taichung for the aboriginals and Taiwanese and furthermore, they actively engaged to proclaim modernization, the cultural enlightenment and welfare of the island. They were passionate in delivering their political perspective in all sorts of forum covering lectures, seminars, concerts and plays for the population, maybe focusing on enthusiastic younger art students, being held in each season in almost every year. But shortly after, the oversea students returned to the island and they vigorously started to spread the ideas of socialist and proletarian, hence the working class necessitated changes social conditions. In the book of Wenhua xiehui de chengi yu fenlie, Zhang states that in early 1927, the association was broken up and eventually taken over by aggressive proletarian fractions. Many scholars acknowledged possible connections of this movement with the May Fourth Movement in China.|$|E

60|$|When the {{excitement}} {{had a little}} subsided; when their mighty mansions were magnificently furnished; when their bright equipages were fairly launched, and the due complement of their liveried retainers perfected; when, in short, they had imitated the aristocracy in every point in which wealth could rival blood: then <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>people</b> discovered with dismay that one thing was yet wanting, which treasure could not purchase, and which the wit of others could not supply--Manner.

Accustomed to the counting-house, the factory, or the exchange, they looked queer in saloons, and said 'Sir!' when they addressed you; and seemed stiff, and hard, and hot. Then the solecisms they committed in more formal society, oh! they were outrageous; and a leading article in an eminent journal was actually written upon the subject. I dare not write the deeds they did; but it was whispered that when they drank wine they filled their glasses to the very brim.
