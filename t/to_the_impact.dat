5|$|At {{the close}} of the Ice Age, with the loss of cold and dry {{conditions}} and the extinction of much of its prey, the Beringian wolf became extinct. The extinction of its prey has been attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of climate change, competition with other species, including humans, or a combination of both factors. Local genetic populations were replaced by others from within the same species or of the same genus. Of the North American wolves, only the ancestor of the modern North American gray wolf survived. The remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and dentition have been found in western Beringia (north-east Siberia). In 2016 a study showed that some of the wolves now living in remote corners of China and Mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28,000-year-old eastern Beringian wolf specimen.|$|E
5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although he could not see any Viet Cong positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of the Viet Cong's firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire because they knew the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E

In 2007, over 530,000 visits were made to the sites. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the castles and town walls played a more prominent part in debates surrounding Welsh identity. The use of Caernarfon in the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, for example, was challenged by Welsh nationalists such as Alun Ffred Jones. Cadw expanded the interpretation provided at the sites to give more emphasis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of the creation of the castles on the native Welsh, {{and the role of the}} Welsh princes in the events leading up to the 1282 invasion itself.|$|E

In the latter location, around a dozen people were killed, 50 were injured, and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged; heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop. Across western Pinar del Río Province, the hurricane destroyed all communication links. Further from the center, {{the capital city of}} Havana recorded southerly winds of 72mph (116km/h), as well as a minimum pressure of about 999mbar (29.50inHg). Around the country, the hurricane capsized several ships, primarily fishing vessels. The death toll in the country was estimated at around 90. In the days after the storm, Cuban President Zayas authorized about $30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in Pinar del Río.|$|E
5|$|On Bora-Bora, {{an island}} {{which had a}} {{population}} of 4,500 at the time, roughly 30% of the infrastructure was destroyed, including 309houses. Hotels were also impacted during the storm. On {{the north side of}} Bora Bora, nearly everything was destroyed, including the village of Vaitape and a local yacht club. Across Vaitape, roads were blocked by fallen trees and telecommunication lines were severed due to high winds. Sevenpeople on the island were reportedly slightly injured. In addition, the islands of Tahaa, Raiatea, and Moorea all sustained damage, though yachts in Raiatea managed to survive unscathed. In another archipelago, 700homes and various public infrastructures were at least somewhat destroyed by Osea. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> on infrastructure, banana trees were knocked down due to the winds, especially in mountain gardens.

5|$|Several islands {{within the}} Solomon Islands {{reported}} extensive property and crop damage. Within Vanautu, Anne brought heavy rains, flooding, and a storm surge. These effects damaged houses, crops, and property, especially on Ureparapara islands and the Torres Islands. Extensive damage {{was reported in}} New Caledonia after it was exposed to a prolonged period of storm force winds, with the eastern and southern coasts particularly affected. On January12, the system produced the highest daily rainfall totals since 1951 in several areas. Two people were killed after they attempted to cross a flooded river, and about 80others were injured by the cyclone.

5|$|The extinctions of Macroolithus {{and other}} eggs from Southern China {{have also had}} a history of {{different}} interpretations. In the 1990s, Chinese paleontologists, including the prominent egg specialist Zhao Zikui, observed a gradual reduction in dinosaur egg diversity during the final 200,000 to 300,000 years of the Cretaceous, with only Macroolithus ranging up to the boundary. They postulated, contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> hypothesis, that the extinction {{was the result of a}} prolonged drought that increased the concentration of trace heavy metals, which adversely affected eggshell and embryo development of the dinosaurs causing the population to gradually decline and collapse. Zhao et al. revised this hypothesis in 2002, postulating a gradual extinction of Macroolithus caused by the volcanism of the Deccan Traps. In 2004, Buck et al. disputed this interpretation, arguing that the apparent gradual extinction was an illusion caused by reworking of sediments. Zhao et al. (2009) maintained that the extinction event was gradual.|$|E
