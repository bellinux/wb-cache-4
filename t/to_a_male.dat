5|$|Long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis VII continued during the 1160s, the French king slowly becoming more vigorous in opposing Henry's increasing power in Europe. In 1160 Louis strengthened his alliances in central France with the Count of Champagne and Odo II, the Duke of Burgundy. Three {{years later the}} new Count of Flanders, Philip, concerned about Henry's growing power, openly allied himself with the French king. Louis's wife Adèle gave birth <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> heir, Philip Augustus, in 1165, and Louis was more confident of his own position than for many years previously. As a result, relations between Henry and Louis deteriorated again in the mid-1160s.|$|E

5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, the {{building}} was in use as a naval hospital when fire damaged much of the interior, but was confined to the newer additions by Barry. Scottish architect Sir Robert Lorimer was engaged to renovate the house following the First World War. When the 5th Duke died in 1963, the Earldom and the house went to his niece, the current Countess of Sutherland, while the Dukedom had to pass <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> heir and went to John Egerton, Earl of Ellesmere. Between 1965 and 1972, the house became a boarding school for boys, taking on forty boys and five teachers in its first year. Since 1973, the house and grounds have been open to the public, with private accommodation retained {{for the use of}} the Sutherland family.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession.

In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E

50|$|In many non-monogamous species, {{the benefit}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male's</b> {{reproductive}} fitness of mating with multiple females is large, whereas the benefit <b>to</b> <b>a</b> female's reproductive fitness of mating with multiple males is small or nonexistent. In these species, {{there is a}} selection pressure for whatever traits enable <b>a</b> <b>male</b> <b>to</b> have more matings. The male may therefore come to have different traits from the female.|$|R
50|$|In {{previous}} studies, nearly 80% {{of successful}} courtship flights were confined <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> territory. Because <b>a</b> preferred territory site {{is crucial in}} mating success, males are extremely aggressive in maintaining their territory. Black swallowtails have <b>a</b> 4:1 <b>male</b> biased sex ratio, and a low female mating frequency which leads to intense male-male competition.|$|R

25|$|In various species, such as {{the splendid}} fairywren, females benefit by mating with {{multiple}} males, thus producing more offspring of higher genetic quality. Females that are pair bonded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> of poor genetic quality, {{as is the case}} in inbreeding, are more likely to engage in extra-pair copulations in order to improve their reproductive success and the survivability of their offspring.|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} a motif of <b>a</b> woman needing <b>to</b> {{disguise}} herself as <b>a</b> <b>male</b> and later being transformed into <b>a</b> biological <b>male</b> by mysterious forces (mainly the gods). In the cases of Iphis and Leucippus, the woman's mother was pressured (by her husband) <b>to</b> bear <b>a</b> <b>male</b> child so the protagonist was forced <b>to</b> impersonate <b>a</b> <b>male</b> from birth. Later in life, manhood was granted through the blessing of a deity (Juno/Hera in Iphis' case and Leto in Leucippus').|$|R
25|$|Ibn Taymiyyah's name {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} derived from a female member of his family as opposed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> member, which was the normal custom at the time and still is now.

25|$|Since CAH is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease, most children with CAH {{are born to}} parents unaware of the risk and with no family history. Each child will have a 25% chance of being born with the disease. Families typically wish to minimize the degree of virilization of a girl. There is no known prenatal harm <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> fetus from CAH, so treatment can begin at birth.|$|E

50|$|Protogynous hermaphrodites {{refer to}} organisms that are born female {{and at some}} point in their {{lifespan}} change sex <b>to</b> <b>male.</b> <b>As</b> the animal ages, based on internal or external triggers, it shifts sex <b>to</b> become <b>a</b> <b>male</b> animal.

25|$|Sperm cells {{contribute}} {{approximately half}} of the nuclear genetic information to the diploid offspring (excluding, in most cases, mitochondrial DNA). In mammals, the sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm cell: a spermatozoon bearing a X chromosome will lead to a female (XX) offspring, while one bearing a Y chromosome will lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> (XY) offspring. Sperm cells were first observed by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1677.|$|E
25|$|Two more skulls {{would be}} found on 13 June: one upon {{the banks of the}} Leine River; another located close to a mill in west Hanover.

One skull had belonged <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> in his late-teens, whereas the other had belonged to a boy estimated to have been aged between 11 and 13 years old. In addition, one of these skulls also bore evidence of having been scalped.|$|E
25|$|The consul Quintus Lutatius Catulus {{was among}} {{a circle of}} poets who made short, light Hellenistic poems fashionable. One of his few {{surviving}} fragments is a poem of desire addressed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> with a Greek name. The elevation of Greek literature and art as models of expression promoted the celebration of homoeroticism as the mark of an urbane and sophisticated person. No assumptions or generalizations should be made about any effect on sexual orientation or real-life behavior among the Romans.|$|E

25|$|Some dildos are {{designed}} to be worn in a harness, sometimes called a strap-on harness or strap-on dildo, or to be worn inside, sometimes with vibrating devices attached externally. Strap-on dildos may be double-ended, in which case they are meant to be worn by users who want to experience vaginal or anal penetration while also penetrating a partner. They may also be used for anal penetration of men. If the penetration is done by a female partner <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> partner, the act is known as pegging.|$|E
