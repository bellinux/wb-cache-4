5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E

500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll {{be the first one to}} say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. [...] But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish I did." [...] At the end of the conversation, he reportedly told her [...] "he felt that someone {{was going to try to}} kill him to get a hold of his catalog and his estate" [...] and named some names she didn't want to say in the interview.|$|E
2500|$|The investigation, {{known as}} the Siegal {{committee}}, found heated debate among the staff over affirmative action hiring, as Blair is African American. Jonathan Landman, Blair's editor, told the Siegal committee he felt that Blair's being black played a large part in the younger man's initial promotion in 2001 to full-time staffer. [...] "I think race was the decisive factor in his promotion," [...] he said. [...] "I thought <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think {{now that it was}} the wrong decision." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{child of}} Russian-Jewish immigrants, Magdoff {{grew up in}} the Bronx. [...] In 1929, at age 15, Magdoff first started reading Karl Marx when he picked up a copy of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy in a used-book store. [...] "It blew my mind," [...] {{recalled}} Magdoff in 2003. [...] "His view of history was a revelation....that got me started reading about economics. [...] We were going into the Depression <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted {{to figure out what it}} all meant." [...] His interest in Marx led him to embrace socialism.|$|E
2500|$|In August {{that same}} year Muralitharan {{produces}} his career-best test match figures of 16 for 220, in the one-off test against England. In England's second innings Muralitharan bowled a marathon 54.2 overs to pick up 9 for 65 runs, the other wicket being a run out. Ben Hollioake becomes his 200th test wicket. Sri Lanka won by ten wickets, their first Test victory in England. After breaking the world record for the most test wickets in 2007, Muralitharan commented that his 1998 performance at the Oval against England, was his career highlight. He stated [...] "Everyone thought I was a good bowler <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't look back from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The EXCOMM then {{discussed}} {{the effect on}} the strategic balance of power, both political and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but McNamara disagreed. An extra 40, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. The US already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads, but the Soviet Union had only 300. McNamara concluded that the Soviets having 340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he reiterated that [...] "it made no difference.... The military balance wasn't changed. I didn't believe it <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't believe it now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Irwin {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 2000 that the greatest disappointment of his career was not at the British Open, but at the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. Irwin had led the tournament after the first three rounds, but shot a final round of 79 to finish 6th. Reflecting on his final round collapse, Irwin said: [...] "A number of factors were in play and it was very emotional. I thought it would be great to win 10 years later at the same venue and, more than anything else, my father was dying of cancer <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought it would be wonderful to give him a victory. I destroyed myself with the pressures I'd built up." ...|$|E

I mean c'mon Red Hot Chili Peppers were vaguely interesting in the late 80s, but Christ they fucking suck, they suck". Patton was asked in 2010 about the festivals and his relationship with Kiedis. Patton said [...] "It’s not worth talking about. I’ve {{no idea what it}} was about <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t know now. But I bet we’d have a warm embrace if we saw each other now." [...] In 2016, Trey Spruance reflected on the Mr. Bungle feud, stating that it was a [...] "weird and unprofessional jealous vendetta from a huge successful band towards an industry pip-squeak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell's mother, Gloria Jean Cantrell, died in 1987. His {{close friend}} Andrew Wood (of Mother Love Bone) died in 1990, leading Jerry to pen the song [...] "Would?" [...] for Alice In Chains' second album Dirt in Wood's memory. He also {{dedicated}} Alice In Chains' debut album Facelift to Wood, {{as well as}} his late mother. Speaking with Spin magazine in 1991, Cantrell confirmed that the song [...] "Sunshine" [...] from Facelift was written about his mother's death. “When I was a little kid, I'd always tell her, “I'll be famous and buy you a house and you'll never have to work again. I'll take care of you like you took care of me.’ When she passed away, it was a really sh–ty time for me. I didn't {{know how to deal with}} it <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still don't. But it gave me the impetus to do what I'm doing.” Gloria is also mentioned in the song [...] "Rooster".|$|E

2500|$|Nobilo {{was born}} in Auckland, of Croatian and Italian descent, and is the great {{grandson}} of an Italian pirate. At birth, his right leg was shorter than his left, which has caused him some back problems throughout his life. He was educated at St Peter's College in Auckland where he was persuaded to play golf by schoolmates (Chris Treen and Mark Lewis). Nobilo preferred to play Rugby League for Glenora over Rugby Union for St Peter's, which was [...] "a bone of contention" [...] with the school. [...] "I got a bit of grief because I preferred league over rugby <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was {{a bit more of}} a rebel. I used to catch the train to and from school and it took about 30–40 minutes. My mum said it drove her crazy because I missed it often and my parents were living in Glen Eden and I would end up in Henderson and they'd have to come and collect me".|$|E
2500|$|The {{animosity}} {{between the}} two bands continued with Dunn later criticizing the Chili Peppers on his personal webpage, specifically their bass player Flea, stating, [...] "Look, Flea, in all seriousness, really isn't that good. I mean c'mon Red Hot Chili Peppers were vaguely interesting in the late 80s, but Christ they fucking suck, they suck. Don't talk about it anymore". Patton was asked in 2010 about the festivals and his relationship with Kiedis. Patton said [...] "It’s not worth talking about. I’ve {{no idea what it}} was about <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t know now. But I bet we’d have a warm embrace if we saw each other now." [...] In 2016, Trey Spruance reflected on the feud, claiming that it was a [...] "weird and unprofessional jealous vendetta from a huge successful band towards an industry pip-squeak." [...] He also said that early in their career, the band were fans of the first two Red Hot Chili Peppers albums. However, Trevor Dunn disputes this, and wrote, [...] "I was way more into Fishbone and Bad Manners back in the day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{told his}} {{official}} biographer that after meeting Simpson, {{he wanted to}} become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When Jandali was found working in Sacramento, Jobs decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching to join the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that [...] "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." [...] (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs). Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that [...] "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy, and a big tipper." [...] After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that [...] "it was amazing... I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands." [...] However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because [...] "I was a wealthy man by <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it... I asked Mona not to tell him about me." [...] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked [...] "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" [...] Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, [...] "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive... he never contacted Steve." [...] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father. She would also create a fictional portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, A Regular Guy.|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
