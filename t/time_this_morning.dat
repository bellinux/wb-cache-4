5|$|There {{can be no}} more {{complaints}} of inactivity of the government. The forward march movement into Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, {{took place at the}} precise <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that I named, but in much more imposing and powerful numbers.|$|E
60|$|I've just done--yesterday with Scott, {{and took}} up the letters for the first <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> seriously.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've not {{conceived}} {{a passion}} for your friend," [...] Ralph said that evening to Isabel, [...] "though we talked some <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a beauty, isn't she?" [...] Granet assented enthusiastically. [...] "What {{she could}} touch upon fourth speed I wouldn't dare to say. We were going over sixty plenty of <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and yet one {{scarcely}} noticed it. You see, she's so beautifully hung." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it the one I saw {{advertised in}} the <b>Times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I wonder?' Mrs. Evelegh inquired in a placid voice. '"Charming {{furnished}} house on Holmesdale Common; six bedrooms, four reception-rooms; splendid views; pure air; picturesque surroundings; exceptionally situated." [...] I thought of writing about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me, both of you!" [...] {{she cried}} incoherently. [...] "Helen, you especially! You never heard {{anything}} so wonderful in your life! They weren't fishing excursions at all. There weren't any whiting. Henry was laying mines all the time, and he's blown up half the German fleet! It's all in the <b>Times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He's got a D.S.O.--Henry has--and he's a Rear-Admiral! Oh, Helen, I want to cry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{struggle}} was on. [...] "You must go with nurse. You {{may not have}} a good <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Another day you shall ride in the automobile if you are obedient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's the joke, Peter Rabbit? That's {{the second}} <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that I've {{been told that}} I was {{screaming}} last night, when all the time I was fast asleep," [...] said Sammy Jay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I've a {{shocking}} memory for names, but yours is--Mr. Horser, isn't it? I heard {{it for the}} first <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and my memory will generally carry me through four-and-twenty hours." ...|$|E
60|$|Aunt Betsey--the wickedness of this world--but I haven't <b>time</b> to moralize <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{that then}} was after your aunt last spoke to me--I mean the last <b>time</b> before <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I'm {{relieved}} to hear it. So," [...] he said, [...] "they'll do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dickey also {{appeared}} as {{himself in the}} film The Stratton Story in 1949. In the film, Dickey was scripted to take a called third strike from Jimmy Stewart's character. Dickey objected, stating [...] "I never took a third strike. I always swung", and asking the director, Sam Wood, {{to allow him to}} swing through the third strike; Wood insisted that Dickey take the third strike. After many takes, Dickey commented: [...] "I've struck out more <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> than I did throughout my entire baseball career." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen such an {{alteration}} in a man," [...] she said, [...] "in so short a <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> he amazed me. He knew the right people and did the right things--carried himself too {{like a man who}} is sure of himself. To-night he is simply a booby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR SKENE,--If you are {{disposed}} {{for a walk}} in your gardens any <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I {{would gladly}} accompany you for an hour, since keeping the house so long begins rather to hurt me, and you, who supported the other day the weight of my body, are perhaps best disposed to endure the gloom of my mind.--Yours ever, W.S.|$|E
60|$|Mel. O, my dear, I {{was just}} going to pay my devoirs to you; I had not <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> for making my court to the king, and our new prince. Well, never nation was so happy, and all that, in a young prince; and he is the kindest person in the world to me, let me die if he is not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Going on well. Evidently {{no idea of}} {{the flight}} of <b>time.</b> Asked <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> how many had been saved from the Lusitania. Was it in the papers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be expected. She seems to have {{something}} on her mind, though." ...|$|R
60|$|He was shaved (by {{himself or}} more {{socially}} by Del Snafflin) only three <b>times</b> a week. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> {{had not been}} one of the three times.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that he can {{possibly}} live for twenty-four hours," [...] she continued. [...] "I was allowed to sit with him for a short <b>time</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He is beginning to wander in his mind, to speak of his wife and a sum of money." [...] Jocelyn's fine eyebrows came a little closer together.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've had a {{very pale}} {{companion}} {{for the last four}} miles," [...] said Joseph, indulging in a shudder toned down by resignation. [...] "And to speak the truth, 'twas beginning to tell upon me. I assure ye, I ha'n't seed the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and that {{was no more than a}} dew-bit afield." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She didn't say a word, {{only she}} wanted to see you alone; but I'm {{thinking}} it's something about her brother; he was with her a long long <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and went away more like a dead man than a live one. But come, don't keep her waiting; and, whatever you do, don't stay long; every word she spakes is killing her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see, I see," [...] {{said the}} President, nodding kindly as he seated {{himself at the}} top of a long table. [...] "You die for mankind first, and then you get up and smite their oppressors. So that's all right. And now may I ask you to control your {{beautiful}} sentiments, and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table. For the first <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> something intelligent is going to be said." ...|$|E
6000|$|Feb.--. Livy dear, {{last night}} I played billiards with Mr. Rogers until 11, {{then went to}} Robert Reid's studio and had a most {{delightful}} <b>time</b> until 4 <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> No ladies were invited <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> Among the people present were-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 11 Carlton House Terrace, Jan. 14, ’75.—This great affair is [...] nearly arranged. My old colleagues all submit under protest; and I [...] {{shall be}} free. An {{article in the}} <b>Times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> is [...] undisguisedly aimed at getting rid of me; {{but it does not}} express [...] any of their feelings. We have had a morning at Granville’s; [...] Halifax, Granville, Cardwell, Hartington, Aberdare, Forster, [...] Carlingford, Stansfeld, Selborne, Goschen, Lowe, Kimberley,—in [...] short all, I think, except Argyll and Bright. There was {{argument}} [...] and exhortation, and much kindness. My letter to Granville will be [...] accompanied by a short reply from him expressing difference of [...] opinion and regret. They are afraid of being blamed by the party [...] if they seem to show indifference.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "reminiscent of early Beatles hits" [...] and as [...] "was likened to Buddy Holly, Johnny Cash and early Dylan." [...] Writing for the Sabotage Times, Joe Mardon said:It chugs along with a quick acoustic beat matched by an instantly classic vocal delivery of fast paced lyrics, recalling [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues". You know straight away that Bugg's got something and repeat the song, twice last night, a further three <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The smile returns every time.Quick research reveals that Jake Bugg, bred on one of the UK's largest council estates in Nottingham, has only just turned eighteen. It's a fact that is, quite frankly, ridiculous.He's a wordsmith in the Dylan sense of the word, painting pictures of the estate he grew up in, and the hope of getting out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must. I {{have some}} sewing {{to do for}} Dora this evening. Besides, Davy is {{probably}} breaking Marilla's heart with some new mischief by this <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> {{the first thing he}} said was, 'Where does the dark go, Anne? I want to know.' I told him it went around {{to the other side of}} the world but after breakfast he declared it didn't [...] . that it went down the well. Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today, trying to reach down to the dark." ...|$|E
60|$|October 7th.--Since Saturday last (it being now Thursday), I {{have been}} in Boston and Salem, {{and there has been}} a violent storm and rain during the whole <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> shone as bright as if it meant to make up for all the dismalness of the past days. Our brook, which in the summer was no longer a running stream, but stood in pools along its pebbly course, is now full from one grassy verge to the other, and hurries along with a murmuring rush. It will {{continue}} to swell, I suppose, and in the winter and spring it will flood all the broad meadows through which it flows.|$|E
60|$|But to resume. It is {{the first}} day of June. Ten days have passed since the pampero. When the strong back on Number Three hatch was {{repaired}} Captain West came back on the wind, hove to, and rode out the gale. Since then, in calm, and fog, and damp, and storm, we have won south until to- day we are almost abreast of the Falklands. The coast of the Argentine lies to the West, below the sea-line, and some <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> we crossed the fiftieth parallel of south latitude. Here begins the passage of Cape Horn, for so it is reckoned by the navigators--fifty south in the Atlantic to fifty south in the Pacific.|$|E

60|$|Archie emerged. For {{the first}} <b>time</b> in <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> of {{disturbing}} occurrences {{he began to}} feel that God was in his heaven and all right with the world. At last things were beginning to brighten up a bit, and life might be said to have taken on some of the aspects of a good egg. He stretched himself, for it is cramping work lying under settees, and, proceeding to the bedroom, picked up the tweed trousers again.|$|R
6000|$|... "That villain," [...] said she, and {{her finger}} pointed {{straight}} and firmly at Ramiro, [...] "put a sleeping-potion in my wine {{on the last}} night he dined with us at Pesaro, and when all thought me dead {{he came to the}} Church of San Domenico with his men to carry off my sleeping body. He would have succeeded in his fell design but that Lazzaro Biancomonte there, whom you have stayed him in the act of torturing to death, was beforehand and saved me from his clutches for a <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> at Cattolica his searching sbirri discovered me and brought me hither, where I have been for the past three hours, and where, but for your Excellency's timely arrival, I shudder to think of the indignities I might have suffered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “This {{continued}} all night, {{and some}} <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{we heard the}} brutes going down to their boats, and thanked God that they had spared our lives. Presently all became still; but after a time we saw the water rising on the floor, and the dreadful thought struck us that they had scuttled the ship and left us to perish. One of us managed, {{in spite of his}} bonds, to make his way up the companion and endeavour to open the door. He found, however, to his horror that it was fastened outside. Time after time he flung himself against it, but it would not yield. The water rose higher and higher, and we were waiting for the end when, to our delight, we heard a bump as of a boat coming alongside the vessel, then the sound of someone running along the deck and of the companion door being hurriedly opened. You know the rest. The ship was the Northumberland of Bristol.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{got down}} {{here last night}} (after a most intolerably wet journey) before seven, and found Thompson sitting by my fire. He had ordered dinner, and we ate it pleasantly enough, {{and went to bed}} in good <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning,</b> Mr. Yates, the great man {{connected}} with the Institution (and a brother of Ashton Yates's), called. I went to look at it with him. It is an enormous place, and the tickets have been selling at two and even three guineas apiece. The lecture-room, in which the celebration is held, will accommodate over thirteen hundred people. It was being fitted with gas after the manner of the ring at Astley's. I should think it an easy place to speak in, being a semicircle with seats rising one above another to the ceiling, and will have eight hundred ladies to-night, in full dress. I am rayther shaky just now, but shall pull up, I have no doubt. At dinner-time to-morrow you will receive, I hope, a facetious document hastily penned after I return to-night, telling you how it all went off.|$|E
