5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over <b>the</b> <b>clinics,</b> 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, many of these people could have been saved.|$|E

25|$|In most countries, MSF {{increases}} {{the capabilities of}} local hospitals by improving sanitation, providing equipment and drugs, and training local hospital staff.

In some countries, like Nicaragua, MSF provides public education to increase awareness of reproductive health care and venereal disease.|$|E

Missionaries worked to abolish practices such as foot binding, and the unjust treatment of maidservants, as well as launching charitable work and distributing food to the poor. They also opposed the opium trade and brought treatment to many who were addicted. Some of the early leaders of the Chinese Republic, such as Sun Yat-sen were converts to Christianity and were influenced by its teachings.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, {{to see that the}} fetus is well-positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of <b>the</b> <b>clinics.</b> Some women also did not want people to know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{constraints}} and restrictions on medicines {{have forced the}} Cuban health system to incorporate alternative and herbal solutions to healthcare issues, which can be more accessible and affordable to a broader population In the 1990s, the Cuban Ministry of Public Health officially recognized natural and traditional medicine and began its integration into the already well established Western medicine model. Examples of alternative techniques used by <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> and hospitals include: flower essence, neural and hydromineral therapies, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine (i.e. acupunctural anesthesia for surgery), natural dietary supplements, yoga, electromagnetic and laser devices. Children begin studying the multiple uses of medicinal plants in primary school, learning to grow and tend their own plots of aloe, chamomile, and mint, and later they conduct scientific studies about their uses. Radio and Television programs instruct people on how to relieve common stomach upset and headaches by pressing key points. Acupuncture is offered at all three levels of health care. Cuban biochemists have produced {{a number of new}} alternative medicines, including PPG (policosanol), a natural product derived from sugarcane wax that is effective at reducing total cholesterol and LDL levels, and Vimang, a natural product derived from the bark of mango trees.|$|E

25|$|A {{large body}} of {{international}} research has shown the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment programmes {{for the treatment of}} drug addiction and subsequent reduction in HIV risk behaviors. In acknowledgment of this evidence, in 2004 the Chinese government called for the use of such practices to mitigate HIV transmission. Immediately, under the governance of the Ministries of Health and Public Security and the State Food and Drug Administration, a pilot study of eight clinics in five provinces was done. Inclusion in the programme required: (1) several failed attempts to quit the use of heroin, (2) at least two terms in a detoxification centre, (3) age at least 20 years, (4) being a registered local resident of the area in which the clinic is located, and (5) being of good civil character. Those testing HIV positive need only fulfill criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of <b>the</b> <b>clinics,</b> a database was established to gather data on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients. These data were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and indicated reductions in heroin use, drug-related crime, and unemployment in those who received methadone maintenance treatment.|$|E

Each clinic was overseen by a physician, with three obstetricians and a lawyer on call, and offered what Reich called Sex-Pol counselling. Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Reich offered a mixture of [...] "psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives," [...] Danto writes, and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. <b>The</b> <b>clinics</b> were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help.|$|E
