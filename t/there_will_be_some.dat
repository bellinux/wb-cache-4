25|$|In 1920, while mayor, {{he wrote}} his first book, The Social Worker, which set out many of the {{principles}} that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:In a civilised community, {{although it may be}} composed of self-reliant individuals, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} layers of {{modeling}} {{are used to}} determine the long-term, or Time Independent, estimates of the magnitude, location, and frequency of potentially damaging earthquakes in California. The Time Dependent model is based on the theory of elastic rebound, that after an earthquake releases tectonic stress <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> time before sufficient stress accumulates to cause another earthquake. In theory, this should produce some regularity in the earthquakes on a given fault, and knowing the date of the last rupture is a clue to how soon the next one can be expected. In practice this is not so clear, in part because slip rates vary, and also because fault segments influence each other, so a rupture on one segment triggers rupturing on adjacent segments. One of the achievements of UCERF3 is to better handle such multifault ruptures.|$|E

500|$|The {{transfer}} function of an mm'-type {{is the same}} as an m-type with m set to the product mm. [...] To choose values of m and m for best impedance match requires the designer to choose two frequencies at which the match is to be exact, at other frequencies <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> deviation. [...] There is thus some leeway in the choice but Zobel suggests the values m=0.7230 and m=0.4134 which give a deviation of the impedance of less than 2% over the useful part of the band. [...] Since mm=0.3, this section will also have a much faster cut-off than an m-type of m=0.6 which is an alternative for impedance matching.|$|E

500|$|Rupert D'Oyly Carte {{found the}} company's {{productions}} increasingly [...] "dowdy", however, {{and on his}} return from the war, he determined to refresh them, bringing in new designers including W. Bridges-Adams for the sets, and, for the costumes, George Sheringham and Hugo Rumbold. He also commissioned new costumes from Percy Anderson {{who had worked with}} Gilbert and Richard D'Oyly Carte on the original productions of the later Savoy operas. Charles Ricketts redesigned sets and costumes for The Mikado (1926) and The Gondoliers (1929). His costumes for The Mikado were retained by all subsequent designers until 1982. [...] In an interview in The Observer in August 1919, Carte set out his policy for staging the operas: [...] "They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date."

500|$|Feige {{felt that}} the visuals of the film needed [...] "to be a Ditko/Kubrick/Miyazaki/The Matrix mind-trip", and said that [...] "You don't get into it in Harry Potter, but if a {{scientist}} went to Hogwarts he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not {{going to spend a}} lot of time on that, but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds." [...] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting [...] "to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that." [...] Feige called Doctor Strange the [...] "doorway" [...] into the supernatural side of the MCU, a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics [...] "broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse". Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' [...] "Earth-616 and Earth 617", but would instead feature [...] "dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them", like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.|$|E
500|$|The Calcutta Review starts {{by noting}} {{that this is a}} book that cannot be done justice in a brief notice, that Wallace is a most eminent naturalist, and chiefly known as a Darwinian. the book was the most {{interesting}} to cross the reviewer's desk since Palgrave's Arabia (1865) and Sir Samuel Baker's Explorations of the Nile (1866). By combining geography, geology and ethnology into one narrative, the reader is saved [...] "the monotony of traversing the same regions several times". The review describes in detail Wallace's findings of different birds and mammals either side of the Wallace line. It notes Wallace's cheerfulness and good temper in the face of [...] "the difficulties and inconveniences attendant upon foreign travel", such as having to cross [...] "a hundred miles of open sea in a little boat of four tons burthen", which Wallace calmly describes as comparatively comfortable. The reviewer remarks that Wallace was [...] "set down as a conjuror by these simple people" [...] with unimaginable purposes from a faraway country, but is less admiring about Wallace's moralising tone, especially when he supposes that [...] "wild communities" [...] can be happier than [...] "in a more highly civilised society". The review ends with some reflections of surprise on how little-known the Malay Archipelago is in India, given that they were closely connected with Hindu temples in Java and Bali, and hopes that soon <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> [...] "productions" [...] of the archipelago in the Indian Museum of Calcutta.|$|E
