5|$|The Ottoman naval {{presence}} at Beirut was completely annihilated, removing the only Turkish naval threat to Italian transports {{in the area}} and giving the Italians complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean Sea {{for the rest of the}} war. Casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy. Both Ottoman warships were sunk, with Avnillah alone taking 58 killed and 108 wounded. In contrast the Italian ships not only took no casualties, but no direct hits from the Ottoman warships as well. The damage was not restricted to the Ottoman naval vessels present at Beirut, as the city took heavy damage as well. Stray shots from the cruisers decimated the city. Fires broke out as a direct result of <b>the</b> <b>stray</b> gunfire, destroying several banks and part of the city's customs house as well as other buildings. Combined from the fires and shelling, 66 civilians were killed in the city along with hundreds of others wounded.|$|E

25|$|The A59 then {{runs along}} the head of Fewston Reservoir and follows the route of a Roman road past the 'golf balls' at Menwith Hill, an RAF station. As Skipton Road, the A59 then declines towards Harrogate passing Kettlesing. Reaching Harrogate as Skipton Road, it meets the A61 Ripon Road for Ripon, Harrogate town centre and Leeds, before {{continuing}} through the suburbs of the town as Skipton Road. This section of the A59 is widely considered {{to be one of}} the busiest roads in North Yorkshire. Part of this section travels across <b>the</b> <b>Stray,</b> an act-protected tract of grassy land which horseshoes around the town centre. The A59 then turns left at the Empress Roundabout, which is itself on <b>the</b> <b>Stray,</b> towards Starbeck, although traffic travelling towards York is directed onto the A661 Wetherby Road to utilise the A658 Harrogate and Knaresborough Southern Bypass. The A59, however, continues to travel through Starbeck as Knaresborough Road and later High Street, then heads east to Knaresborough, passing through the town centre before heading towards York as York Road.|$|E

This didn't sit well with guitarist Mark Wong See, who decided to leave the band. The four remaining members chose a new name and Johnny Dole & The Scabs was born.|$|R
25|$|In 1901, U.S. President William McKinley {{was shot}} twice in an {{assassination}} attempt.

While the shooting itself had not been lethal, gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection six days later.|$|E

Brinkley and Joel met in 1983 on the Island of St Barts, in the Caribbean and were married on March 23, 1985 on a yacht on the Hudson River, the second marriage for both. Joel, 35, and Brinkley, 31, took their vows {{in a private}} ceremony attended by 175 family members and friends, including Paul Simon and <b>the</b> <b>Stray</b> Cats.

25|$|Soon EMI {{picked them}} up, their first videos {{appeared}} on MTV, and they stormed up the charts stateside. Their third LP, Rant 'N' Rave with <b>the</b> <b>Stray</b> Cats, topped charts across the USA and Europe as they sold out shows everywhere during 1983. However, personal conflicts led the band {{to break up}} {{at the height of}} their popularity. Brian Setzer went on to solo success working in both rockabilly and swing styles, while Rocker and Phantom continued to record in bands both together and singly. The group has reconvened several times to make new records or tours and continue to attract large audiences live, although record sales have never again approached their early Eighties success.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, {{the deputy}} {{commander}} of the air force, sent two T-28 fighter-bombers over Saigon. They strafed the palace, and fired two rockets while avoiding sporadic black and white clouds of antiaircraft fire. Both shots missed their targets, and the second struck an empty US Marine barracks. The only result of <b>the</b> <b>stray</b> projectile was that {{the damage to the}} marines' lodging resulted in a pet snake escaping. At the same time, some air force fighter-bombers made strafing runs at the headquarters of the naval forces in the capital, where the defenders remained loyal to Diệm. Some anti-aircraft guns on the vessels patrolling in the Saigon River returned fire. Around 15 minutes after the start of the coup, radio transmissions were taken off the air, severing communication with those outside Saigon.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), the sum of <b>the</b> <b>stray</b> parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, {{they have the same}} resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E
