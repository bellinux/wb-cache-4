50|$|When Eric XIV, {{the son of}} Gustav Vasa, was crowned king in 1561, {{the title}} had been made {{hereditary}} and the kingdom was now financed not by income from royal properties and privileges, but by taxes. Furthermore, at this time {{the extent of the}} kingdom, because of the guarded foreign politics of Gustav Vasa largely unchanged during his rule, started to grow as the disintegrating Teutonic Order left the Baltic exposed to new ambitious powers, and Reval, as a consequence, asked for Swedish protection against Russia and Poland and became a Swedish dominion. Though Sweden could hardly present the level of government and bureaucracy prerequisite to have a capital in the modern sense, Stockholm was the kingdom's strongest bastion and the king's main residence. As Eric XIV's pretensions were in pair with those of Renaissance princes on the continent, he afforded himself a court the size his finance could possibly support, and the royal castle was thus the biggest employer in the city, more so when the king was present in person. In connection to his crowning in 1561, his taste for luxury caused the Crown to consume between two third and <b>three</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the city's import.|$|E

Ridden by Kerrin McEvoy he took the lead two furlong out and accelerated clear to win [...] "comfortably" [...] by two lengths from Scorpion. Following his win at Chester, Ask was off the course for four and a half months before returning at Ascot Racecourse on 30 September in the Group 3 Cumberland Lodge Stakes. He started the 11/4 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Honolulu who had finished third in the St Leger two weeks earlier. After being restrained by Moore in the early stages he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two lengths from Zaham, with Honolulu <b>three</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> a length away in third. Three weeks later Ask was sent to Canada to contest the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racecourse and started favourite in a twelve runner field. After being held up in the early stages and turning into the straight he produced a strong late run but failed by a short head to overhaul the American gelding Cloudy's Knight.|$|E

5000|$|On February 22, 2008, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{issued a}} report titled [...] "In Dead Water: Merging of climate change with pollution, over-harvest, and infestations in the world's fishing grounds", warning that three {{quarters}} of the world's key fishing grounds are at risk of being seriously impacted by rising temperatures. They reported potential consequences as changes in oceanic circulation patterns, currents that bring nutrients and remove waste from fisheries, rising surface temperatures that are expected to bleach and kill as much as 80% of the world's coral reefs - major tourist attractions and nurseries for many juvenile fish, and finally, the possible acidification of the ocean's waters as warmer water absorbs more atmospheric carbon emissions. Increased acidity would impact organisms that utilize calcium for shell-production. Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director, said: In Dead Water has uniquely mapped the impact of several damaging and persistent stresses on fisheries. It also lays on top of these the likely impacts of climate change from dramatic alternations in ocean circulation affecting perhaps a <b>three</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> key fishing grounds up to the emerging concern of ocean acidification... it is clear from this report and others that it will add significantly to pressures on fish stocks. This is as much a development and economic issue as it is an environmental one. Millions of people including many in developing countries derive their livelihoods from fishing while around 2.6 billion people get their protein from seafood." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the cases of Germany, France or Italy, the question of World War I aims of Hungary remains almost unexplored. However, as the Kingdom of Hungary was the most politically stable part of the Habsburg Monarchy, it strongly impacted the Dual Monarchy's war plans. The main concerns {{of the government in}} Budapest were directed by the fears for the integrity of Hungary. In July 1914, its Prime Minister, István Tisza, convinced the Monarchy's Crown Council not to demand new territories from Serbia. In parallel, the Hungarian opposition secretly informed the Entente that an independent Hungary could be proclaimed, ready to sign a separate peace treaty if her frontiers were guaranteed. An opposition leader, Mihály Károlyi, entered into contacts with Italians, British and French. In the autumn of 1915, with Austro-Hungarian army’ successes, the secessionist moods in Budapest cooled down. Hungarian politicians turned towards the annexation of Northern Serbia, and possibly Montenegro. When Austria envisaged the joining of Poland, Tisza insisted in Vienna to include Bosnia-Hercegovina (and probably Dalmatia) in Hungary. However, when Romania declared war on the Habsburg Monarchy in August 1916, the Tisza government anticipated annexations of Romanian lands, whereas the Hungarian radical opposition in the parliament (independentists, led by Mihály Károlyi), reinforced the separatist propaganda. In March 1917, Tisza proposed to the Crown Council of the Monarchy to divide Romania between Hungary and Russia, leaving a little Romanian buffer State. Yet, according to the Bucharest Peace Treaty (7 May 1918), Romania only ceded Carpathian mountain passes to Hungary. The next [...] "success" [...] of Hungarian territorial expansionism was the Habsburgs approval of the attachment of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia to the Kingdom in October 1918. Expecting the collapse of the Central Powers, Károlyi was allowed by the Imperator-King to form a government in Budapest. This government declared the independence of Hungary on 31 October 1918. However, it did not stop the Entente and its allies from raising territorial claims against Hungary. They finally acquired <b>three</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> pre-war Hungary by the Peace Treaty of Trianon (4 June 1920).|$|E
