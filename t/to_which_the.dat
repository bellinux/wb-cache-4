5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{is defined by}} its cells (often a one- or two-dimensional array), a finite set of values or states that can go into each cell, a neighborhood associating each cell with a finite set of nearby cells, and an update rule according <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> values of all cells are updated, simultaneously, {{as a function of}} the values of their neighboring cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of thought content would describe a patient's delusions, overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' thoughts in an open-ended conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the thoughts, the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> thoughts are experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{religious}} beliefs are represented among the novel's characters. Jacob Brattle is an unbeliever. Puddleham is a Primitive Methodist. The Stowte family, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> marquis belongs, are Low Church Anglicans, and Fenwick is High church and latitudinarian. Their charity is tested by {{their response to}} Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the test. As William Cadbury expresses it, Puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine, Jacob Brattle by too little.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} {{election}} to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community.

5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E
