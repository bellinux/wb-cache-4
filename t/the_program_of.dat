5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no opposition party in Poland since all political groupings had to support <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> the PZPR. As a result, no real opposition candidates were permitted to run in the elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have stripped the communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political victory would have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E
5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> <b>of</b> Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Alfonsín {{refused to}} foster {{diplomatic}} relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use of nuclear power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> <b>of</b> Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common market. This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, 1915, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} seventeenth {{biennial}} convention in Washington, D.C.. The encampment was coordinated by General Oden Lake, their national commander. There were about 25,000 visitors during this convention, {{including members of}} the Army and Navy Union. There was a suite of rooms reserved at the New Willard Hotel for encampment headquarters from June 1 to September 30. A large parade was part of September convention, which involved all the veteran organizations of the Washington area garrisons. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> events included a grand military ball and a banquet with high ranking government officials.|$|E
5|$|The decathlon was a {{relatively}} new event in modern athletics, although it {{had been part of}} American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> the 1904 St.Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he could run the 100-yard dash in 10seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8seconds; the 440 in 51.8seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24seconds. He could long jump 23ft 6in and high-jump 6ft 5in. He could pole vault 11feet; put the shot 47ft 9in; throw the javelin 163feet; and throw the discus 136feet.|$|E
5|$|The school runs on {{a shoestring}} budget as a {{tradeoff}} for its financial independence and accessibility to low-income students. Tuition is billed on a sliding scale based on what parents can afford. Revenue from rental properties and fundraising supplements tuition income. The Free School started a high school program in 2006. It later spun off as the Harriet Tubman Democratic High School and enrolls about 20 students in both self-directed and traditional classes. Alumni of the school have attended a variety of colleges. Journalists have noted the school's similarity to unschooling and homeschooling, and its work to that of prefigurative politics. The Albany Free School {{is one of the}} few schools remaining from the 1960s and 1970s free school movement. It inspired <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> the Brooklyn Free School.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} and most {{important}} naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.|$|E
5|$|Though the French {{presented}} {{themselves as}} liberators, they behaved like conquerors. After acrimonious {{negotiations between the}} representatives of the new Batavian Republic and those of the French Republic, a harsh Treaty of The Hague was concluded on 16 May 1795. Apart from imposing territorial concessions and a huge indemnity, this obligated the Dutch to maintain a French army of occupation of 25,000 men. This changed the Dutch republic from a client state of England and Prussia into a French one; henceforth it would conduct a foreign and military policy dictated by France, where its predecessor had followed British dictates since 1787 (an offensive and defensive alliance of the two republics was part of the treaty), while its economic policies would in effect also be made subservient to the interests of France. However, this did not mean that it lost its independence in all respects. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> reform that the Dutch revolutionaries attempted to put in place (however constrained by the political realities of the French revolution as this was to progress) was mostly driven by indigenous needs and aspirations. The political events in the Netherlands were mainly derived from Dutch initiative, with some notable exceptions. The French were responsible for {{at least one of the}} coups d'état, and the French ambassador often acted as a proconsul.|$|E
