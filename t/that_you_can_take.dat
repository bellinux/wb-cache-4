2500|$|The Nintendo Switch is {{a hybrid}} video game console, {{with the main}} system {{comprising}} the [...] "Switch Console", the [...] "Switch Dock", and the [...] "Joy-Con" [...] controllers. Although it is a hybrid console, Fils-Aimé stated that the Switch is [...] "a home console <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> {{with you on the}} go". Fils-Aimé said that the Switch and their primary handheld console, the Nintendo 3DS, are meant to co-exist, with Kimishima considering the 3DS an entry-level product for younger players. The company had planned to diminish production of the Wii U in anticipation of the Switch's release, and formally announced the end of its production on January 31, 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Hackford {{directed}} the film, and Steven Chasman, Hackford, Alexander, Sidney Kimmel, and Jonathan Mitchell produced. Hackford {{was excited to}} make Parker his [...] "first sort of film noir", stating: [...] "I don't want to get stuck in a genre. What I like the most about this piece of material is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a genre piece like this {{and turn it into}} a great movie." [...] Speaking with Palm Beach Daily News about what led him to Parker, Hackford stated [...] "I’m a fan of Donald Westlake. I really think he’s a fabulous writer … very unique in the area of crime because his Parker series". Hackford was attracted to Parker because he was a [...] "strange character" [...] and [...] "sociopath" [...] who, at the same time, isn't a sociopath, describing him as [...] "compelling".|$|E

6000|$|... "I will do <b>that,</b> master. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> my word <b>that</b> by {{tomorrow}} at noon the lodging {{of these four}} gentlemen will be strictly watched. This is a business after my own heart." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 9, 2013, in {{response}} to the Baseball Hall of Fame announcement in which no players were elected, Lo Duca acknowledged his steroids use, tweeting [...] "I took PEDs and I'm not proud of it..but people <b>that</b> think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a shot or a pill and play like the legends on that ballot need help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, it {{is lucky}} {{for you that}} there are a great many Sigmunds {{in this part of the}} world,' replied her father, 'so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> your choice! And what do YOU say?' he added, turning to the second.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} my wrongs are {{the talk of}} the county. But what does he care for that? He only cares for one thing in the whole world, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> from him this night. Have you a bag?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Rowan," [...] he said, [...] "don't you {{see that}} your very illness makes it absurd to imagine <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a {{position}} and save any amount of money worth mentioning in it, in twelve months? The idea is absurd." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} the Bellflower mom, Nadya Suleman's story, I spoke on The Today Show. When asked, Iyke Louis Udobi stated in their recent AP {{interview}} <b>that</b> [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> care of one, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> care of eight".|$|R
5000|$|You can't take {{a congressman}} to lunch for $25 and {{buy him a}} {{hamburger}} or a steak or something like <b>that</b> ... But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> him to a fund-raising lunch and not only buy him that steak, but give him $25,000 extra {{and call it a}} fund-raiser - and have all the same access and all the same interactions with that congressman. Jack Abramoff, commenting on 60 Minutes, according to CNN ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} will be possible, senor, to carry out the plan of trying to cross into Portugal, in this direction. It seems to me, now that Soult is engaged, and there can be no large bodies of French near Seville, our best plan would be to make for that town; whence, so far as we know, the country is clear of the enemy down to Cadiz; and when we reach <b>that</b> port, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> ship to Lisbon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Saxton, simply. [...] "I don't quite {{think it}} would. Still, I've seen {{enough to show}} me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the {{sensible}} point of view. We both want dollars, and I can't afford to be particular. I'm not sure you can, either." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{accuracy}} of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, {{to give me}} great confidence in Joe's information. [...] "And now," [...] said Joe, [...] "you ain't that strong yet, old chap, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> in more nor one additional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he's been a bustin' open a dwelling-ouse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you are {{old enough}} for that," [...] said Margaret. [...] "It {{would be hard to}} keep Flora at home, now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> her place, and do not care for going out. One of us must be the {{representative}} Miss May, you know, and keep up the civilities; and you may think yourself lucky it is not you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trick is}} {{to die in the}} jacket, to will {{yourself}} to die. I know you don't get me yet, but wait. You know how you get numb in the jacket--how your arm or your leg goes to sleep. Now <b>you</b> can't help <b>that,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> it for the idea and improve on it. Don't wait for your legs or anything to go to sleep. You lie on your back as comfortable as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get, and <b>you</b> begin to use your will.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Ussher only {{burst out}} {{laughing}} at this little outbreak, but Father John exclaimed, [...] "Whist! whist!

6000|$|It was decreed {{the next}} day that I should not leave until after dinner. They would send me over to Blackburn Station by a cross-road, and I could then reach Waterton {{in less than an}} hour. [...] "There is another good thing about this arrangement," [...] said Miss Edith, for it was she who {{announced}} it to me, [...] "and that is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> charge of Amy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} another trip or not, {{just as you}} please. Now, I think you will be very foolish, if you don't agree; for you will make {{three times as much}} as I offer you, every thirty boxes of fruit <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> in there; but the boat has got to go there now, and you have got to take your choice whether you go in her, or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Fischer," [...] he said, [...] "you've had me {{practically}} in {{your power}} for {{the best part of}} a year, but now I'm through with you. I'm out of your debt, no thanks to you, and I'm going to keep out. I am working on your business as hard as though you were my own brother, and I'll go on doing it. I'll get you out of this mess as well as I can, and after <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> your damned business where you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{could not}} have spent your time better, if you had an {{intention}} of coming over {{to take part in}} our troubles here. Your grandfather, De Moulins, was said {{to be one of the}} best swordsmen in France; and you may have inherited some of his skill. I own that I felt rather uneasy at the charge of two such young cockerels, though I could not refuse when the countess, my aunt, begged me to let you ride with me; but in future I shall feel easy about <b>you,</b> seeing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> both <b>take</b> your own parts stoutly.|$|R
6000|$|The girl’s eyes flashed, and {{she slowly}} {{straightened}} herself. “It is fortunate for <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I <b>can</b> <b>take</b> your word, because I had formed my own conclusions,” she said. “Don’t suppose I should sit here {{talking to you}} if I had thought you were guilty. This, however, is quite between ourselves.” ...|$|R
6000|$|But I will gladly {{send it to}} you if {{you will}} do as follows: dramatize it, if <b>you</b> {{perceive}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>take,</b> for your remuneration, half of the first $6000 which I receive for its representation on the stage. You could alter the plot entirely, if you chose. I could help in the work, most cheerfully, after you had arranged the plot. I have my eye upon two young girls who can play [...] "Tom" [...] and [...] "Huck." [...] I believe a good deal of a drama can be made of it. Come--can't you tackle this in the odd hours of your vacation? or later, if you prefer? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that's enough. I'm through. You did mean to insinuate I was {{out with}} men. I wasn't--but that was just accident. I'd have been glad to, if there'd been one I could have loved even a little. I'd have gone {{anywhere}} with him--done anything! And now we're through. I stood you {{as long as it}} was my job to do it. God! what jobs we women have in this chivalrous world that honors women so much!--but now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> care of yourself, I'll do the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fell in {{love with}} you when I had only known you for an hour," [...] he {{answered}} with evident sincerity. [...] "Please listen to me. I know I am not worthy of you! But I do love you so very dearly, and I would make you a good husband; indeed I would, I am well off; though, of course that is nothing; and if you don't like New Zealand, I would give it up and go to live in England. Do you think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> me? If you only knew how dearly I love you, I am sure you would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{could expect}} no better," [...] said I, [...] "but I {{think you might}} {{try to be a}} little kind to me for the last end of it. I see not why you should be harsh. I have loved you very well, Catriona--no harm that I should call you so for the last time. I have done the best that I could manage, I am trying the same still, and only vexed that I can do no better. It is a strange thing to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> any {{pleasure}} to be hard to me." ...|$|E

However, if <b>you</b> {{encounter}} winds <b>that</b> delay <b>you,</b> it <b>can</b> <b>take</b> two years. That is why all the men who go by sea take stores for three years. The vast ocean urges men to think of their country, and get homesick, and some of them die." ...|$|R

He has {{had the advantage of}} his father’s teaching, and, theoretically at any rate, he is already well up in his work. When I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a lunar, or an observation from a star, <b>you</b> may imagine <b>that</b> he will not require much teaching in navigation.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Students in Alberta {{have their}} courses {{mandated}} but normally after each section of schooling {{they are given}} more freedom in what they <b>can</b> choose to <b>take.</b> Then starting in high school most courses begin to be labeled with a dash, for example Math 20-1. Where [...] "-1" [...] is the highest level follow by [...] "-2" [...] etc. Courses are also labeled with a 10, 20, 30, {{or in some cases}} 31. Where 10 is the lowest is generally taken in grade 10 followed by 20 taken in grade 11 and so on. Although, there is no rule stating <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not <b>take</b> for example math 20-1 in grade 10 assuming you have the prerequisites.

He's about as much solid use to a girl with aspirations as a pain in the lower ribs. It's three weeks since he got me into print at all, and then the brightest thing he could think up was that my favourite breakfast-fruit was an apple. Well, I ask you!" ...|$|E

Nature has retaliated by making me also an unnaturally inferior person. Nature abhors lopsidedness. She turns out man as a whole, to be developed as a whole. I always wonder, whenever I come across a supernaturally pious, a supernaturally moral, a supernaturally cultured person, if they also have a reverse self.' ...|$|E
60|$|DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Agatha, you say {{the most}} silly things possible. I think on the whole that Grosvenor Square {{would be a more}} healthy place to reside in.
