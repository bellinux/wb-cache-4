5|$|It did {{not take}} Louis XVIII long {{to go back on}} one of his many promises. He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> accounted for 55% of government spending.|$|E
5|$|On March 11 Thieu {{convened a}} meeting with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao Văn Viên, and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the {{military}} situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw {{what was left of}} his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, where most of the nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam’s territory, so <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E

5|$|U.S. rhetoric abroad {{also had}} an effect on the Guatemalan military. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied a lot of {{pressure}} on senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.|$|E
5|$|By October, Moreno's {{measures}} {{started to}} generate resistance among some who initially supported the May Revolution. Traders {{did not like}} the protectionist policy, and some members of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment. On October 16 it was discovered that ten members of the Cabildo had sworn loyalty to the Regency Council the past July, and they were all jailed. This included Julián Leiva and Juan José de Lezica. Moreno and Saavedra had a dispute when the Junta was deciding what to do. Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent, accusing them of working with the Montevideo Cabildo, the enemy of the Junta. Saavedra replied that the government should promote leniency, and rejected the use of the Patricians Regiment to carry out such executions. The prisoners were finally exiled to Luján, Ranchos, and Salto, and Leiva was housed by Gregorio Funes in Córdoba.|$|E

Additionally, Elmi stated that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> implemented a new biometric registration system, wherein each recently trained and armed soldier is photographed and fingerprinted. By the end of 2014, 17,000 national army soldiers and police officers had registered for the new biometric remuneration system. 13,829 SNA soldiers and 5,134 Somali Police Force officials were biometrically registered in the system as of May 2015.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1926, five {{military}} officers, led by Captain Antanas Mačiuika, {{organized a}} committee. Generals Vladas Nagevičius and Jonas Bulota were among its members. About a month later, another group, the so-called Revolutionary General Headquarters (Lithuanian: revoliucinis generalinis štabas), was formed. The two groups closely coordinated their efforts. By 12 December, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> already planned detailed actions, investigated {{the areas where}} the action was to take place, and informed {{the leaders of the}} Lithuanian National Union and Christian Democratic parties. Rumors of the plan reached the Social Democrats, but they took no action. Just before the coup, disinformation about movements of the Polish army in the Vilnius Region was disseminated; its purpose was to induce troops in Kaunas that would potentially have opposed the coup to move towards Vilnius.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{military}} was rapidly demobilised after the Japanese surrender. At {{the end of}} the war <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> a strength of nearly 600,000personnel, of whom 224,000 were serving in the Pacific and 20,000 in Britain and other places. Demobilisation planning had begun at the end of 1942 with the final scheme being approved by the Government in March 1945. General demobilisation started on 1 October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The process generally ran smoothly, though there were protests over delays at Morotai and Bougainville. Personnel were provided with training while they waited to be demobilised and the government provided post-demobilisation assistance with employment, loans, education and other benefits. Service women were given similar assistance to their male counterparts, but were placed under pressure to return to 'traditional' family roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} {{plan was}} put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. At this time <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> a strength of 598,300 men and women. Of these, 310,600 were in Australia, 224,000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 were in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general demobilisation did not begin until 1October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. These centres were to provide information on employment, land settlement, housing, training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed. Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} the Dutch Army poorly equipped, it was also poorly trained. There had {{especially}} been little experience gained in the handling of larger units above the battalion level. From 1932 until 1936, the Dutch Army did not hold summer field manoeuvres in order to conserve military funding. Also, the individual soldier lacked many necessary skills. Before the war {{only a minority of}} young men eligible to serve in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> actually been conscripted. Until 1938, those who were enlisted only served for 24 weeks, just enough to receive basic infantry training. That same year, service time was increased to eleven months. The low quality of conscripts was not compensated by a large body of professional military personnel. In 1940, there were only 1206 professional officers present. It had been hoped that when war threatened, these deficiencies could be quickly remedied but following the mobilisation of all Dutch forces on 28 August 1939 (bringing Army strength to about 280,000 men) readiness only slowly improved: most available time was spent constructing defences. During this period, munition shortages limited live fire training, while unit cohesion remained low. By its own standards the Dutch Army in May 1940 was unfit for battle. It was incapable of staging an offensive, even at division level, while executing manoeuvre warfare was far beyond its capacities.|$|E
