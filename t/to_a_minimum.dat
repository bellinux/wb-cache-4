5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached Texas, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for potentially affected areas beginning on July18.

Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbital motion}} of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> angular {{separation}} of 3arcseconds and a maximum of 11arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300mm (12in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994 and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{requested the}} death penalty for all the convicts. Sentencing took place on 31 August: Kodani was given a 28-year prison term, and received two sentences; the first for 10 years under Indian Penal Code Section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and the second for 18 years under Section 302 (murder) and others. Her sentences are set to run consecutively, making a total of 28 years. Bajrangi received life imprisonment. Of the rest of the 30 convicted, 22 were sentenced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of 14 years and 7 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of 21 years in prison; they included Naresh Chara, Morli Sindhi, Haresh Rathod, Suresh Langado, Premchand Tiwari, Manojbhai Sindhi Kukrani and Bipin Panchal. One of the convicted, Suresh alias Shahjad Nekalkar, absconded and his sentencing was deferred.|$|E

5|$|About {{twelve hours}} after {{reaching}} typhoon status, Oliwa began to undergo unexpected explosive deepening. In a 24â€‘hour period, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as nearly doubling in intensity, from 85 to 160mph (140 to 260km/h 1-min winds), while the pressure dropped 69mbar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of 898mbar; {{based on the}} estimated intensity, the JTWC classified Oliwa as a super typhoon. The JMA, which is the official agency of the western Pacific, assessed Oliwa as reaching a peak of 115mph (185km/h 10-min winds), with a pressure of 915mbar. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated a possible eyewall mesovorticy, which is a small scale rotational feature found in the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone. Additionally, concentric eyewalls developed {{in the center of}} Oliwa, which typically occur in strong typhoons.|$|E
5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E

5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, {{the entire}} High Seas Fleet, {{including}} Bayern and Baden, left harbor {{with the intention}} of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> to prevent the British from learning of the operation. However, at 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser Moltke suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} 14 April, the eye became better defined after an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. The intensity fluctuated after outflow decreased to the north, although increasingly warm waters favored further intensification. Early on 15 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone, {{as the storm}} rapidly deepened. The outflow was enhanced by a large upper-level low well to the southeast, and shear had decreased <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> After reaching an initial peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) at 12:00UTC that day, Fantala's intensity leveled off for the following 48 hours, with its 10-minute sustained winds fluctuating between 195km/h (120mph) and 215km/h (130mph).|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 2006 {{following}} {{the completion of}} Jump Ultimate Stars as Ganbarion's first original title. The main concept was born from the desire to create a game scenario based around purification and love. Character numbers and plot twists were kept <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> {{to focus attention on}} Elena's plight. Due to recurring problems implementing the relationship mechanics and working with the Wii's controls, Pandora's Tower went through an extended development period. Despite releasing in Europe, Nintendo did not plan a North American release: prior to the announcement of Xseed Games picking up the title, a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title. Upon release, Pandora's Tower had modest commercial success and was met with mixed to positive reviews; praise went to the story and elements of combat, while the control scheme and graphics were faulted.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was kept <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, laughter, and other battle cries.|$|E
