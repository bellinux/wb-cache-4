40|$|Bahnson, BrianNeutral {{cholesterol}} ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH 1), {{also known}} as KIAA 1363 and arylacetamide deacetylase-like 1 (AADACL 1), {{has been found to}} be upregulated in several invasive cancers. The ability of this enzyme to act as a biomarker and possible therapeutic target increased <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> <b>research</b> that elucidated the endogenous substrate of NCEH 1, which was initially demonstrated to be 2 -acetyl monoalkylglycerol ether (2 -acetyl MAGE), a de novo precursor to platelet-activating factor. Later work also demonstrated a controversial role of NCEH 1 in the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters in macrophages, preventing the rupture of foam cells and thereby preventing atherosclerosis. In recent years, research on NCEH 1 has continued to portray the enzyme as a pro-tumorigenic, anti-atherosclerotic, regulatory enzyme. However, its role has also expanded to include participation in the regulation of platelet aggregation, and it has surfaced as a potential protein engineering target due to its ability to hydrolyze toxic organophosphate compounds. The structural knowledge of NCEH 1 is limited to structures of homologous serine hydrolases, the existence of an N-terminal transmembrane helix and posttranslational glycosylation predicted to occur at residues 270, 287, and 389. A variety of fusion E. coli constructs were created using a truncated NCEH 1 which removed the transmembrane helix. Further truncation removing a second hydrophobic region was found to have no effect on solubility. It was determined that NCEH 1 requires a large fusion protein, like MBP, to help with the stability of the enzyme, and cleavage of MBP fusion resulted in degradation of the protein. Functional characterization of the NCEH 1 fusion protein was carried out with paranitrophenyl acetate and a modified natural substrate 2 -thio-acetyl MAGE. Also reported within this work are the first reported KM and kcat values for the hydrolysis of PNPA by NCEH 1, determined to be 5. 3 mM and 4 s- 1, respectively. In an effort to isolate purified enzyme lacking a fusion protein partner, constructs of the 111 - 440 NCEH 1 truncation were developed for expression in the eukaryotic yeast system Pichia pastoris. Both intracellular and secreted expression protocols were developed and generated a stable construct with a small histidine tag. The construct was further modified to include a TEV protease cleavage site to allow for the removal of the histidine tag after purification and both expression protocols yielded purified stable NCEH 1. The enzyme was recovered in high purity and adequate concentration for the screening of optimal crystallization conditions providing an important first step toward the structural elucidation of NCEH 1. Previous research has indicated glycosylation for functional activity; however the work of this thesis provides an alternative view of the need for glycosylation. Instability of NCEH 1 in an E. coli expression system supports a more structural role for glycosylation over functional. Mutation of the three glycosylation residues in the Pichia pastoris secretory expression system, without a loss in functional ability, also demonstrates the possible need for glycosylation in folding and stability. The work compiled in this thesis advances our knowledge of NCEH 1. The development of an expression and purification protocol generating a purified enzyme advances the ability to functionally characterize NCEH 1. In addition, preliminary crystallization screens provided three potential conditions for future protein crystal optimization. The NCEH 1 structure will ultimately further our knowledge and ability to elevate the treatments of diseases directly correlated to its function.

The aim of this study is to determine the influence of researchers’ scientific domain on their motivation to publish in English. The results are based on a large-scale survey of Spanish postdoctoral researchers at four different universities and one research centre, and reflect responses from 1717 researchers about their difficulties, motivations, attitudes and publication strategies. Researchers’ publication experiences as corresponding authors of articles in English and in their first language are strongly related to their scientific domain.

In this contribution we consider the a-posteriori error analysis of the convective Cahn- Hilliard [4] model for varying Peclet number and interface-thickness (diffusivity) parameter. The adaptive discretization strategy uses mixed finite elements, a stable time-stepping algorithm and residual-based a-posteriori error estimation [2, 5].

Methodology: This research employs qualitative research methods. This fits with the Talanoa method recommended <b>for</b> <b>research</b> with Pacific people. Four focus groups were conducted with the smallest having four members, and the largest with 10. Overall, there were 25 participants. There were 16 questions divided into five sections: Future goals/aspirations; Assumptions/personal views on libraries; Recruitment; Professionalism and Qualifications. Key Findings: The LIS is not an industry or profession Pacific Youth are actively looking at for the future. This is due to their perceptions, the perceptions of the Pacific community as a whole, and the general low activity from the LIS in changing those perceptions. In order to lift recruiting levels amongst Pacific Youth, the LIS need to ‘go where the students are’ and show the amazing and influential work it does in our communities and society. Implications: The information received from the participants remains consistent with what the literature says in this area, even though there are very few domestic resources on the subject. This research uncovers the reasons and attitudes for why there is low value placed on librarianship as a viable career by Pacific Youth, and offers up ways in dealing with these. <b>The</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> this <b>research</b> is that both Pacific Youth would find value in the LIS as a rewarding profession to work in, and that the LIS becomes more rounded and developed as it increases its diversity...|$|R

30|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{shift in the}} use of the internet over the last 10 – 15 years or so is the relative phenomenon that is the usage of Social Media among normal citizens. In the aftermath of the riots across London and a number of other English cities which followed the killing of Mark Duggan by the Metropolitan Police in 2011, a Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) commissioned review highlighted significant inefficiencies in the the way that authorities were equipped to deal with social media as an intelligence source [5]. Social Media Intelligence, or ‘SOCMINT’, provides opportunities for providing insights into events and groups, enhancing situational awareness, and enabling the identification of criminal intent, providing it is done so in a manner that is appropriately grounded in respect of human privacy rights [6].

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the use of}} both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in organisational research as applied in the aviation environment and argues the case for both approaches in such research. Aviation safety and human performance research, with its largely observation based methodology and life critical outcomes, {{is an area where}} quality of research is more important than academic argument as to the purity of <b>research</b> methodology. Though <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> high quality <b>research</b> should always be the underlying principle in methodology selection, it appears that one research approach is more prevalent. Quantitative research methodology has been, and continues to be, the preferred research methodology under which aviation research is conducted. With its grounding in the natural sciences, this methodology is indeed a logical choice <b>for</b> <b>research</b> in an industry based in a highly evolved technical environment. From a historical perspective, early aviation research topics revolved around subjects with a basis in physics, chemistry, engineering and medicine. These subjects naturally lend themselves to the analytical and empirical nature of quantitative research methodology; underpinned by a positivistic epistemology, stating that positive substantiation of all enquiries is essential <b>for</b> authentic <b>research.</b> While research in aviation continues unabated under the positivistic approach, the maturation of the aviation industry has resulted in an expansion of research topics to include areas related to human performance. It is in this field that numerous researchers have concluded that the use of quantitative processes may exhibit flaws due to the attempted removal of the human element in the research process. The aviation environment is complex with a myriad of cultural, organisational and technical interrelationships {{considered by many to be}} a human construct. As a human construct, it is logical that some research needs a qualitative element to add context and depth to the results. Logic dictates that there may be a legitimate role <b>for</b> <b>research</b> in this field to contain elements of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. With this in mind perhaps it is time to consider qualitative research, as founded in social constructionist theory, as a valid component of aviation research methodology. Full Tex...|$|R

The acquired mass spectra are presented in simple 2 dimensional or more illustrative 3 dimensional plots, so-called MS voltammograms. A MS voltammogram visualizes the ion abundance versus m/z as a function of applied potential to the electrochemical cell. With a MS voltammogram the optimal potential can be determined for electrochemical generation of <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> metabolite <b>for</b> further <b>research,</b> e. g., a phase II metabolism study (i. e. adduct formation). It is a quick method to identify reactive pathways of the compound of interest. Additionally, electrochemistry allows to trace the reactive metabolite conjugates with targets (e. g., proteins, glutathione) without matrix interactions in contrary to traditional methods. A dedicated software program has been developed to automate and simplify the MS voltammogram acquisition. The program controls the syringe pump, the potentiostat and triggers the acquisition of mass spectra at the designated cell potentials. The total acquisition time needed for recording of a full MS voltammogram can be as short as 5 minutes. Amodiaquine an anti malaria agent was chosen as one of the model drugs to investigate oxidative metabolism using the on-line EC/MS system with automated MS voltammogram acquisition The easy and fast Electrochemical conversion of Amodiaquine into its 4 major phase I metabolites will be presented. In a second step Glutathione (GSH) is added to the electrochemically generated metabolites to form the appropriate GSH-metabolite adducts, mimicking phase II reactions. All known adducts were successfully formed and identified with MS. Additionally, MS voltammograms of other drugs and xenobiotics (e. g., acetaminophen, amiodarone, irinotecan) are presented.

Entretanto, no decorrer da pesquisa, o interesse pelos procedimentos formais dilui-se na leitura de um corpus teórico privilegiadamente filosófico (Derrida, Lévinas e Agamben, especialmente) fazendo emergir temas margeantes como crime, culpa, perdão, liberdade, que exigiu a elaboração de um pensamento úmido a respeito da literatura e de seus agentes, reais ou ficcionais. A segunda parte da tese reelabora-se no espelhamento com o corpus teórico e ficcional da pesquisa, atestando os deslimites e limiares entre discurso argumentativo, análise crítica das obras, reflexão autobiográfica e inserção de subjetividades poéticas. Esta seção é, praticamente, uma revisão da primeira e seu objetivo é trazer à tona o processo de escritura no contínuo de um acontecimento que se lança ao infinito, num movimento incapturável de solidificação e diluição conceitual que, em última instância, questiona o próprio gênero tese. O interesse, quase obsessivo, com relação à verdade, ética, sacrifício, cegueira, suicídio, lágrimas, infinito, segredo, entre outras questões im-possíveis, resulta do elemento traumático fundador do indecidível numa escritura empenhada, antes de tudo, em reconstruir o desejo pela própria pesquisa quando ela já não é o que importa. Nas duas partes da tese, embora quase nada se fale a respeito, o que secretamente tenta se reelaborar é um pensamento sobre o trauma.
