40|$|Background and Purpose—It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that spin <b>trap</b> <b>agents</b> such as N-t-butyl-phenylnitrone (PBN) may be useful as neuroprotective agents {{in the treatment of}} ischemia and stroke. However, to date, there is little information concerning the effectiveness of spin <b>trap</b> <b>agents</b> when administered in combination with the only Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacological agent for the treatment of stroke, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Thus, we determined the effects of PBN when administered before tPA on hemorrhage and infarct rate and volume. We also compared the effects of PBN with those of 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), another spin <b>trap</b> <b>agent</b> that has a different chemical structure and trapping profile, on the incidence of infarcts and hemorrhage. Methods—One hundred sixty-five male New Zealand White rabbits were embolized by injecting a blood clot into the middle cerebral artery via a catheter. Five minutes after embolization, PBN or TEMPO (100 mg/kg) was infused intravenously. Control rabbits received saline, the vehicle required to solubilize the spin traps. In tPA studies, rabbits were given intravenous tPA starting 60 minutes after embolization. Postmortem analysis included assessment of hemorrhage, infarct size and location, and clot lysis. Results—In the control group, the hemorrhage rate after a thromboembolic stroke was 24 %. The amount of hemorrhage was significantly increased to 77 % if the thrombolytic tPA was administered. The rabbits treated with PBN in th...|$|R

50|$|The first general {{method for}} {{preparation}} of sulfene as an intermediate, reported simultaneously in 1962 by Gilbert Stork and by Günther Optiz, involved removal of hydrogen chloride from methanesulfonyl chloride using triethylamine {{in the presence}} of an enamine as <b>trapping</b> <b>agent.</b> The formation of a thietane 1,1-dioxide derivative was taken as evidence for the intermediacy of sulfene. Because of the highly electrophilic character of sulfene, the use of amines presents difficulties, since they can intercept the sulfene to form complexes, which may display reduced activity in trapping reactions compared to sulfene itself. A simple alternative which avoids the use of amines involves desilylation of trimethylsilylmethanesulfonyl chloride with cesium fluoride {{in the presence of}} trapping agents.|$|E

50|$|Cyclization of the {{homologous}} 6-heptenyl radical {{is still}} selective, but is much slower—as a result, competitive side reactions {{are an important}} problem when these intermediates are involved. Additionally, 1,5-shifts can yield stabilized allylic radicals at comparable rates in these systems. In 6-hexenyl radical substrates, polarization of the reactive double bond with electron-withdrawing functional groups is often necessary to achieve high yields. Stabilizing the initially formed radical with electron-withdrawing groups provides access to more stable 6-endo cyclization products preferentially.(2)Cyclization reactions of vinyl, aryl, and acyl radicals are also known. Under conditions of kinetic control, 5-exo cyclization takes place preferentially. However, low concentrations of a radical scavenger establish thermodynamic control and provide access to 6-endo products—not via 6-endo cyclization, but by 5-exo cyclization followed by 3-exo closure and subsequent fragmentation (Dowd-Beckwith rearrangement). Whereas at high concentrations of the exo product is rapidly trapped preventing subsequent rearrangement to the endo product Aryl radicals exhibit similar reactivity.(3)Cyclization can involve heteroatom-containing multiple bonds such as nitriles, oximes, and carbonyls. Attack at the carbon atom of the multiple bond is almost always observed. In the latter case attack is reversible; however alkoxy radicals can be trapped using a stannane <b>trapping</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
40|$|In some cases, the {{formation}} of reactive species from the metabolism of xenobiotics {{has been linked to}} toxicity and therefore it is imperative to detect potential bioactivation for candidate drugs during drug discovery. Reactive species can covalently bind to trapping agents in in vitro incubations of compound with human liver microsomes (HLM) fortified with β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), resulting in a stable conjugate of <b>trapping</b> <b>agent</b> and reactive species, thereby facilitating analytical detection and providing evidence of short-lived reactive metabolites. Since reactive metabolites are typically generated by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) oxidation, it is important to ensure high concentrations of trapping agents are not inhibiting the activities of CYP isoforms. Here we assessed the inhibitory properties of fourteen trapping agents against the major human CYP isoforms (CYP 1 A 2, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, 2 D 6 and 3 A). Based on our findings, eleven trapping agents displayed inhibition, three of which had IC 50 values less than 1 mM (2 -mercaptoethanol, N-methylmaleimide and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)). Three trapping agents (dimedone, N-acetyl-lysine and arsenite) did not inhibit CYP isoforms at concentrations tested. To illustrate effects of CYP inhibition by trapping agents on reactive intermediate trapping, an example drug (ticlopidine) and <b>trapping</b> <b>agent</b> (NEM) were chosen for further studies. For the same amount of ticlopidine (1 μM), increasing concentrations of the <b>trapping</b> <b>agent</b> NEM (0. 007 – 40 mM) resulted in a bell-shaped response curve of NEM-trapped ticlopidine S-oxide (TSO-NEM), due to CYP inhibition by NEM. Thus, trapping studies should be designed to include several concentrations of <b>trapping</b> <b>agent</b> to ensure optimal trapping of reactive metabolites...|$|E

In the current study, the effects of 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) perfusion on hydroxyl radical formation in the mouse striatum were investigated using the in vivo salicylate trapping microdialysis technique. The latter uses salicylate as a <b>trapping</b> <b>agent</b> for hydroxyl radicals with formation of 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 3 -DHBA), which is measured by HPLC. Two different approaches of the technique were validated in mice. First, perfusion of the <b>trapping</b> <b>agent</b> salicylate (1 mM) via the probe in combination with 6 -OHDA (5 μM) was used to screen for radical scavenging properties of compounds in mice. Alternatively, striatal administration of 6 -OHDA in a concentration known to induce nigrostriatal denervation (1 mM), without the <b>trapping</b> <b>agent,</b> allowed to maximally challenge the neuronal microenvironment and as such to investigate both its acute and long-term effects. In the first method, as expected, glutathione (GSH) (1. 5 mM) prevented the 6 -OHDA-induced increase in 2, 3 -DHBA levels. In the second method, GSH prevented the hydroxyl radical formation, while depletion of GSH with 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one (CHO) resulted in significantly higher 2, 3 -DHBA levels than when 6 -OHDA was perfused alone. Three weeks after the local 6 -OHDA perfusion, the total striatal dopamine (DA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) content were reduced by 30 %, compared to the intact striatum, accompanied by a reduction in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive (ir) nerve terminals.
