Despite treatment, the cancer returned in July 1994. In September 1994, she made her final public appearance at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award, and was bound to a wheelchair for much of the event. Turner died nine months later at the age of 74 on June 29, 1995, of complications from the cancer at her home in Century City, Los Angeles, California.

5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen <b>therapy</b> <b>to</b> improve outcomes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe damage {{inflicted on}} the {{myocardium}} during {{acute myocardial infarction}} {{is the result of}} 2 processes: ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion injury). During the last 3 decades, <b>therapies</b> <b>to</b> reduce ischemic injury (mainly reperfusion strategies) have been widely incorporated into clinical practice. The remarkable reduction in death rates achieved with these therapies has resulted in a shift in emphasis from efforts to reduce mortality to a focus on tackling the downstream consequence of survival: post-infarction heart failure. Infarct size is the main determinant of long-term mortality and chronic heart failure, and thus, the possibility of limiting the extent of necrosis during an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is of great individual and socioeconomic value. After the great success of <b>therapies</b> <b>to</b> reduce ischemic injury, {{the time has come to}} focus efforts on <b>therapies</b> <b>to</b> reduce reperfusion injury, but in the recent few years, few interventions have successfully passed the proof-of-concept stage. In this review, we examine the past, present, and future <b>therapies</b> <b>to</b> reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury...|$|R

The speech {{of a child with}} developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech <b>therapy</b> <b>to</b> improve speech production.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to better}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light <b>therapy</b> <b>to</b> selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E

Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
