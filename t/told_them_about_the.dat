5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E

25|$|In the 1800s the {{continental}} railway system was greatly expanded. In 1897 construction opened on a spur {{line of the}} Santa Fe Railroad, which was to lead directly to the Grand Canyon; by 1901 the line was open. During {{his visit to the}} Grand Canyon in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt met two Havasupais at Indian Garden. Roosevelt <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> park that was being created, and {{that they would have to}} leave the area. In 1908 the Grand Canyon was declared a national monument, and by 1919 it had received National Park status. However, it was not until 1928 that the Havasupai finally left Indian Garden, forced out by the National Park Service.|$|E
25|$|The book, purportedly {{based on}} a true story, {{describes}} the house at 112 Ocean Avenue as remaining empty for 13 months after the DeFeo murders. In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house for what was considered to be a bargain price of $80,000. The five-bedroom house was built in Dutch Colonial style and had a distinctive gambrel roof. It also had a swimming pool and a boathouse, as it was located on a canal. George and Kathy married in July 1975 and each had their own homes, but they wanted to start fresh with a new property. Kathy had three children from a previous marriage: Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa (Missy), 5. They also owned a crossbreed Malamute/Labrador dog named Harry. During their first inspection of the house, the real estate broker <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> DeFeo murders and asked if this would affect their decision. After discussing the matter, they decided {{that it was not a}} problem.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Zelena surprises Robin, Regina, Emma, Henry, David and Snow and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> portal {{that brought}} her, Belle {{and the baby}} to the Underworld. At the same time, Belle catches up and surprises Gold who then comes clean about still being the Dark One and his reacquired powers, {{as well as her}} pregnancy, but then he tells Belle that she will have to choose whether or not she wants to be with him and that he will never change. Robin, Regina and Zelena catch up with Belle and return the baby to Zelena so she can feed her. However, Zelena was about deceive {{everyone}} by escaping with her daughter, only to have a change of heart and returning her baby, upon learning that her magic isn’t powerful enough in the Underworld to protect the baby by herself, having suspected that Hades brought her to the Underworld so that he can use her daughter to enact a time-travel spell. Meanwhile at the loft, everyone starts to believe that Zelena, even without her powers, can help them. Henry also shows them more drawings, including the story of baby Neal hearing his parents, indicating that Snow and David succeeded in getting the message to their son.|$|E

25|$|Discovery and Chatham {{proceeded}} to North America. On 16 April they made landfall at about 39°N {{and started a}} detailed survey northward. On 28 April, they encountered the American Captain Gray of the Columbia Rediviva with which they had a fruitful sharing of information; much of what Meares had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> Gray's explorations, <b>the</b> latter said, was fiction.|$|R
500|$|Princeton University Press {{received}} {{a copy of}} the typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from Smyth on August 17, 1945. The typographers had already started work from another copy. Maple Press of York, Pennsylvania, was lined up to do the printing. Because of wartime shortages, one of a publisher’s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper. Smith approached Manny and Leonard Relles from Central Paper, <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Smyth Report and its significance, and asked them if they could deliver [...] of paper to Maple Press in twelve days. They found a carload of paper on a siding in New England and sent it to York, providing enough paper for 30,000 copies, only half what Princeton University Press wanted. [...] The first edition of 30,000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30,000 copies. The presses were held for three hours while the train made its way to a siding in York, where the paper was unloaded and brought to the printing plant by trucks.|$|E
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{phone call from}} his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He {{said he did not}} get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was {{the sort of person who}} might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
500|$|The Big Lebowski {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as Barton Fink. When the Coen {{brothers}} wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, [...] "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also {{came up with the idea}} of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often [...] "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies." [...] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an [...] "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.|$|E
60|$|They {{reported}} to the Prince that Suliman, for that was the tutor's name, had boasted of having helped Celia to escape, and they bribed three men to say that Suliman himself had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>The</b> Prince, in great anger, sent his foster-brother {{with a number of}} soldiers to bring his tutor before him, in chains, like a criminal. After giving this order he went to his own room, but he had scarcely got into it when there was a clap of thunder which made the ground shake, and the Fairy Truth appeared suddenly before him.|$|R

Also, in the seventh episode of the season, [...] "Frank's Brother" [...] (2011), Frank's brother, Gino, asks the gang at the bar if Frank ever <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time he threw Frank off the John Wanamaker Building.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report was}} sent to Polish {{officials}} in London by courier and had reached them by 12 November, when it was translated into English and added to another report, [...] "Report on Conditions in Poland". Dated 27 November 1942, this was forwarded to the Polish Embassy in the United States. On December 10 the Polish Foreign Affairs Mnister, Edward Raczyński, addressed the United Nations on the killings; the address was distributed with the title The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of poison gas; about Treblinka, Bełżec and Sobibor; that the Polish underground had referred to them as extermination camps; and that {{tens of thousands of}} Jews had been killed in Bełżec in March and April 1942.

Roth stated that as they grew older, his father <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> living under <b>the</b> Nazis as a young boy and fleeing Germany in July 1938.|$|R
50|$|Howe and Hummel kept no records, {{actively}} courted publicity, {{and were}} much discussed in their day {{among the members}} of the legal profession.

Nevertheless, their decades of effective practice suggest that the partners were among the most effective and innovative attorneys to practice in the United States during the nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|Even {{before the}} first train was going to {{transport}} violin makers from Schönbach to other areas, Fred Wilfer contacted different government authorities in Bavaria and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> his plans. <b>The</b> Bavarian government welcomed his plans {{and asked him to}} create all conditions needed for the settlement to Bavaria.

60|$|But Dr. Hammerfield was {{temporarily}} crushed, {{and the battle}} raged on in new directions. On point after point, Ernest challenged the ministers.

He gave them facts, always facts, checked their excursions into the air, and brought them back to the solid earth and its facts.|$|R
25|$|Before the Xianfeng Emperor died in August 1861 in the Chengde Summer Palace, he {{appointed}} {{a group of}} eight regents – led by Zaiyuan, Duanhua and Sushun – to assist his underage son and successor, Zaichun. Yixin's flexible attitude towards dealing with the Western powers had put him {{at odds with the}} eight regents, who were politically conservative and opposed to Western influence. Upon request, Prince Gong was granted permission to travel to Chengde to attend the funeral. In Chengde, he met the Empress Dowagers Ci'an and Cixi and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> how <b>the</b> eight regents monopolised state power. When the Xianfeng Emperor's coffin arrived back in Beijing in November 1861, Prince Gong and the two empress dowagers launched a coup – historically known as the Xinyou Coup (辛酉政變) – to oust the eight regents from power. The regents were arrested and removed from their positions of power.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} office, {{convinced}} that he could take only a bold, independent course, for no help could be expected from the men he had called on. Leonard's influence over them could not be combated. He thought they might honestly doubt {{that the state of}} affairs was as serious as he had represented; but if they were convinced of this, their chief desire would be to keep the mine going long enough to save their credit, and to make disclosure gradually. He was glad he had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> richness of the Graham lode and that the claims on it were held under his personal control. On reaching his hotel, he wrote to the directors he {{had not been able to}} see, though he did not expect much result from this, and the next morning he left for his home.|$|R

Vukovich confronts Masters and during a brief struggle, Masters asks Vukovich why {{he did not take}} Grimes' advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters' behalf all along. While Vukovich is stunned at the revelation, Masters grabs a board and knocks him unconscious. Masters then covers Vukovich with shredded paper and is about to set him on fire when Vukovich wakes up and shoots Masters. Masters drops his lighter and accidentally sets himself ablaze, while Vukovich empties his gun on the burning man, killing him.|$|R

It is said that in some cases she went farther than this, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> things <b>about</b> <b>the</b> present known only to themselves and two or three intimate friends.

As usually happened in such events, {{the poor and the}} needy were the steadfast believers from the community and the suppressive were the rich and arrogant townsfolk.
