Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the Dominions finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward said in a radio broadcast, [...] "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do, without the help and support of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, {{explained}} his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, [...] "I have {{found it impossible to}} carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love." [...] Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later. His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became heiress presumptive.|$|E

500|$|Yeats finally visited Olivia at her Porchester Circle home a {{few weeks}} later to present his well-thought out {{intentions}} but, to his bewilderment, Olivia declared her love for him. Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing [...] "but after all if I could not get <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> loved it would be a comfort for a little while to devote myself to another". For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each seek advice from a friend (a [...] "sponsor"). He probably chose Florence Farr to be his sponsor while Olivia chose Valentine Fox—Harwood speculates that the sponsors advised the two {{to go ahead with the}} affair, perhaps to Yeats' discomfort.|$|E

He says, [...] "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love."

The song reached #18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the R chart, later winning her and Ray Charles a Grammy for Best R Vocal Performance By a Duo or Group. Khan returned with her first studio album in four years in 1992 {{with the release of}} <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>I</b> Am, which was a success thanks to the R songs [...] "Love You All My Lifetime" [...] and [...] "You Can Make the Story Right".|$|E

2500|$|Notwithstanding these tensions, Sara {{accompanied}} Bob Dylan on much of {{the first}} stage of the Rolling Thunder Revue, from October to December 1975. The Revue formed the backdrop to the shooting of the film Renaldo and Clara. Sara appeared in many scenes in this semi-improvised movie, playing Clara to Dylan's Renaldo. Joan Baez, a former lover of Dylan, was also a featured performer on the Revue and appeared in the film as The Woman In White. In one scene, Baez asks Dylan, [...] "What would've happened if we ever got married, Bob?" [...] Dylan replies, [...] "I married <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love." [...] Sounes suggests that the film may have been in part Dylan's tribute to his wife, since his film production company, Lombard Street Films, was named after the street in Wilmington where Sara was born.|$|E
2500|$|Giving {{the release}} a 3½ star rating, Matt Bjorke of Roughstock, saying [...] "All <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>I</b> Am had the {{potential}} to be a missed-opportunity after the first two tracks on the record but the album is saved by a meaty collection of songs that hopefully will find Reba retaining her current resurgence at radio". Allison Stewart with the Washington Post compared the album to its predecessor, Keep On Loving You, saying that the album [...] "tries harder, with worse results; McEntire and her collaborators aim for Carrie Underwood and too often wind up with warmed-over Shania Twain". On a positive note, she called her version of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] "fantastic". Thom Jurek with Allmusic gave the release a 2½ rating, saying [...] "Everything, from songs and arrangements to production tries hard to sound on the contemporary edge, but comes off as underscoring that Underwood has the corner on this sound [...] ultimately, All the Women I Am falls flat; it feels awkward in its stylistic mimicry, and has no center".|$|E
2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more <b>the</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
