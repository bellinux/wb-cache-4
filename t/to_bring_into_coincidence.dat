H [...] . F]- bonds are considered) because of two independent factors: (i) H-bonds are the stronger the more electronegative the donor (D) and acceptor (:A) atoms are [1]; (ii) for a same D-A couple [or H-bond electronegativity class, EC(D,A) ] H-bonds are the stronger the more similar the proton affinities of D and A are, a fact easily expressible {{in terms of the}} PA/pKa equalization principle [2 - 4] for which really strong H-bonds can be observed only when the differences DPA = PA(D-) – PA(:A) or DpKa = pKa(D-H) - pKa(A-H+) tend to zero (PA being the gas-phase proton affinity and pKa the co-logarithm of the corresponding acid-base dissociation constant in water). These properties are at variance with all other types of chemical bond and derive from the dual nature of the H-bond, which is not really ‘a bond’ but rather ‘two bonds’ formed by a same central proton with the two lone pairs located on the so-called donor and acceptor atoms. These considerations emphasize the role played by PA/pKa equalization in strengthening the H-bond, a hypothesis often invoked but never fully verified in the past which is now reconsidered in this Communication by a new instrument, the pKa slide rule. This is a bar-chart reporting, in separate scales, the pKa’s of the D-H proton donors and :A proton acceptors most frequently involved in D-H [...] . :A bond formation (103 entries over the - 14 <pKa< 53 range). Allowing the two scales to shift so <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>coincidence</b> the donor and acceptor molecules, the ruler permits graphical evaluation of DpKa and then empirical appreciation of D-H [...] . :A bond strengths according to the pKa equalization principle. Systematic screening of two classical databases (NIST gas-phase enthalpies and CSD geometries) was carried out for all the most important X-H [...] .

Comparison of data has lead to formulate the general equation (1) 	E(HB) = E(HB),MAX exp[-k (dD [...] . A -dD [...] .

The combined use of the pKa slide rule and eq (1) will be illustrated in a number of practical applications...|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{here the}} forward {{magnetic}} modeling, along a southern Apennines transect, {{of the new}} magnetic map of Italy (CHIAPPINI et alii, 2000 a). This map has been realized through an integrated digital magnetic anomaly database built for the Italian territory and the surrounding sea. For the first time, all the magnetic observations made onshore and offshore the Italian peninsula have been compiled into a new digital database, that gives a complete regional scale view of the magnetic anomaly crustal field over the area. The new magnetic map shows a low-amplitude (~ 20 nT), long-wavelength positive anomaly along the external southern Apennines, and negative anomalies over both the Tyrrhenian margin of southern Italy and the Apulian foreland. South of the Vulture volcano (~ 41 ° N), the positive magnetic anomaly is elongated and exactly parallel to the external belt. Furthermore, the eastern anomaly margin is exactly parallel to the belt front, and located few tens of kilometers southwest of it. The negative pattern of the Tyrrhenian Sea and margins is likely due to the high thermal flow, which significantly reduces {{the thickness of the}} susceptive crustal layer. A magnetic modeling was performed along a selected southern Apennines transect (located ca. 50 km south of the CROP 04 profile), where the shallow crustal setting (down to 5 - 6 km depth) is well-known by seismic and drill-hole data. Seismic data and oil wells suggest that the top of the magnetic basement cannot be shallower in the belt than in the Apulian foreland, where it was reached at ~ 6 km depth by the Puglia 1 well. Therefore, the positive signature of the external southern Apennines requires a strongly magnetic body beneath the belt. This source must be definitely more susceptive than the basement of the Apulian foreland. Since the solution of magnetic modeling is not unique, we show here three different settings that are able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>coincidence</b> the observed and modeled residuals. First, we speculate that, within the belt, the basement located beneath the Apulian carbonates (Apulian basement) is differentiated and contaminated at depth by susceptive magmas or mantle fluids. Then, we explore the possibility that a very magnetic composite internal crustal wedge is tectonically interposed between the Apulian carbonates and basement. Two possible settings of such composite wedge are modeled and discussed. The uniformity of the magnetic anomaly pattern along 250 km of the belt, the remarkable parallelism between the southern Apennine positive residuals and the superficial belt front, associated with the gravity data, the estimates of Moho depth, and the flexural behavior of the Apulian lithosphere beneath the belt, support the two latter models...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the heart}} of a Sirius {{receiver}} is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the Baseband Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it <b>into</b> time <b>coincidence</b> with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a [...] "pause" [...] feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the head unit, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.|$|R
