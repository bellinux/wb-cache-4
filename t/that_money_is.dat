5|$|The {{condition}} of the building continued to deteriorate although the gatehouse remained in use as a court. In 1728 George Cholmondeley, 2nd Earl of Cholmondeley leased the site from the Crown. In 1737 a courthouse {{was built on the}} site of the medieval gatehouse. Henry Sephton, a Liverpool architect and builder and John Orme, a joiner from Prescot, were appointed to carry out the work. The first floor was the courtroom and prisoners were held in the basement. By 1792 the courthouse had fallen into disrepair and money was found to repair it, although the source of <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> unclear. The court continued to function there until 1908.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} {{raised by}} union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving {{economic growth and}} creating new jobs.

There is some evidence that this is not a fallacy, as greater wealth equality seems to be correlated with greater economic growth. Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages are legitimate.|$|E

In the Gospel of Matthew account, on the other hand, he asks what they will pay him for handing Jesus over. In the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John, the devil enters into Judas, causing him to offer to betray Jesus. The Gospel of John account has Judas complaining that money has been spent on expensive perfumes to anoint Jesus which could have been spent on the poor, but adds that he was the keeper of the apostles' purse and used to steal from it.|$|E

Although it was a box office flop, having only grossed $10 million, it served as an important step for Bleu, who was still building his acting career at the time. During high school, he performed in such student productions as Footloose and Grease, winning the honor of Theatre Student of the Year.|$|E

His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> no longer {{the most important thing in}} his life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{criticism}} is <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> being spent on the rich {{at the expense of}} the poor. Critics contend that it does not serve any of the townships of Gauteng where the transport problem is severe and where the majority of the people live. However, supporters maintain that the train was never meant to be an alternative to mass public transport; instead, it was intended to reduce pressure on Johannesburg's overloaded highway system. Figures released by the Gauteng provincial government in 2003 indicated that the project would do little to relieve traffic on the over-used Ben Schoeman Highway (one of the major motivations for the project), as traffic volumes would be higher when the Gautrain was completed and operating at full capacity in 2010. Leftist political groupings like the SACP and labour movements like COSATU branded the Gautrain as a train for the rich and called on government not to proceed with the project. A national parliamentary oversight body, the Transport Portfolio Committee, held public hearings in November 2005 and subsequently advised Cabinet to scrap or postpone the project. However, National Cabinet decided on 7 December 2005 to financially support Gautrain.|$|E
500|$|The title Allah jang Palsoe is a {{reference}} to money, with an underlying didactic message <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> not everything in the world, and that an unquenchable thirst for it would turn one into [...] "a money animal". Throughout the dialogue, money {{is referred to as}} the false God, with Lie as a character who deifies money to the point of ignoring his other duties and only realising his error after it is too late. Gie, although he does become rich, does not consider money a god, but is a philanthropist and holds to his morals. The Indonesian literary critic Sapardi Djoko Damono writes that such a message would have been popular among ethnic Chinese of the contemporary Indies, and as such the play would have been a favourite of social organisations.|$|E

500|$|In the 2015–16 season, Laich's {{offensive}} production rapidly declined, {{while his}} $4.5 million cap hit stuck out {{as one of}} the only adverse aspects of a league-leading Capitals squad. On February 27, 2016, the Capitals placed Laich on waivers for the purpose of sending him to the Hershey Bears of the AHL. The following day, {{on the eve of the}} trade deadline, Laich, along with Connor Carrick and a second round selection (Carl Grundström) in the 2016 draft, were traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, his boyhood team, in exchange for Daniel Winnik and a fifth round pick (Beck Malenstyn) in the 2016 draft. The purpose of the trade was to give the Capitals salary cap relief to use toward younger core player contracts that needed re-signing the following off-season. Capitals GM Brian Maclellan called the trade, when asked, the hardest thing he had done as General Manager of the team. [...] Laich had been the longest tenured active professional Washington-area athlete at the time of the trade, concluding his service of 12 years with the franchise. In what easily stands as the most emotional trade in Capitals history since Laich was dealt to Washington in a package for Peter Bondra, one journalist wrote [...] "It's ironic <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> what ultimately forced the Caps to move Laich. This is a guy who loves the game so much, he'd probably play for free." ...|$|E

Upon meeting him {{on the day of the}} tour, the visitors find Wonka to be peculiar, lonely and acting odd at the mention of [...] "parents". The tour shows how the fantastical factory operates under the efforts of the short humans called Oompa-Loompas. The other four children succumb to temptation, and end up being caught in the factory workings and have to be safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit in worse shape than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into a river of chocolate and is sucked up by a pipe before being rescued from the fudge processing center; Violet expands into an oversized blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum despite Wonka's warning; Veruca is thrown away as a [...] "bad nut" [...] by trained squirrels down the garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk down to a few inches in height after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention. [...] During the tour, Wonka has flashbacks from his childhood where he remembers that he had a troubled relationship with his father, Wilbur. Due to his father being a dentist he was forbidden from candy consumption, but after managing to sneak a taste, he became hooked and later ran away from home to live his dream. He then returned several days later to find his father and home completely gone.|$|E
