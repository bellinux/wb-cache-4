40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of how optimal weight savings of the cylindrical shell plates in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> can be reached using higher strength duplex material. The design criteria will be based on the requirements given by the American Petroleum Institute standards API 650 for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and API 12 B for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The expected result is that use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel can reduce the weight of the material needed to build a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> A comparison between welded and bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will also be included in the work to find which joining method that is preferable. Additionally, an evaluation of the software TANKTM by Intergraph will be performed. Matlab® will be used in order to perform the evaluation to compare the results. The main difference between the standards API 650 and API 12 B is that there are already given standard sizes of bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> API 12 B. Therefore, only <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 1   625 m 3 could be compared. When comparing <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> sizes up to 1   625 m 3 the result is that bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> require a smaller mean thickness of the cylindrical shell than welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and therefore less material and total weight of the shell. If the trend continues also for larger <b>tank</b> sizes, bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will be preferable to reduce the total weight of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> By use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> the minimum required thickness can be reduced because of the higher strength of duplex stainless steel. This leads to a smaller mean shell thickness and therefore a reduced weight compared to <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. For most dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> duplex stainless steel is cheaper than austenitic stainless steel, but for some smaller dimensions, grade 1. 4307 (austenitic) is cheaper than LDX 2101 ® (duplex). Instability calculations have been performed for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> while no instability calculations have been performed for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> With the wind speed 190 km/h (proposed by API 650), the welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> need to have wind girders to stiffen the cylindrical shell and in some cases also be anchored to the ground. Anchor is not required for large dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The evaluation of TANKTM showed that most parameters agreed to the computed value of the same parameters in Matlab®. Why a few parameters not agrees is not fully known, therefore better explanations of the parameters used in the equations in API 650 would be preferable. To see the difference between Matlab® and TANKTM it would also be of interest to see how the calculations are performed in TANKTM, as only the results and inputs are printed at the moment...|$|R
