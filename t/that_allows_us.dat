5|$|There is some {{documentation}} <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> {{to reconstruct}} a genealogy of artists after Gasparo, {{from his son}} Simone onwards. Though little information is available about Simone, it appears that no works are attributed directly to him; rather, {{he appears to have}} worked as a builder when outside his father's workshop. In a bill dated 1534, Simone declares his age as 38, born in 1496, and around twenty years of age on his father's death. He also cites his firstborn son Gasparo, twelve years old, in turn a sculptor, his wife Catlina, sister of the engraver Andrea Testi of Manerbio. A daughter of Gasparo, Giulia, became the wife of an artisan potter, while a third child, Giovanni Antonio, was a qualified goldsmith, as indicated in a deed relating Stefano Lamberti and Bernardino delle Croci.|$|E
5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E

There being 22n such operations, one cannot ask for a more succinct nomenclature. Note that each finitary operation can be called a switching function.|$|E
500|$|To {{compensate}} for the cancellation of Uru Live, Cyan published all the developed online content as single-player expansion packs. Meanwhile, {{a small group of}} dedicated fans, many of them the Uru Live beta testers, were allowed to maintain their unofficial servers, called [...] "shards". Cyan released binaries of the original Uru Live servers under the banner Until Uru and coordinated with the fan shards so that players could verify their authentication keys, necessary to play the game. The shards were often unstable and no new content was released; rather, they provided a place for fans to socialize. In February 2006, Cyan opened their own official shard, called D'mala, open at no charge to Uru owners, though an invitation from the community was required. Miller revealed in a letter to fans that Cyan had received [...] "limited funding from a third party <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to breathe some refreshing new life and optimism into all things Uru." [...] As with the fan-operated servers, D'mala would feature no new content, instead allowing Cyan staff called [...] "surveyors" [...] to interact with fans and gather information.|$|E

It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E

Additionally, we situate language use among actors in sociolinguistic theories of language as action and practice (Moyer 2008).

2500|$|The syntax of {{autoepistemic logic}} uses a modal {{operator}} <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> {{to distinguish between}} what is true and what is believed.

2500|$|In {{order to}} satisfy this requirement, {{it turns out}} that in {{addition}} to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the event horizon from the outside, there must be a separate white hole interior region <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up away from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different [...] "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.|$|E
