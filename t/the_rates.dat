5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon.

Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E
