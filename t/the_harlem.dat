5|$|A route {{along the}} {{right-of-way}} of <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Division of Penn Central from 149th Street to the City line {{to allow for}} the demolition of the Third Avenue elevated. This line would either connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line or the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1966 smog, air quality {{measurements}} were recorded from only a single station, <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Courthouse building on East 121st Street, run by Braverman and his staff of 15. Taking measurements from a single station meant that the index reflected conditions in that small area, but served as a poor, unrepresentative gauge of overall air quality across the entire city. The Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regional agency run by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and headquartered at Columbus Circle, also relied on <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Courthouse laboratory. Formed in 1936, the advisory agency was authorized in 1962 by New York and New Jersey to oversee air pollution issues.|$|E
5|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> group, {{there are}} eight or ten Commandment Keeper congregations in the New York area, and others exist {{throughout}} North America {{as well as in}} Israel. Since 2000, seven rabbis have graduated from the Israelite Rabbinical Academy founded by Matthew.|$|E

5|$|I-87 {{begins in}} the Bronx at the {{northern}} approach to the Triborough Bridge, where it connects to the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) at a directional T interchange. The route heads west from the interchange, paralleling loosely with <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River through Mott Haven. After , the highway makes a turn to the north, mirroring {{a change in the}} nearby river's course. It passes by Yankee Stadium on its way to Highbridge, where the Deegan connects to the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 and U.S. Route1 or US1) at the eastern approach to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The Deegan remains in close proximity to <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River until the waterway turns westward at Kingsbridge to form the northern edge of Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|One {{neighborhood}} of New York County is contiguous with the U.S. mainland. Marble Hill {{at one time}} was part of Manhattan Island, but <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Supporting {{the fort}} were {{numerous}} defenses. Batteries {{were placed on}} Jeffrey's Hook, which extended into the Hudson, on Cox's Hill looking over Spuyten Duyvil Creek, {{at the north end}} of Manhattan controlling the King's Bridge and Dyckman's Bridge over <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River and along Laurel Hill which was to the east of the Fort and went along <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River (see also Fort Tryon Park). To the south of the fort were three lines of defense. The lines went through the hills and were made of trenches and foxholes. The first line was supported by a second line about 0.33mi (0.5km) to the north, and a third line was planned to be built 0.25mi (0.4km) north of the second.|$|E

5|$|After his {{frustrating}} junior year, Chamberlain {{wanted to}} become a professional player before finishing his senior year. However, at that time, the NBA did not accept players until after their college graduating class had been completed. Therefore, Chamberlain was prohibited from joining the NBA for a year, and decided to play for <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Globetrotters in 1958 for a sum of $50,000 (equal to about $ today).|$|E
5|$|Langston Hughes, preeminent poet of <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Renaissance {{and child}} of an {{itinerant}} couple, lived in Cleveland {{as a teenager}} and attended Central High School in Cleveland in the 1910s. He wrote for the school newspaper and started writing his earlier plays, poems and short stories while living in Cleveland. The African-American avant garde poet Russell Atkins also lived in Cleveland.|$|E

5|$|Manhattan Island is loosely {{divided into}} Downtown (Lower Manhattan), Midtown (Midtown Manhattan), and Uptown (Upper Manhattan), with Fifth Avenue {{dividing}} Manhattan's {{east and west}} sides.

To the north, <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River divides Manhattan Island from the Bronx and the mainland United States.|$|E
5|$|Wismer {{sought a}} place for his team to play, but was only able to secure the {{decrepit}} Polo Grounds, which had been without a major tenant since {{the departure of the}} New York Giants baseball team in 1957. The stadium stood on the northern tip of Manhattan, across <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River from Yankee Stadium, where the New York Giants NFL team played.|$|E
5|$|A First Avenue line, {{consisting}} of four tracks, would stretch from <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River to City Hall. At 10th Street, the line would {{cease to be}} a four-track line, with the line splitting into two branches. One branch would run to a loop near City Hall, while the other {{would go to a}} new Lafayette Avenue line in Brooklyn, running via Third Avenue and the Bowery. On the northern end, at 161st Street, the line would split into two 3-track lines. One of the lines would go to Southern Boulevard and Fordham Road; the other would continue to 241st Street after merging with the existing IRT White Plains Road Line at Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.|$|E

5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Globetrotters.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{collectible}} {{items that are}} flown on shuttle missions, such as mission patches, flags, and other personal items for the crew, were an official Harlem Globetrotters basketball and a basketball that Edwin Hubble used in 1909 when he played for the University of Chicago. After being returned to Earth, <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Globetrotters basketball would {{be placed in the}} Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would be returned to the University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reprint of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius from the library of his alma mater, MIT.|$|E
5|$|An {{improved}} {{connection between}} the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the IRT White Plains Road Line would be built using the tunnel under <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River used by the IRT Pelham Line, and would allow for the full use of the capacity on the White Plains Road Line and the Jerome Avenue Line. Eight additional trains per hour would {{be added to the}} White Plains Road Line and fourteen additional trains per hour would be added to the Jerome Avenue Line. The additional service on the Jerome Avenue Line would make use of the third track for express service.|$|E

5|$|Anfield {{has been}} the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the {{finishing}} line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield. Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> Globetrotters {{was held at the}} ground.|$|E
5|$|By noon, Knyphausen and his Hessians {{restarted}} their advance. As soon as {{the tide}} was high enough, Mathew and his troops, accompanied by Howe, were ferried across <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River. They landed under heavy fire from the American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up the hillside and dispersed the Americans until they reached a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans turned and ran towards the fort.|$|E
5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued {{to discriminate against}} blacks. Though new projects such as <b>the</b> <b>Harlem</b> River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E
