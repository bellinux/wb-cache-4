50|$|Also {{during his}} Government, Brazil {{ratified}} important pacts (for example the <b>Tlatelolco</b> <b>Treaty</b> and a quadripartite agreement also involving Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency on full-scope safeguards), which set Brazil on the nonproliferation path.|$|E
50|$|Regional {{treaties}} {{include the}} Andean Pact, {{now known as}} the Andean Community, which also includes Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, the bodies and institutions making up the Andean Integration System (AIS). Colombia has signed free-trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.Its recent trade agreements with Korea, China and Japan, have focused on Economic, and Technical Cooperation between those nations. Within the regional Caribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom), Colombia has also deepened Economic and Medical Science Research collaboration agreements. Colombia has also signed and ratified 105 international treaties or agreements relating to the protection of the environment. These include the Antarctic Treaty and Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and conventions on Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, and Wetlands. It has signed, but not ratified, the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol and conventions on Law of the Sea and Marine Dumping. Colombia also has signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the <b>Tlatelolco</b> <b>Treaty.</b> By 1975 signatories to the 1974 Declaration of Ayacucho, of which Colombia was one, had decided on limitations to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the possibility of}} a Brazilian "hidden agenda" in order to support one of the most advanced nuclear research and nuclear power programs in Latin America. From the early 1970 s to the late 1980 s Brazilian military leaders pursued the development of nuclear weapons. With the emergence of democratic regimes during the 1980 s, these covert projects were halted or terminated. The civilian administration in Brazil is now supporting an ambiguous and uncompromising position by not ratifying significant agreements renouncing nuclear weapons programs. With Brazil still rejecting the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), not formally embracing the <b>Tlatelolco</b> <b>Treaty</b> (which prohibits nuclear weapons in Latin America), and now allowing full implementation of inspections and International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) Safeguards on its nuclear facilities, the future of the Brazilian nuclear program appears to be a dormant but potential political factor in Brazilian foreign policy.

40|$|Abstract This article {{examines}} Brazil’s motivations, objectives, and action in international instances related to nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and arms control, particularly the <b>Treaty</b> of <b>Tlatelolco</b> and the <b>Treaty</b> on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The paper describes {{the evolution of}} Brazilian attitudes and decisions and discusses prospects for nuclear disarmament opened by the proposal of a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{proliferation}} on the Korean Peninsula {{in the form}} of North Korean nuclear tests and new uranium enrichment capabilities have made new paths to peace on the Peninsula more necessary than ever if a regional nuclear arms race - and potential nuclear war - is to be averted. One avenue to peace is the establishment of legally binding and internationally verified regional nuclear-weapon-free-zones (NWFZs). These have already been successfully established in such regions as Latin America (1967), the South Pacific (1985), Southeast Asia (1995), Africa (1996) and Central Asia (2006). After reviewing previous proposals for such a zone on the Peninsula and in the region more generally, the authors advance the case {{for the establishment of a}} Korea-Japan Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone that would build on the current nuclear-weapon-free status of Japan and South Korea, and facilitate phased and verified North Korean accession to the zone using similar &# 039;later-entry-into-force&# 039; mechanisms as those of the Latin American NWFZ (<b>Tlatelolco</b> <b>Treaty).</b> The political preconditions for this already exist, given North Korea&# 039;s endorsement in principle of NWFZ arrangements; and new approaches among several major actors, including Japan, the US Obama Administration, and China, on multilateral initiatives to address Northeast Asian regional issues...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho focaliza o complexo processo de integração {{bilateral}} Brasil-Argentina, iniciado formalmente na década de 80, desdobrado em sua dupla abrangência: a) cooperação pacífica da tecnologia nuclear; b) constituição de um mercado comum. A evolução desse processo conduziu-se através de ciclos fundamentais: primeira etapa, antecedentes de aproximação; segunda etapa, os decisivos instrumentos da ampla integração; terceira etapa, solidificação de duas bases, uma de nível tecnológico nuclear, pactuando um sistema sui generis de salvaguardas e a vigência do Tratado de Tlatelolco (emendado), e, outra, de nível econômico pelo Tratado de Assunção, instituindo o Mercosul. The present work {{focuses on}} the complex bilateral integration process involving Brazil and Argentina that began formally during the 80 's, and displayed in its double scope: a) pacific cooperation on nuclear technology; b) constitution of a common market. This process evolution took place in three fundamental circles: the first one, approximation antecedents; the second one, decisive instruments for a large integration; and the third one, the solidification of two basis, one at the nuclear technological level, joining the two countries in the sui generis back up system and {{the operation of the}} <b>Tlatelolco</b> <b>Treaty,</b> the other, at the economic level instituting the Mercosur by the Asunción Treaty...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how the PRC, {{during the}} three decades since its establishment, has responded to {{international}} politics involving arms control and disarmament (ACD) issues, and explores the essence of China's approach to concepts of arms control and disarmament. The central finding is that, despite its seeming relaxation of hostility towards international ACD activities, and the more active and flexible part it has played in them at the UN since the mid- 1970 s, China remains unconvinced {{of the value of}} these activities. This does not make it dangerous, irrational or immature. Chapters Two to Five provide a comprehensive account of the history of Chinese ACD policy between 1949 and 1978. Each chapter represents a distinctive period of Chinese arms control policy. Although more interested in the banning of the use, rather than the possession, of atomic weapons, the PRC behaved at first as an uncritical disciple of Soviet ACD positions (Chapter Two). During the second period (Chapter Three), China became increasingly uneasy about international ACD efforts and began to deviate from the Soviet stance. Moscow's denial of concrete assistance to China's nuclear weapons development, and the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty, eventually led the PRC into a period (Chapter Four) of open hostility towards nearly all international ACD initiatives. Then, in 1964, China's first nuclear test likewise radically changed its outlook on ACD matters. The final period (Chapter Five) examines its record at the UN in this regard, showing how the PRC was persuaded to commit itself to the <b>Tlatelolco</b> <b>Treaty</b> and to the 1978 UN Special Session on Disarmament. In conclusion, however, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that the PRC has been committed to the concept of a disarmament process through arms control which both the US and the USSR, in their very different ways, have accepted. China has participated in international ACD negotiations while not really believing in their objectives, based as these are on a permanency of two superpowers. It is to be hoped that China's increasing involvement in the UN disarmament negotiation machinery will feed back into PRC policy-making and lead to a more positive and more willing participation in these ACD negotiations. </p...|$|E
