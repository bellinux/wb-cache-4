2500|$|After World War I, Bion studied {{history at}} The Queen's College, Oxford, earning a {{bachelor}} of arts degree in 1922, then studying medicine at University College London. Initially attracted to London by the [...] "strange new subject called psychoanalysis", he met and was impressed by Wilfred Trotter, an outstanding brain surgeon who published the famous Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War in 1916, based on {{the horrors of the}} First World War. This was to prove an important influence on Bion's interest in group behavior. Having qualified in medicine by means of the Conjoint Diploma (MRCS England, LRCP London) in 1930 Bion spent seven years in psychotherapeutic training at the Tavistock Clinic, an experience he regarded, in retrospect, as having had some limitations. It did, however, bring him into fruitful contact with Samuel Beckett. He wanted to train in Psychoanalysis and in 1938 he began a <b>training</b> <b>analysis</b> with John Rickman, but this was brought to an end by the Second World War.|$|E

As his interest in psychoanalysis increased, he underwent <b>training</b> <b>analysis,</b> between 1946 and 1952, with Melanie Klein. He met his second wife, Francesca, at the Tavistock in 1951. He joined a research group of Klein's students (including Hanna Segal and Herbert Rosenfeld), who were developing Klein's theory of the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions, for use in the analysis of patients with psychotic disorders. He produced a series of highly original and influential papers (collected as [...] "Second Thoughts", 1967) on the analysis of schizophrenia, and the specifically cognitive, perceptual, and identity problems of such patients. To this he added a valuable final section called Commentary, showing how some of his views on clinical and theoretical matters had changed.|$|E

40|$|Neural spike <b>train</b> <b>analysis</b> is an {{important}} task in computational neuroscience which aims to understand neural mechanisms and gain insights into neural circuits. With the advancement of multielectrode recording and imaging technologies, {{it has become increasingly}} demanding to develop statistical tools for analyzing large neuronal ensemble spike activity. Here we present a tutorial overview of Bayesian methods and their representative applications in neural spike <b>train</b> <b>analysis,</b> at both single neuron and population levels. On the theoretical side, we focus on various approximate Bayesian inference techniques as applied to latent state and parameter estimation. On the application side, the topics include spike sorting, tuning curve estimation, neural encoding and decoding, deconvolution of spike trains from calcium imaging signals, and inference of neuronal functional connectivity and synchrony. Some research challenges and opportunities for neural spike <b>train</b> <b>analysis</b> are discussed.

In addition, using bursting activity generated by electrically coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons, the MLZC is able to quantify and characterize bursts synchronization, when classical measures fail...|$|R
2500|$|In 1932, after {{a second}} year at Saint Anne's Clinique de Maladies Mentales et de l'Encéphale, Lacan became a {{licensed}} forensic psychiatrist. In 1932 {{he was awarded the}} [...] (roughly equivalent to an M.D. degree) for his thesis On Paranoiac Psychosis in its Relations to the Personality (De la Psychose paranoïaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalité suivi de Premiers écrits sur la paranoïa; Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1975). It had a limited reception in the 1930s because it was not published until four decades later, but it did find acclaim, especially by surrealist artists. This thesis is thought to mark Lacan's entry into psychoanalysis. It shows Lacan’s dissatisfaction with traditional psychiatry and the growing influence of Sigmund Freud on his works. ‘Paranoid Psychosis and its Relation to the Personality’ was based on observations of several patients with a primary focus on one female patient whom Lacan called Aimee. Also in 1932, Lacan translated Freud's 1922 text, [...] "Über einige neurotische Mechanismen bei Eifersucht, Paranoia und Homosexualität" [...] ("Some Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia and Homosexuality") as [...] "De quelques mécanismes névrotiques dans la jalousie, la paranoïa et l'homosexualité" [...] ("On some neurotic mechanisms in jealousy, paranoia and homosexuality"). It was published in the Revue française de psychanalyse. In Autumn of that same year, Lacan began his <b>training</b> <b>analysis</b> with Rudolph Lowenstein, which was to last until 1938.|$|E

40|$|Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) allow experimentalists {{to record}} extracellularly from many neurons {{simultaneously}} for long durations. They therefore often {{require that the}} data analyst spends {{a considerable amount of}} time first sorting the spikes, then doing again and again the same basic analysis on the different spike trains isolated from the raw data. This spike <b>train</b> <b>analysis</b> also often generates a considerable amount of figures, mainly diagnostic plots, that need to be stored (and/or printed) and organized for efficient subsequent use. The analysis of our data recorded from the first olfactory relay of an insect, the cockroach Periplaneta americana, has led us to settle on such “routine ” spike <b>train</b> <b>analysis</b> procedures: one applied to spontaneous activity recordings, the other used with recordings where an olfactory stimulation was repetitively applied. We have developed a group of functions implementing a mixture of common and original procedures and producing graphical or numerical outputs. These functions can be run in batch mode and do moreover produce an organized report of their results in an HTML file. A R package: STAR (Spike <b>Train</b> <b>Analysis</b> with R) makes these functions readily available to the neurophysiologists community. Like R, STAR is open source and free.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a stochastic spike <b>train</b> <b>analysis</b> method called joint interspike interval dierence (JISID) analysis. By design, this method detects changes in firing interspike intervals (ISIs), called local trends, within a 4 -spike pattern in a spike <b>train.</b> This <b>analysis</b> classifies 4 -spike patterns that have similar incremental changes. It characterizes the higher-order serial dependence in spike firing relative {{to changes in}} the firing history. Mathe-matically, this spike <b>train</b> <b>analysis</b> describes the statis-tical joint distribution of consecutive changes in ISIs, from which the serial dependence of the changes in higher-order intervals can be determined. It is similar to the joint interspike interval (JISI) analysis, except that the joint distribution of consecutive ISI dierences (ISIDs) is quantified. The graphical location of points in the JISID scatter plot reveals the local trends in firing (i. e., monotonically increasing, monotonically decreas-ing, or transitional firing). The trajectory of these points in the serial-JISID plot traces the time evolution of these trends represented by a 5 -spike pattern, while points in the JISID scatter plot represent trends of a 4 -spike pattern. We provide complete theoretical interpretations of the JISID analysis. We also demonstrate that this method indeed identifies firing trends in both simulated spike trains and spike trains recorded from cultured neurons. ...|$|R
