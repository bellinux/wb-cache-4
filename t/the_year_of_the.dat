25|$|In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fictional {{universe}} <b>of</b> Eä {{began when}} the Ainur entered Arda, following the creation events in the Ainulindalë and long ages of labour throughout Eä, the universe. Time from that point was measured using Valian <b>Years,</b> though <b>the</b> subsequent history <b>of</b> Arda was divided into three time periods using different <b>years,</b> known as <b>the</b> <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lamps, <b>the</b> <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trees and <b>the</b> <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. A separate, overlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Children <b>of</b> Ilúvatar'. <b>The</b> first such Age began with <b>the</b> Awakening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves during <b>the</b> <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trees and continued {{for the first six}} centuries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun.

25|$|In <b>the</b> fictional works <b>of</b> J. R. R.

5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contest is not given.

When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E

5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact}} that also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} <b>The</b> <b>Year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E

5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South Vietnamese forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monkey.

However, unbeknown to the South Vietnamese and their allies, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to use the cease-fire to launch a large offensive in the south in order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of Democratic Republic of Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E
