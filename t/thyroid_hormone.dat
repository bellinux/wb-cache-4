5|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> is biologically active.|$|E
5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone,</b> implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> for normal fetal development is well established. Through animal experiments (1, 2) and clinical studies (3, 4), <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> have been clearly {{found to be}} crucial in brain development, maturation, and normal function. The fetal thyroid begins to produce <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> at about 10 to 12 weeks of gestation. During the first trimester, <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> are supplied exclusively by the mother, whereas {{during and after the}} second trimester, <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> are supplied by both the mother and the fetus (although probably primarily by the mother).

5|$|Treatment of {{the thyroid}} disease usually leads to {{resolution}} of the paralytic attacks. Depending {{on the nature of}} the disease, the treatment may consist of thyrostatics (drugs that reduce production of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone),</b> radioiodine, or occasionally thyroid surgery.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> physiology.

40|$|Pereira Jr. JC, Pradella-Hallinan M, Pessoa HL. Imbalance between <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> and the dopaminergic {{system might}} be {{central to the}} {{pathophysiology}} of restless legs syndrome: a hypothesis. Clinics. 2010; 65 (5) : 547 - 54. Data collected from medical literature indicate that dopaminergic agonists alleviate Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms while dopaminergic agonists antagonists aggravate them. Dopaminergic agonists is a physiological regulator of thyroid-stimulating hormone.

40|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> {{regulate}} {{growth by}} several mechanisms. In {{addition to their}} negative feedback effect on the stimulatory hormones thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyrotropin (TSH), <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> also regulate their receptors in various physiological and pathological conditions. Up-regulation and down-regulation of the thyroid receptors fine-tune the biological effects exerted by the <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones.</b> Interestingly, the deiodinase enzyme system is another intrinsic regulator of thyroid physiology that adjusts the availability of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> to the tissues, which is essential for normal growth and development. Almost all chronic diseases of childhood impair growth and development. Every disease may have a unique mechanism to halt linear growth, but reduced serum concentration or diminished local availability of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> {{seems to be a}} common pathway.

5|$|Thyroid hormones act by {{crossing}} the cell membrane and binding to intracellular nuclear <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> receptors TR-α1,TR-α2,TR-β1 and TR-β2, which bind with hormone response elements and transcription factors to modulate DNA transcription.

5|$|Iodine deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency. The use of iodised salt used to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (<b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone)</b> levels, usually with an additional precipitant.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> {{regulate}} neuronal proliferation, migration, process outgrowth, synaptic development, and myelin {{formation in}} specific brain regions. Because brain development occurs during discrete windows of time, inappropriate levels of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> in definitive periods can produce permanent damage, {{the nature of}} which depends upon the timing and magnitude of the insult. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> cross the placenta and enter the brain primarily as thyroxine (T 4); therefore, conditions selectively lowering serum T 4 levels alter brain hormone availability. Triiodothyronine (T 3) is the predominant form of the hormone that binds to the receptor. T 3 is produced from T 4 in the brain by the enzyme type II, 5 ’-deiodinase. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic environmental toxicants that bear a striking structural resemblance to the active <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> and can, depending upon the species, dosage, and congener used, act as agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists to <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormones...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the only}} source of <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules.

5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient <b>thyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability.
