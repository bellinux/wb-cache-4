5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and <b>Travel</b> <b>Mode.</b> These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E
5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} {{silhouette}} of a Pokémon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to standard Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, <b>Travel</b> <b>Mode</b> allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E

500|$|Adventure mode is the {{secondary}} game mode in Dwarf Fortress. Unlike Fortress mode, Adventure mode has the player control a single character. In Adventure mode, character creation works {{similar to other}} role-playing games, with the player choosing the name, gender, race and personality of the character. Players also select from a choice of various skills and attributes, such as strength and agility. Like in Fortress mode, these skills further improve normally through exercised use unlike regular experience. They play in the same generated worlds, and these worlds continue to develop and advance while time passes as in Fortress mode. The character starts off in a random town, depending on the character's race, and can interact with the various non-player characters (NPCs). NPCs can speak about the surrounding areas or offer to follow and help the player. Quests are given via a [...] "rumor" [...] system, where rumors can spread among the NPCs, or players can decide to serve a leader and attain quests from them. Characters can also write poems, books and music compositions, based on procedurally generated forms and styles. The player can choose to form a site and build using materials they collect. Players can use the quick <b>travel</b> <b>mode</b> to quickly travel between geographical regions.|$|E

40|$|The traffic {{state of}} the urban road network is {{determined}} by travelers’ choices of <b>travel</b> <b>modes</b> and routes.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{associations of}} childrens active travel (i. e. walking, cycling) {{to school and}} non-school destinations with time spent in sedentary behavior and physical activity at different intensities, and associations stratified by sex. Methods: Between 2011 and 2012, 375 Australian school children aged 8 - 13 years (61 % female) were recruited into a cross-sectional study. Childrens <b>travel</b> <b>modes</b> to school and non-school destinations, and socio-demographic information were assessed through child and parent surveys. Daily time spent in sedentary behavior and physical activity intensities was measured objectively through accelerometer counts from an Actiheart monitor worn on four consecutive days. Associations of active travel with sedentary behavior and physical activity variables were determined using linear mixed models while accounting for clustered sampling and covariates (age, sex, socio-economic factors, Actiheart wear time). Multiple imputation (MissForest method) was used to handle missing at random survey and accelerometer data in 104 (28 %) children. Results: Active <b>travel</b> <b>modes</b> to non-school destinations were positively associated with childrens moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (. b= 0. 18, p= 0. 01) but not with their sedentary behavior, light or total physical activity. Active <b>travel</b> <b>modes</b> to school were not associated with childrens sedentary behavior or physical activity across intensities. No statistically significant differences by sex were detected in the observed associations. However, the positive association between active <b>travel</b> <b>modes</b> to non-school destinations and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity neared statistical significance in boys (. b= 0. 15, p= 0. 07) but not in girls. Conclusions: Active travel was positively associated with childrens physical activity but not their sedentary behavior levels. Active travel to non-school destinations may have more potential to increase childrens moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels, than active travel to school...|$|R
