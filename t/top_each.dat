5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the <b>top,</b> <b>each</b> successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and <b>top</b> <b>each</b> other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E

Below this level are subterranean vaulted cellars containing four rooms, a prison, and a well. Access was from the main entrance lobby or direct from the kitchen.|$|E

Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News commented that [...] "like all hourlong episodes of comedies, this one becomes a little bloated in the middle. But it holds {{up for the}} most part and has some very funny and poignant moments, including an emotional rooftop scene between Will and Grace that defines their friendship." [...] Whitney Matheson of USA Today said she [...] "was bored to tears" [...] by the episode, while Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk thought it was a [...] "fun episode". Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated was not complimentary towards Connick: [...] "Whoever {{came up with the idea}} to cast Connick on Will & Grace should be fired." [...] A writer from Entertainment Weekly, however, commented that Leo [...] "fits right in to the antic Will & Grace world of Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide was not thrilled of the idea of Grace getting married, writing: [...] "Well, is the show called Will & Grace & Leo? I don't think so." [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall commented that Will & Grace [...] "has already been infected with a sense of cattiness and despair, as the writers try to <b>top</b> <b>each</b> other's nasty one-liners. A happy, healthy relationship could be just the cure for what's ailing the one-time Emmy winner." ...|$|E

The test particle has a velocity of +v, and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2v. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream. But {{it is not at all}} clear that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the <b>top,</b> <b>each</b> particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the test particle be drawn towards the bottom stream.|$|E

[...] According to The Hollywood Reporter, Clarkson is [...] "the embodiment of the perfect pop star. Her unmistakable pipes are a powerful presence in top 40 and country, with forays into anthemic rock and dance."

2500|$|... 200 {{million years}} ago the Jurassic sea {{extended}} from the North Sea basin far to the South and covered the late Triassic land. At that time the Hesselberg region was {{on the border of}} that sea. Many affluxes brought huge masses of rubble from the eastern mainland and formed a multilayer seafloor, which had a rich flora and fauna. During more than 40 million years the different layers of Jurassic rock consecutively deposited: the Black Jurassic at the bottom, the Brown Jurassic above, and the White Jurassic at the <b>top.</b> <b>Each</b> of these layers is characterised by the typical rock and embedded fossils that are specific for each era. Because certain fossils are solely found in certain layers, they are referred to as index fossils. In Jurassic rock ammonites are the index fossils. In the course of time the Jurassic sea silted up completely. Because during the Early Jurassic Hesselberg was located in a sheltered basin it was not as eroded by wind and water as the plain between the mountain and the Hahnenkamm. The hard rock resisted erosion and left Hesselberg as a distinctive Zeugenberg rising above the landscape like an island. This kind of mountain-formation is known as inverted relief.|$|E

TELAR superstructure is a turret containing the fire control radar {{at the front}} and a launcher with four ready-to-fire missiles on <b>top.</b> <b>Each</b> TELAR is operated by a crew of four and is equipped with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protection. The radar fitted to each TELAR, {{referred to as the}} 'Fire Dome' by NATO, is a monopulse type radar and can begin tracking at the missile's maximum range (32km/20mi) and can track aircraft flying at between 15m and 22km (50 to 72,000ft) altitudes. It can guide up to three missiles against a single target. The 9K37 system supposedly has much better ECCM characteristics (i.e., is more resistant to ECM and jamming) than the 3M9 Kub system that it replaces. While the early Buk had a day radar tracking system 9Sh38 (similar to that used on Kub, Tor and Osa missile system), its current design can be fitted with a combined optical tracking system with a thermal camera and a laser range-finder for passive tracking of the target. The 9K37 system can also utilise the same 1S91 Straight Flush 25kW G/H band continuous wave radar as the 3M9 [...] "Kub" [...] system.|$|E
