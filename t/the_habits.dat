5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E

6000|$|You {{will surely}} {{agree with me}} that <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of mind {{required}} for such a study as this, is the very same as is required for successful military study. In fact, I should say that the same intellect which would develop into a great military man, would develop also into a great naturalist. I say, intellect.

[...] And specially valuable are they, surely, to the military man, the very essence of whose study, to be successful, lies first in continuous and accurate observation, and then in calm and judicious arrangement.|$|R

5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar of the living world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> and attributes {{of plants and animals}} in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E
5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland {{and many other}} parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> and activities of the people he met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of the century, Wood was {{influential}} in changing <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and Hull. His programming was summarised in The Manchester Guardian, which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); Mozart (28); Dvořák (16); Weber (16); J.S. Bach (14); Brahms (14); Elgar (14); and Liszt (13).|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano {{described}} the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.|$|E
