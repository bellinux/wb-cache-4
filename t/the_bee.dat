5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> nest to parasitize <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> larvae.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of certain chemical substances—such as ethanol or pesticides or defensive toxic biochemicals produced by plants—to a bee's environment can cause <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> to display abnormal or unusual behavior and disorientation. In sufficient quantities, such chemicals can poison and even kill <b>the</b> <b>bee.</b> The effects of alcohol on bees {{have long been}} recognized. For example, John Cumming described the effect in an 1864 publication on beekeeping.|$|E

50|$|The {{video for}} the song begins with a {{gradually}} zooming-out shot of a beehive. A swarm of mechanical bees then emerge from the hive and attack a city. A large amount of papers blow around a fleeing man, while <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> watch. <b>The</b> <b>bees</b> then kidnap several people. Following are multiple shots of <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> flying over scenery, taking everyone they see. The kidnapped people then emerge from water, their ultimate fate unknown. <b>The</b> <b>bees</b> return to their hive.|$|R
50|$|Flowers are {{the sole}} {{source of food}} and water for <b>the</b> <b>bees.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bees</b> have long lifespans and inhabit a wide variety of {{geographical}} ranges, which allows to visit a number of different plants. <b>The</b> <b>bees</b> also have a pattern of visiting certain plants at various times throughout the day.|$|R

5|$|Bees {{are also}} mimicked by {{plants such as}} <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> orchid which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.|$|E
5|$|In astronomy, constellations {{named after}} {{arthropods}} include the zodiacal Scorpius, the scorpion, and Musca, the fly, {{also known as}} Apis, <b>the</b> <b>bee,</b> in the deep southern sky. Musca, the only recognised insect constellation, was named by Petrus Plancius in 1597.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the other}} packs, The Trouble with Clones {{contained}} about an hour of gameplay.

5000|$|One of {{the best}} known stories {{regarding}} Saint Modomnoc concerns his work as a beekeeper. Bees were kept both for their honey and the production of mead. Modomnoc was given charge of <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> in a sheltered corner of the monastery garden where he planted the kinds of flowers best loved by <b>the</b> <b>bees.</b> He talked to <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> as he worked among them and they buzzed around his head in clouds as if they were responding. He would walk among the hives in the evening and talk to them, and <b>the</b> <b>bees,</b> for their part, would crowd out to meet him. He was never stung. When the time came for him to return to Ireland, three times <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> followed in great swarm and settled on the mast. St. David perceiving this occurrence to be a good omen allowed Modomnoc to bring <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> to Ireland. [...] When he landed, he set up a church at a place called Bremore, near Balbriggan, in County Dublin, and here he established <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> in a garden just like the one they had in Wales.|$|R

50|$|It is also {{essential}} {{to look at}} how starved <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> are. If <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> are dying, thin sugar syrup should be directly sprinkled on <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> as {{they will not be able}} to fly or process hard candy. In about an hour, this should help save their lives. Further, they can be fed syrup and candy using feeders.|$|R
5|$|The {{precious}} metals {{silver and gold}} were not common in the Eastern Ranges, while copper was mined in Gachantivá, Moniquirá and in {{the mountains to the}} south of the Bogotá savanna at Sumapaz. The process of elaborating the fine filigree figures took place by creating a mold of obsidian, shale or clay, filling the open space with bee wax, obtained through trade with the neighbouring indigenous peoples from the Llanos Orientales to the east of the Altiplano; the Achagua, Tegua and Guayupe. <b>The</b> <b>bee</b> wax occupied the voids of the mold and the mold was heated by fires. <b>The</b> <b>bee</b> wax would melt, leaving an open space where the tumbaga or sometimes gold was poured into, a process called lost-wax casting. Using this method, modern tunjos are still fabricated in the centre of Bogotá.|$|E
5|$|A higher {{percentage}} of female workers of <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> species Apis cerana are reported to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E
5|$|After 1994, {{when the}} American musicians Curtis Mayfield and Frank Sinatra were both issued Grammy Legend Awards, the honors {{have been given}} to {{recording}} artists intermittently. Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti was the 1998 recipient of the award. The following year, British singer-songwriter Elton John was recognized with the honor. <b>The</b> <b>Bee</b> Gees became the first recipients of the award in the 21st century when the brothers were acknowledged by the Grammys in 2003. Overall, fourteen solo musicians and one band have received the Grammy Legend Award.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} story, a mouse is walking along when a bee nest falls on his head.

As he goes deeper, <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> still like <b>the</b> mouse until they hate his bed (the mouse being {{submerged}} in the mud) and finally go away, allowing the mouse to go home to take a bath.|$|R
5|$|Akeelah and <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> is a 2006 American drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Doug Atchison. It tells the story of Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer), an 11-year-old girl who participates in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, her mother (Angela Bassett), her schoolmates, and her coach, Dr. Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). The cast also features Curtis Armstrong, J.R. Villarreal, Sean Michael Afable, Erica Hubbard, Lee Thompson Young, Julito McCullum, Sahara Garey, Eddie Steeples, and Tzi Ma.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee is {{the name}} of a {{prominent}} character in the Transformers franchise. His name denotes his black-on-yellow vehicle paint job, directly referencing <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> genus because of its black and yellow stripes. Bumblebee is also the name of an automotive racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle; it can be found mainly on Chevrolet Camaros (which happens to be the Transformers Autobot's most popular vehicle mode).|$|E

5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together {{so that they are}} played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived {{from the fact that the}} album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E
5|$|Outside the United States, {{the film}} debuted at the Sprockets Toronto International Film Festival for Children on April 23, 2006, {{where it was}} elected the best film by {{the kids in the}} ages of 10 and 11.

5|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> can sting repeatedly without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, the sting is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|E
