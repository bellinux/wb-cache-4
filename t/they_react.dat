5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, but {{it has been shown that}} <b>they</b> <b>react</b> more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when <b>they</b> <b>react</b> with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, <b>they</b> <b>react</b> adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E
40|$|A {{glycoprotein}} {{was isolated}} and purified to homogeneity from the serum {{of a patient}} with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. NaDodSO 4 /PAGE of the glycoprotein revealed a single major band at Mr approximately 77, 000. Antibodies to this glycoprotein were shown to possess the following immunoreactivity: (i) <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> by radioimmunoassay with sera obtained {{at the time of}} diagnosis from 17 of 42 patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis and with only 2 of 58 sera from either matched controls or patients with hepatitis A or hepatitis B, (ii) <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> with sucrose gradient fractions from a proven infectious non-A, non-B hepatitis serum at a peak density of 1. 14 g/ml and in the soluble protein fractions on top of the gradient, and (iii) <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> in ELISA with disrupted human T-cell lymphocytotropic virus type III (HTLV-III), and (iv) <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> in immunoblots with a protein of Mr 74, 000 derived from HTLV-III...|$|R

5|$|The {{hydroxides}} {{themselves are}} the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, and {{may be used to}} separate thiols from petroleum. <b>They</b> <b>react</b> with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. <b>They</b> <b>react</b> to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when <b>they</b> <b>react.</b> Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The Commission {{found that}} when the tales of {{slaughtering}} of Western Pakistanis reached to Pakistani soldiers stationed in East, <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> violently, {{and in the process}} of restoring the authority of the Government, committed severe excesses on the local Bengali population.|$|R
2500|$|I. J. Wickrema was a {{promising}} {{leader of the}} GCSU in the 1960s. He led the GCSU during the [...] "Golden era" [...] in its history. The total number of members was around 30,000 out of 50,000 clerical workers in Sri Lanka in the 1960s. He organised branch committees of the union throughout the country, giving more strength to it. He was elected {{as secretary of the}} union and later became its President. During his period in office (1965–70), many incidents happened in Sri Lanka's politics and <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> to the changes by taking the side of the worker.

40|$|The {{research}} of factors influencing bird's species diversity and abundance {{will allow us}} to manage the landscape in the way to create suitable conditions for survival of species. For the purposes of this work, I divided bird assemblages into 3 groups on local level: forest birds, shrubland birds and grassland birds. The forest bird species were most influenced by height of canopy, its compactness and fragmentation of the forests. The size of the fragment, fragment matrix, isolation of the fragment and birds sensitivity to edge effect were deciding factors of number of species and individuals in each fragment. The shrubland birds were most influenced by vegetation structure in meaning of presence of shrubs, trees and grassland. They were also influenced by vegetation species composition, frequency and form of disturbances (fire, grazing), <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> positively to transformation of landscape into agroecosystems and <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> negatively to shrub encroachement. Grassland birds reacted to various height of grass, <b>they</b> <b>reacted</b> negatively to presence of trees and shrubs and also to disturbances caused by human. It is the least studied group of birds in Africa. As fot the elevation gradient, the lowland assemblages of birds changed to mountains assemblages at attitude of about 1250 above the sea [...] ...|$|R
5|$|The Sustainment Brigade and its {{soldiers}} {{have been the subject}} of numerous army publications during its tours in Iraq, most of which having to do with the culture and lifestyle of soldiers serving the unit. Among these have been feature stories by the Multi-National Force: Iraq public affairs office, on married soldiers who deploy together. The Army Logistician, an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units, published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their September–October 2007 issue. This story was intended to display the versatility of sustainment brigades overall. Another story was written for defenselink.mil, the press service for the United States Armed Forces in March 2007 about soldiers of the brigade and how <b>they</b> <b>react</b> to the desert climate of the country, having to cope with sandstorms and other issues.|$|E
5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, <b>they</b> <b>react</b> with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). <b>They</b> <b>react</b> aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E

5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which <b>they</b> <b>react</b> to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter <b>they</b> <b>react</b> less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
