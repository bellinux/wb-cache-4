40|$|Against the {{background}} of reports of client influence on valuations in Nigeria from bank managers (who allege deliberate inflation of mortgage valuation estimates), and from <b>taxation</b> <b>officers</b> (who allege deflation of valuation estimates so as to reduce tax), this paper examined the nature of client influence on the valuer in Nigeria and on his value estimates. The research involved the distribution of 95, 54 and 25 questionnaires backed up with interviews to valuation firms and their clients (property development/property investmentportfolios managers and banks) respectively. Data was measured by means of Likert scales and analysed using weighted average frequency distributions and the kruskal-wallis test on non-parametric data. It was discovered that clients do influence valuations {{and most of the}} influence comes from individual clients for mortgage and sale valuations. The influence normally takes the form of 6 - 15...|$|R

The objection is either allowed, in which case the taxpayer has generally won, or it is disallowed, in which case the taxpayer can object to the disallowance. If the taxpayer objects to a disallowance, the same process takes place but with a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal instead of a <b>taxation</b> <b>officer.</b> Following a disallowance at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the taxpayer can then object to the Federal Court of Australia.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the criticisms}} {{directed}} at the accounting profession is that auditing standards are determined, examined, evaluated and interpreted by accountants themselves through their professional bodies. It appears that auditing standards fall behind changes in society 2 ̆ 7 s values and expectations. This paper examines the need for and significance of incorporating changes in society 2 ̆ 7 s values and expectations into auditing standards as perceived by different groups within Australian society. This examination {{is based on a}} questionnaire survey of external auditors, company accountants, internal auditors, solicitors, academics, <b>taxation</b> <b>officers,</b> company directors and others. The study revealed that these groups support the need for the incorporation of changes in society 2 ̆ 7 s values and expectations into auditing standards. Although participants agreed on the need for the incorporation of changes in society 2 ̆ 7 s values and expectations into auditing standards they did not agree on the significance of this incorporation. This study also revealed that the perceptual differences are subjective in nature and not influenced by the participant 2 ̆ 7 s qualifications, income, experience, gender or marital status...|$|R

50|$|The {{first set}} fees {{appeared}} in 1627 for letters sent to Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulouse and Dijon. As {{with the rest}} of Europe, stamps did not exist in France at that time and mail was paid for by the recipient. The first map of post roads was published in 1632 and a book compiling lists of roads and inns including distances and fees to be paid was released in 1707. A new edition was released every two years until 1859. The country already had 623 coaching inns in 1632 and the figure reached 800 {{at the beginning of the}} 18th century. A ferme générale was created for mail services in 1672, which meant that postal services started to be subject to <b>taxation.</b> Tax <b>officers</b> progressively bought private postal companies and university envoys became subjects to the ferme générale in 1719. International treaties regarding postal services were signed with neighbouring countries under Louis XIV.|$|R
5000|$|Making alcohol at {{home was}} very common during Prohibition. Stores sold grape {{concentrate}} with warning labels that listed the steps that should be avoided to prevent the juice from fermenting into wine. Some drugstores sold [...] "medical wine" [...] with around a 22% alcohol content. In order to justify the sale, the wine was given a medicinal taste. Home-distilled hard liquor was called bathtub gin in northern cities, and moonshine in rural areas of Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. Homebrewing good hard liquor was easier than brewing good beer. Since selling privately distilled alcohol was illegal and bypassed government <b>taxation,</b> law enforcement <b>officers</b> relentlessly pursued manufacturers. In response, bootleggers modified their cars and trucks by enhancing the engines and suspensions to make faster vehicles that, they presumed, would improve their chances of outrunning and escaping agents of the Bureau of Prohibition, commonly called [...] "revenue agents" [...] or [...] "revenuers". These cars became known as [...] "moonshine runners" [...] or shine runners". Shops were also known {{to participate in the}} underground liquor market, by loading their stocks with ingredients for liquors, including bénédictine, vermouth, scotch mash, and even ethyl alcohol, which anyone could purchase legally.|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: Perhaps like {{no other}} king of Scots’ reign, the long rule of the second and last Bruce monarch, David II (1329 - 71), has left {{striking}} proof that parliament or general council could be an extremely difficult and disputatious arena for the crown. These were assemblies which could be fueled at once by the factional agendas and animosities of king and key magnates {{as well as by}} the developing political outlook of the three estates. Admittedly, much of the evolving nature of this point of governmental contact sprang from David’s unpredictable and dramatic personal circumstances. 1 Not only did David accede to the throne as a child faced with a lengthy minority but on at least two occasions following the king’s capture in battle against England in 1346 a Scottish parliament would record a point-blank refusal to countenance his plans for the admission of an English Prince to the Scottish succession. Faced instead with the treaty obligation of paying off an onerous ransom of 100, 000 merks to Edward III in just ten years, David - after his release in 1357 - could be said to have found himself repeatedly in front of his subjects with crown-in-hand in search of revenues and approval of his diplomacy. 2 In return for his subjects’ ‘consent and assent’ over these matters parliament or council seemed able, throughout the 1360 s especially, to extract numerous statutory concessions with regard to their expectations and concerns for royal justice, the behaviour of crown <b>officers,</b> <b>taxation</b> assessment and expenditure, the royal demesne, prise, hospitality and foreign relations. Robert Rait, reading all of this in the fragmentary extant record of acts, was thus convinced that David was a ‘worthless man’ whose reign was an opportunity for ‘the development of a Parliamentary influence comparable to that exercised by the English Parliament in the later fourteenth century’: in Rait’s view, through the exchange of redress of subjects’ grievances for regular subsidy, by 1371 ‘Parliament or General Council succeeded in placing important restrictions upon the power of the sovereign…. [and] the constitutional progress of the reign of David II was therefore the development of baronial rule over a weak monarch…the only possible leaders made an honest effort to prevent the king from wasting the revenues required for administrative purposes and f...|$|R
6000|$|No sooner did {{the boat}} of the port-captain {{return to the}} shore {{with the news that}} the strange ship had arrived with my Lord Chatterino, my Lady Chatterissa and Dr. Reasono than there was a general burst of joy along the strand. In a very short time the king--alias his eldest first cousin of the male gender--ordered the usual {{compliments}} to be paid to his distinguished subjects. A deputation of young lords the hopes of Leaphigh came off to receive their colleague; whilst a bevy of beautiful maidens of noble birth crowded around the smiling and graceful Chatterissa, gladdening her heart with their caressing manners and felicitations. The noble pair left us in separate boats, each attended by an appropriate escort. We overlooked the little neglect of forgetting to take leave of us, for joy had quite set them both beside themselves. Next came a long procession composed of high numbers, all of the [...] "brown-study color." [...] These learned and dignified persons were a deputation from the academy, which had sent forth no less than forty of its number to receive Dr. Reasono. The meeting between these loving friends of monikinity and of knowledge, was conducted on the most approved principles of reason. Each section (there are forty in the academy of Leaphigh) made an address, to all of which the Doctor returned suitable replies, always using exactly the same sentiments, but varying the subject by transpositions, as dictionaries are known to be composed by the ingenious combinations of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet. Dr. Reasono withdrew with his coadjutors, to my surprise paying not a whit more attention to Captain Poke and myself, than would be paid in any highly-civilized country of Christendom, on a similar occasion, by a collection of the learned, to the accidental presence of two monkeys. I thought this augured badly, and began to feel as became Sir John Goldencalf, Bart., of Householder Hall, in the kingdom of Great Britain, when my sensations were nipped in the bud by the arrival of the officers of registration and circulation. It was the duty of the latter to give us the proper passports to enter into and to circulate within the country, after the former had properly enregistered our numbers and colors, {{in such a way as}} to bring us within the reach of <b>taxation.</b> The <b>officer</b> of registration was very expeditious from long practice. He decided, at once, that I formed a new class by myself; of which, of course, I was No. 1. The captain and his two mates formed another, Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Bob had a class also to himself, and the honors of No. 1; and the crew formed a fresh class, being numbered according to height, as the register deemed their merits to be altogether physical. Next came the important point of color, on which depended the quality of the class or caste, the numbers merely indicating our respective stations in the particular divisions. After a good deal of deliberation, and many interrogatories, I was enregistered as No. 1, flesh-color. Noah as No. 1, sea-water color, and his mates 2 and 3, accordingly. Bob as No. 1, smut-color, and the crew as Nos. 1, 2, 3, etc., tar-color. The officer now called upon an assistant to come forth with a sort of knitting-needle heated red-hot, in order to affix the official stamp to each in succession. Luckily for us all, Noah happened to be the first to whom the agent of the stamp-office applied, to uncase and to prepare for the operation. The result was one of those bursts of eloquent and logical vituperation, and of remonstrating outcries, to which any new personal exaction never failed to give birth in the sealer. His discourse on this occasion might be divided into the several following heads, all of which were very ingeniously embellished by the usual expletives and imagery:--"He was not a beast to be branded like a horse, nor a slave to be treated like a Congo nigger; he saw no use in applying the marks to men, who were sufficiently distinguished from monkeys already; Sir John had a handle before his name, and if he liked it, he might carry his name behind his body, by way of counterpoise, but for his part, he wanted no outriggers of the sort, being satisfied with plain Noah Poke; he was a republican, and it was anti-republican for a man to carry about with him graven images; he thought it might be even flying in the face of the Scriptures, or what was worse, turning his back on them; he said that the Walrus had her name, in good legible characters on her starn, and that might answer for both of them; he protested, d--n his eyes, that he wouldn't be branded like a thief; he incontinently wished the keeper of the privy seal to the d---l; he insisted there was no use in the practice, unless one threw all aback, and went starn foremost into society, a rudeness at which human natur' revolted; he knew a man in Stunin'tun who had five names, and he should like to know what they would do with him, if this practice should come into fashion there; he had no objection to a little paint, but no red-hot knitting-needle should make acquaintance with his flesh, so long as he walked his quarter-deck." ...|$|R
