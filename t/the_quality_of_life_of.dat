5|$|As a landlord, Coke was a {{firm believer}} in the right and moral {{obligation}} of a landowner to improve <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> those living on his estates. The roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century; the landlord was to provide fields, roads and buildings, while the tenant would provide the seed, implements and manual labour. Coke's estate included 54 farms when he inherited it, with excellent farm output. There were, however, significant debts {{as a result of his}} uncle's work on Holkham Hall, with the interest alone being £4,000 a year. He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates, and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell, appointed by Coke's uncle, retired in 1782, Coke failed to replace him until 1816. This replacement was Francis Blaikie, a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield. Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better, but often struggled to deal with Coke. Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural, on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester. It wasn't until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of this, after receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights. Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale, finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is {{a multidimensional}} concept, which is best {{expressed}} by the subjective well-being. Evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is <b>the</b> basis for measuring the well-being, and the determination of factors that determine <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>quality</b> is <b>the</b> basis for its improvement Objective. To evaluate and assess the determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perceived <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> group distinguishing features which characterize demographic and socioeconomic factors. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of {{a representative sample of}} the population in Serbia aged over 20 years (9479 examinees). <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was {{expressed by the}} perception of well-being (pleasure <b>of</b> <b>life).</b> Data on the examinees (demographic and socioeconomic characteristics) were collected by using a questionnaire for adults of each household.

5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class.

He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen.

The objective of this paper was to examine the relationships between proactive coping and <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in people in late adulthood. <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was assessed using the Polish version of the CASP- 19. Participants and procedure The research included 88 individuals (76 women and 12 men), aged from 60 to 85 years (M = 69. 5, SD = 6. 74). The following tools were used: The Proactive Coping Inventory, developed by Greenglass, Schwarzer and Taubert (Pasikowski’s adaptation), and the scale for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> called CASP- 19, of Higgs, Hyde, Wiggins and Blane (developed by the authors of this paper).
