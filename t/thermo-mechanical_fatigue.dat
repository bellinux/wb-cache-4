40|$|Due to both {{significant}} primary loads (weight, pressure) {{and thermal}} transients, important supporting structures (bedspring, deck…) subjected to <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigues</b> require that periodical inspections {{are carried out}} in nuclear power plant. The bedspring and the deck are complex welded structures of very restricted access; the ability to reliably detect and locate defects like cracks is therefore a difficult challenge. Ultrasonic testing is a well-recognized non-invasive technic which exhibits high characterization performances in homogeneous media (steel). However, its capabilities are hampered when operating in heterogeneous and anisotropic austenitic welds because of deviation and splitting of the ultrasonic beam. In order to rise to this important challenge, a model-based method is proposed, which takes into account a prior knowledge corresponding to the welding procedure specifications (TIG welding, sequence of passes…) that condition the austenitic grains orientation within the weld and thus the wave propagation. The topological imaging method implemented is a differential approach which, compares signals from the reference defect-free medium to the inspected medium. It relies on combinations of two computed ultrasonic fields, one forward and one adjoint. Under the Born approximation, the investigated method virtually and successfully back-focuses the ultrasound residue towards any of the perturbations (defects) in the numerical model. However, when multiple reflections occurs, the conventional topological energy method fails at localizing the defect. This paper presents a new approach for addressing multiple reflexions.

This model considers a quadratic yield criterion to define the elasticity domain. It allows the determination of two inelastic strain mechanisms resulting from two stress states which {{can be related to}} the typical continuous cyclic softening of the tempered martensitic steels.

40|$|Integrated power {{semiconductors}} {{are often}} used for applications with cyclic on-chip power dissipation. This leads to repetitive self-heating and <b>thermo-mechanical</b> stress, causing <b>fatigue</b> on the on-chip metallization and possibly destruction by short circuits. Because of this, an accurate simulation of the thermo-mechanical stress is needed already during the design phase to ensure that lifetime requirements are met. However, a detailed thermo mechanical simulation of the device, including the on-chip metallization is prohibitively time-consuming due to its complex structure, typically consisting of many thin metal lines with thousands of vias. This paper introduces a two-step approach as a solution for this problem. First, a simplified but fast simulation is performed to identify the device parts with the highest stress. After, precise simulations are carried out only for them. The applicability of this method is verified experimentally for LDMOS transistors with different metal configurations.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The {{titanium}} alloys have found wide application in the aerospace, biomedical and automotive industries. Soaring fuel prices and environmental concerns are the fundamental drivers that intensify the demand situation for titanium. From a machining viewpoint, {{one of the}} challenges companies face, is achieving high material removal rates while maintaining the form and function of the part. The ultimate aim for a machining business remains to make parts quickly. Conventional cutting speeds range from 30 to 100 m/min in the machining of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Milling this alloy faster however is challenging. Although titanium is becoming a material of choice, many of the same qualities that enhance titanium‟s appeal for most applications also contribute to its being {{one of the most difficult}} materials to machine. The author explored the potential for Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) inserts in high speed milling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, by trying to understand the fundamental causes of tool failure. The objective was to achieve an order of magnitude increase in tool life, while machining at high speed, simply by reducing some of the failure mechanisms through different cutting strategies. Tool wear is described as a <b>thermo-mechanical</b> high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> phenomenon. The capability of a higher material removal per tool life is achieved in the case of PCD inserts compared to Tungsten carbide (WC). The average surface roughness produced was relatively low. The collected chips were also analyzed. The work demonstrated progress over the performance reported in current literature. The work confirms that there is a region where a sufficiently high temperature in the cutting zone may contribute to extended tool life, provided that the tool material can withstand these extreme conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design for}} reliability of a sintered silver structure in a power electronic module based on the computational approach that composed of high fidelity analysis, reduced order modelling, numerical risk analysis, and optimisation. The methodology was demonstrated on sintered silver interconnect sandwiched between silicon carbide chip and copper substrate in a power electronic module. In particular, sintered silver reliability due to thermal fatigue material degradation {{is one of the}} main concerns. Thermo-mechanical behaviour of the power module sintered silver joint structure is simulated by finite element analysis for cyclic temperature loading profile in order to capture the strain distribution. The discussion was on methods for approximate reduced order modelling based on interpolation techniques using Kriging and radial basis functions. The reduced order modelling approach uses prediction data for the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> behaviour. The <b>fatigue</b> lifetime of the sintered silver interconnect and the warpage of the interconnect layer was particular interest in this study. The reduced order models were used for the analysis of the effect of design uncertainties on the reliability of the sintered silver layer.

In general, the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> is affected by {{various factors such as}} thermal expansion/contraction, elasto-plastic/creep deformation, softening by overaging, dynamic recovery, damaging and cracking. Multi-step finite element simulation techniques have provided an effective way of assessing the local damaging behavior of silicon particles, along with extracting the contribution from creep. Although {{the size and shape of}} the silicon particles in the material with a higher solidification rate are similar to those of a slowly cooled material, it exhibits superior <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> property together with a smaller secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS, hereinafter). Since the difference in the stress-strain hysteresis loops between the two materials has vanished when the softening by overaging is almost finished, the observed difference in the thermo-mechanical properties is attributed to age-hardenability rather than the SDAS. The effects of damaging at the silicon particles to this difference are also suggested. In fact, damaged silicon particles have been observed extensively from an early stage of the thermo-mechanical loading, then forming fatigue cracks by the linkage of the damages. It has been clarified by the simulation that interfacial debonding is likely to occur rather than particle cracking in the materials used. The simulation provides valuable insights into the understanding of the spatial distribution of damage in the eutectic region. The simulation has also enabled to assess the contribution of the creep deformation, indicating that medium to high cycle fatigues are significantly affected by it...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{forging dies}} are {{affected}} by different failure mechanisms, which can mutually influence the total damage and are caused by the application of cyclic mechanical and thermal load; wear, plastic deformation, creep and <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> (TMF) are the principal actors in generating the damage and therefore determining the service life of the dies. Focusing the attention on the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> phenomena it can be recognized that it involves complex experimentation and long testing runs. A survey of the literature clarifies that testing techniques consider a constant or slowly varying temperature of the specimen and temperature distribution in the cross section is usually uniform. These conditions are really far from those present in the hot forging dies, where temperature changes reach some hundreds of °C in few seconds and a thermal gradient is present. Aimed to investigate <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> in hot forging process a new test has been proposed suitable to include the whole set of variables present in the forging process. The paper presents a dual approach to investigate <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue,</b> leading to a simple interpretation of the experimentation (heuristic model) and to a more advanced theoretical model based {{on the concept of}} the damage per cycle.

A heuristic model, able to estimate TMF life as a function of maximum temperature cycle, minimum temperature cycle and the ratio between equivalent stress and yield strength at corresponding temperature, has been obtained using Surface Modelling (RSM).

40|$|The {{soldering}} {{process of}} interconnecting crystalline silicon solar cells to form photovoltaic (PV) module {{is a key}} manufacturing process. However, during the soldering process, stress is induced in the solar cell solder joints and remains in the joint as residual stress after soldering. Furthermore, during the module service life time, thermo-mechanical degradation of the solder joints occurs due to thermal cycling of the joints which induce stress, creep strain and strain energy. The resultant effect of damage on the solder joint is premature failure, hence shortened fatigue life. This study seeks to determine accumulated <b>thermo-mechanical</b> damage and <b>fatigue</b> life of solder interconnection in solar cell assembly under thermo-mechanical cycling conditions. In this investigation, finite element modelling (FEM) and simulations are carried out {{in order to determine}} nonlinear degradation of SnAgCu solder joints. The degradation of the solder material is simulated using Garofalo-Arrhenius creep model. A three dimensional (3 D) geometric model is subjected to six accelerated thermal cycles (ATCs) utilising IEC 61215 standard for photovoltaic panels. The results demonstrate that induced stress, strain and strain energy impacts the solder joints during operations. Furthermore, the larger the accumulated creep strain and creep strain energy in the joints, the shorter the fatigue life. This indicates that creep strain and creep strain energy in the solder joints significantly impacts the thermo-mechanical reliability of the assembly joints. Regions of solder joint with critical stress, strain and strain energy values including their distribution are determined. Analysis of results demonstrates that creep energy density is a better parameter than creep strain in predicting interconnection fatigue life. The use of six ATCs yields significant data which enable better understanding of the response of the solder joints to the induced loads. Moreover, information obtained from this study can be used for improved design and better-quality fabrication of solder interconnections in solar cell assembly for enhanced thermo-mechanical reliability...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrical shells {{have large}} {{industrial}} applications ranging from pressure vessels, engine cylinders and hydraulic chambers to chemical and {{power plants and}} they are typically subjected to severe mechanical or thermo-mechanical environmental conditions. The fatigue life, pressure and thermal load bearing capacities of thick-walled cylinders can be considerably improved by inducing near the bore compressive residual hoop stresses. Shrink-fit and autofrettage processes have been effectively applied to generate favorable compressive residual stresses. The main goal of this research study is to fundamentally investigate the compound cylinders subjected to autofrettage and shrink-fit processes and develop new design processing technique and practical design optimization strategies to enhance their fatigue life under cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. First, the residual stresses of compound cylinders subjected to different combinations of shrink-fit and autofrettage processes have been evaluated using the developed finite element model in the ANSYS environment. The stresses due to different cyclic thermo-mechanical loads have also been calculated for the different combinations of compound cylinders considering the fully coupled thermo-elastic finite element model. To validate the finite element model, an experimental setup {{has been designed to}} measure the temperature history at three different locations through the wall thickness and also hoop strain at the outer surface of a two-layer compound cylinder under internal quasi-static and cyclic thermal loads. The experimental results have then been compared with those obtained from the finite element model. Moreover, to compare the performance of compound cylinders under different <b>thermo-mechanical</b> loads, the <b>fatigue</b> life due to cyclic pressure, cyclic thermal pulses and cyclic combined thermo-mechanical pulses has been calculated using ASME code for high pressure vessel. Next, to enhance the residual stress distribution along the wall thickness of the cylinder, a new double autofrettage process has been introduced. In the proposed double autofrettage process, an outer autofrettage cycle is performed prior to a standard inner autofrettage cycle. This can provide an increase in the beneficial compressive residual stresses at the near bore area of the cylinder while decreasing the detrimental tensile residual stress at the outer part of the cylinder. The proposed process has then been utilized to construct new combinations of autofrettage, shrink-fit and double autofrettage processes. The residual stress distribution through the thickness and fatigue life of these new combinations have been evaluated and compared with those based on conventional combinations of shrink-fit and autofrettage processes. Finally, a practical design optimization methodology has been developed to identify the optimal configuration of autofrettaged and shrink-fitted cylinders. Optimization problems based on the high-fidelity finite element model is computationally very expensive and may not render accurate optimum results. Considering this in the presented research, design of experiment (DOE) and response surface method (RSM) have been used in combination with the finite element model to create smooth response surface functions which can accurately describe the behavior of the residual hoop stresses with respect to the change of design variables. The developed response surface functions have been effectively utilized in the design optimization problems to simultaneously maximize the residual compressive hoop stress and minimize the residual tensile hoop stress through the thickness of the compound cylinder. Nonlinear mathematical programming technique based on the powerful sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm has been used in combination with the genetic algorithm (GA) in order to accurately capture the global optimal solutions. At the end, the residual hoop stress distribution and fatigue life of the optimum configurations for each combination of autofrettage and shrink-fit processes have been evaluated and compared. ...|$|R

40|$|High {{strength}} nickel-base superalloys {{have been}} used in turbine blades for many years because of their superior performance at high temperatures. In such environments superalloys have limited oxidation and corrosion resistance and to solve this problem, protective coatings are deposited on the surface. The positive effect of coatings is based on protecting the surface zone in contact with hot gas atmosphere with a thermodynamically stable oxide layer that acts as a diffusion barrier. During service life, mechanical properties of metallic coatings can be changed due to the significant interdiffusion between substrate and coating. There are also other degradation mechanisms that affect nickel-base superalloys such as low cycle fatigue, <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> and creep. The focus of this work is on a study of low cycle fatigue and out-of-phase <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> behaviour of three uncoated and coated nickel-base superalloys. Polycrystalline IN 792 and two single crystals CMSX- 4 and SCB were coated with four different coatings; an overlay coating AMDRY 997 (NiCoCrAlYTa), a platinum aluminide modified diffusion coating RT 22 and two innovative coatings with a NiW interdiffusion barrier in the interface called IC 1 and IC 3. A low cycle fatigue and <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> device was designed and set-up to simulate service loading of turbine blades and vanes. The low cycle fatigue tests were run at 500 oC and 900 oC while the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests were run between 250 oC and 900 oC. To simulate long service life, some coated specimens were exposed at 1050 oC for 2000 h before the tests. The main conclusions are that the presence of the coatings is, in most cases, detrimental to LCF lives of the superalloys at 500 oC while the coatings do improve the LCF lives of the superalloys at 900 oC. Under TMF loading conditions, the coatings have negative effect on the lifetime of IN 792. On single crystals, they are found to improve TMF life of the superalloys, especially at lower strains. The tests also indicate that long-term aging influences the fatigue and fracture behaviour of coated superalloys by oxidation and diffusion mechanisms when compared to non-aged specimens. The aged specimens exhibit longer life in some cases and shorter life during other test conditions.

The first step consists of modelling the nonlinear cyclic behavior and tension/compression strong dissymmetry of grey cast iron. The proposed model {{is based on}} the introduction of a second-order induced damage tensor. From the analysis of the damage mechanisms, a fatigue criterion based on the dissipated energy per cycle is proposed...|$|E

An increase in roughness and in β→γ′ transformation rate depends similarly on maximum temperature, holding time at maximum temperature and applied stress. Moreover, {{the evolution of the}} interdiffusion zone (IDZ) is analyzed by making the distinction between two layers, according to the major phases observed within these layers, namely β-(Ni,Pt) Al and γ′-Ni 3 Al. This distinction highlighted that the respective thickness evolution of these two layers are sensitive to each parameter of TMF tests with similar increase in evolution rate when increasing time, temperature, as well as applied stress. The distinctive features of phase transformation are finally discussed together with localization of phase transformation and measured evolution of phase transformation within the external coating and β- and γ′-IDZ layer thicknesses under thermal and <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue.</b> This analysis leads to a conclusion that grain boundaries within the external coating as well as interfaces, between thermally grown oxide, external coating, and IDZ, respectively, {{play a major role in}} diffusion, phase transformation, and microstructure evolution of typical platinum-modified nickel-aluminide coating...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{selected}} {{parts of}} the current literature relevant to <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>fatigue</b> mechanisms in eutectic tin-lead solder, and suggests a general outline to account for some observed failures. The field {{is found to be}} complex. One recent experimental study finds some failure modes to be sensitive to joint geometry. Attempts to extrapolate from test environments to service environments have had only limited success. Much work remains to be done before fatigue failures in this material can be considered as under practical control...|$|E
