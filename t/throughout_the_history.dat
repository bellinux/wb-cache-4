5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E

Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors.

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Multiple escape {{attempts}} were made <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to {{keep a close eye}} on others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E

In 2005, a star was added above the badge to signify the first 10 League of Ireland titles won by the club. After the takeover of the club by the supporters, black became the club's third official colour in recognition of the loss of Glenmalure Park. It was also decided that the number 12 would no longer be worn by any Shamrock Rovers player and instead would represent the club's supporters.|$|E
5|$|The {{exclusion}} of professionals caused several controversies <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> {{of the modern}} Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when {{it was discovered that}} he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.|$|E
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
