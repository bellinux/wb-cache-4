40|$|In 1985 the EU Agricultural Policy {{recognised}} {{the negative}} impact that intensification was having on biodiversity across the agrarian landscape. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is the current iteration of Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) {{with the aim of}} conserving farmland biodiversity. Despite the implementation of ES many farmland species still record declining populations, which has prompted criticism that ES is failing to fulfil its goals and is poor value for money. This study aims to evaluate the impact of an ES scheme on the composition and species richness of vascular plants at a farm in East Prawle, South Devon. In 2002 a survey of the East Prawle site was undertaken along field margins, which were divided into contiguous 30 m transects spanning the entire boundary of each field. In 2014 this study used the same methodology to repeat the surveys. Arable and grassland fields managed under combined Entry Level (ELS) and Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) were contrasted with similar control fields under conventional management. Ellenberg values were applied as bio-indicators of the sites fertility (N) status. Each aspect was analysed for temporal comparisons between 2002 and 2014. Over the 12 years a significant decline (P< 0. 05) in species richness occurred across both the <b>Test</b> <b>farm,</b> managed under ES and the conventionally managed Control farm. Nonetheless in both 2002 and 2014 species richness on the <b>Test</b> <b>farm</b> was found to be significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than at the Control. Evaluation of land use between 2002 and 2014 disclosed no significant change (P< 0. 05) in species richness on any land type at the <b>Test</b> <b>farm</b> but a significant decline (P< 0. 05) in species richness on arable land at the Control farm. This resulted in arable land on the <b>Test</b> <b>farm</b> being of significantly greater (P< 0. 05) species richness tha n on the Control. Of particular interest is the reversion of arable land to permanent pasture as specified under ES. This arable reversion is of significantly (P< 0. 05) greater species richness than arable reversion on the Control farm, which is part of rotation. Between 2002 and 2014 the <b>Test</b> <b>farm</b> experienced a significant reduction (P< 0. 05) in Ellenberg fertility value, believed to be due to the ES stipulation for decreased fertiliser applications. As a result three species (Plantago lanceolata, Vicia sativa, & Senecio jacobaea) with Ellenberg values of four, increased by over 20 percentage points. There are notable composition changes on both farms between 2002 and 2014 however this study shows that ES has not caused increased species richness, or benefited plants of conservation concern, or established the target species rich maritime grassland. The study recognises that ES is unlikely to produce species rich habitats within the 10 year duration of most ES agreements and emphasises the need for extended durations as well as frequent monitoring to establish trends at field, farm and landscape scale...|$|E

Under such circumstances, heavy losses of young calves occur. This is the situation presently on these farms. The current {{study was conducted in}} Bahati division of Nakuru district over a period of 3 years. Out of 120 smallholder farmers randomly visited and interviewed, 60 of them were selected to participate in the trial, based on whether they have dairy cattle and willing to collaborate. The selected farmers were trained on data recording and provided with a heart-girth measuring tape, a spring balance (25 kg), a 10 -litre plastic bucket (for feed weighing), a 1 -litre graduated jug (for measuring milk) and a record book. They were then divided into two groups (Control and test) of 30 each. Control group was asked to continue with their ordinary calf management, where supplementation was not offered. Test farmers were asked to strictly follow the research calf-feeding schedule where Napier grass cv Bana was fed as a basal diet and supplemented with protein rich forages (Lucernne; Sweet potato vines cv Munsinya; Desmodium cv Green leaf and fodder shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban). Parameters of study were growth rate, mortality, morbidity and dynamics. The collected data was stored in MS-excel and later subjected to appropriate statistical models (SAS) to established the calf performance difference between the 2 farm groups and livestock production systems. The results showed that calves in <b>test</b> <b>farms</b> performed better (370 g/d) compared to those in control farms (307 g/d) (P< 0. 01). The study further revealed that calves supplemented with an assortment of protein rich forages showed a rapid body weight gain (375 and 417 g/d) compared to those offered SPV as a sole protein supplement (345 g/d) (P< 0. 05). It was further observed that the overall female calf mortality in zero grazing <b>test</b> <b>farms</b> was low (6 %) compared to semi-zero and free grazing <b>test</b> <b>farms</b> (15 and 20 %, respectively) (P< 0. 05). In the same farms mortality of male and female calves was different (P< 0. 05).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Machinery complement information is used in farm simulation models such as the FLIPSIM model when studying of the impacts of agricultural policies on representative farms. Since acquiring machinery complement data for FLIPSIM simulations is a lengthy process, it would be beneficial if researchers could estimate the machinery complement based on information provided by the producer panels. The purpose of this analysis was to develop and test an econometric model for estimating the machinery complement for representative crop farms. Machinery complement data was collected from 31 representative farms. These data were used to estimate Ordinary Least Squares regression models for 16 machinery complement categories for the current market value, purchase price, replacement cost, average economic life, and average age. Statistical tests were used to compare the actual and predicted machinery complements for eight <b>test</b> <b>farms.</b> The predicted and actual machinery complements for the eight <b>test</b> <b>farms</b> were simulated with their respective panel farm data for alternative farm policies using FLIPSIM. The results of the simulations were compared by testing the differences between the means of key output variables. Stochastic dominance rankings of the policies for the two machinery complements were also used. The results of the study were: Statistical tests indicated that the regression models for the three irrigation type categories, "trucks," "feed related," and the "harvesting - cotton" category would predict well and the "pickups and lawn tractors," 'harvesting - other," "fuevnurse tanks and trailers," and 'other machinery" categories would not predict as well as other categories. The statistical tests used to compare the actual and predicted machinery complements indicated that the regression models predicted well for the eight <b>test</b> <b>farms.</b> The <b>test</b> on the means of the key output variables for the predicted vs. actual machinery complement policy simulation indicated that using an estimated a machinery complement can result in statistically different outcomes. The stochastic dominance ranking of the policy alternatives indicated that six out of the eight farms ranked the policies in the same order when simulating with either the actual or predicted machinery complement. Because using a predicted machinery complement can result in statistically different outcomes when performing a farm level simulation, one may need to simulate using the actual machinery complement. However, if the object of the farm simulation is to rank policy alternatives, a predicted machinery complement can be used...|$|R
