The budget {{is currently}} estimated to be between $8.5 and $14 billion, and produce power at 6 to 8 cents/kWh. This prediction is based on <b>three</b> <b>assumptions</b> that appear to have never been met in operation: that the rebuild will be completed on-budget, that the system will operate at an average capacity utilization of 82%, and that the Ontario taxpayer will pay 100% of any cost overruns. Although Darlington Units 1, 3 and 4 have operated with an average lifetime annual capacity factor of 85% and Unit 2 with a capacity factor of 78%, refurbished units at Pickering and Bruce have lifetime capacity factors between 59 and 69%. This includes periods of several years while the units were shut down for the retubing and refurbishing. In 2009, Bruce A Units 3 and 4 had capacity factors of 80.5% and 76.7%, respectively, in a year when they had a major Vacuum Building outage.|$|E
500|$|However, {{historian}} Kenneth R. Bartlett notes that, {{in contrast}} to his Renaissance-era successors, [...] "his reliance on such elements as divine providence links Villani closely with the medieval vernacular chronicle tradition." [...] In recurring themes made implicit through significant events described in his Cronica, Villani also emphasized <b>three</b> <b>assumptions</b> about the relationship of sin and morality to historical events, these being that excess brings disaster, that forces {{of right and wrong}} are in constant struggle, and that events are directly influenced by the will of God.|$|E
500|$|The cyclol {{hypothesis}} {{is the first}} structural model of a folded, globular protein. [...] It was developed by Dorothy Wrinch in the late 1930s, and was based on <b>three</b> <b>assumptions.</b> [...] Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these crosslinks are covalent analogs of non-covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups. [...] These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds. [...] Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol fabrics (Figure 3). [...] These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. [...] Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges. [...] Such [...] "closed cyclol" [...] molecules have not been observed either.|$|E

Torpedo launches from steerable torpedo tubes meet the three stated assumptions well.

When the target range was not known, torpedo launches requiring large gyro angles were not recommended.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{sensitivity}} of ion concentration distribution models to <b>three</b> key model <b>assumptions,</b> the pore-size distribution of clay media, {{the distance of}} closest approach of ions to the clay surface, and the accessibility of sub-nanometer-wide clay mineral interlayer spaces to anions, was explored by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for swelling and non-swelling clay materials. Our calculations show that all <b>three</b> model <b>assumptions</b> significantly impact values predicted for the anion accessible porosity. As a consequence, macroscopic measurements of anion exclusion in clay media cannot be used to test any of the <b>three</b> model <b>assumptions</b> independently of the two others. Information gained at the nanoscale,in particular, a detailed characterization of pore size distribution, is necessary to develop accurate predictive models of the anion accessible porosity of clay media...|$|R

6000|$|But {{is there}} any sound {{foundation}} for the <b>three</b> <b>assumptions</b> involved here? Firstly, that the evaporation from the Mediterranean, as a whole, {{is much greater than}} that from the Atlantic under corresponding parallels; secondly, that the rainfall over the Mediterranean makes up for evaporation less than it does over the Atlantic; and thirdly, supposing these two questions answered affirmatively: Are not these sources of loss in the Mediterranean fully covered by the prodigious quantity of fresh water which is poured into it by great rivers and submarine springs? Consider that the water of the Ebro, the Rhine, the Po, the Danube, the Don, the Dnieper, and the Nile, all flow directly or indirectly into the Mediterranean; that the volume of fresh water which they pour into it is so enormous that fresh water may sometimes be baled up {{from the surface of the}} sea off the Delta of the Nile, while the land is not yet in sight; that the water of the Black Sea is half fresh, and that a current of three or four miles an hour constantly streams from it Mediterraneanwards through the Bosphorus;--consider, in addition, that no fewer than ten submarine springs of fresh water are known to burst up in the Mediterranean, some of them so large that Admiral Smyth calls them [...] "subterranean rivers of amazing volume and force"; and it would seem, on the face of the matter, that the sun must have enough to do to keep the level of the Mediterranean down; and that, possibly, we may have to seek for the cause of the small superiority in saline contents of the Mediterranean water in some condition other than solar evaporation.|$|E
