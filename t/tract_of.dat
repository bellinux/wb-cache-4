5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells in the oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, the oceans, the intestinal <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> animals, and soils.|$|E

Clark served as the first chairman of the Clarksville, Indiana, board of trustees. Clark was unable to retain title to his landholdings. At the end of his life, he was poor, in ill health, and frequently intoxicated.|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{plankton}} stratigraphy of the subsurface Upper Cretaceous-Palaeogene succession of theEast Bahariya Concession based on planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. The examination of the cuttings from ﬁve wells: AQSA- 1 X, KARMA-E- 1 X, KARMA- 3 X, KARMA-NW- 1 X and KARMA-NW- 5 X is biostratigraphically evaluated. It is possible to identify the planktonic foraminifera {{as well as the}} calcareous nannofossil biozones. The analyses of calcareous nannofossils revealed the presence of several hiatuses. Information obtained from well data such as seismic facies analysis for the studied area has enabled classiﬁcation of the Upper Cretaceous Palaeogene succession into ﬁve major 2 nd order depositional sequences, separated by four major depositional sequence boundaries (SB 1, SB 2, SB 3 and SB 4). The Upper Cretaceous-Palaeogene succession in the East Bahariya is dividedinto 17 systems tracts. These systems tracts are: 7 System <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> probable Cenomanian age, (the sequence stratigraphic framework as well as the cycles and system <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> the Cenomanian Bahariya Formation match well with thoseof CATUNEANUet al., 2006); 4 System <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> Turonianage, 2 System <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> Campanian-Maastrichtian ageand 4 System <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> Eocene age. </p...|$|R

Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.|$|E

Nyungwe, the largest remaining <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> forest, contains 200 species of tree as well as orchids and begonias. Vegetation in the Volcanoes National Park is mostly bamboo and moorland, with small areas of forest. By contrast, Akagera has a savanna ecosystem in which acacia dominates the flora. There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including Markhamia lutea and Eulophia guineensis.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E

Intragastric administration of C. difficile to infant hamsters resulted in multiplication of the organism in the intestinal <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> animals 4 to 12 days old; hamsters younger or older were resistant to C. difficile intestinal colonization.
