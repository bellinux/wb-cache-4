5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brain,</b> {{although}} {{protected by}} the blood-brain barrier, can be affected by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Infection may be of the meninges (meningitis), <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> matter (encephalitis), or within <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> matter (such as a cerebral abscess). Rare prion diseases including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant, and kuru may also affect <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of each part of <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any {{electrical}} current generates a magnetic field; neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields, and in functional magnetoencephalography the current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution. Tractography uses MRI and image analysis to create 3D {{images of the}} nerve tracts of <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Connectograms give a graphical representation of the neural connections of <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E

50|$|According to {{researchers}} at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, the physical structure of <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> {{of humans and}} cats is very similar. <b>The</b> human <b>brain</b> and <b>the</b> cat <b>brain</b> both have cerebral cortices with similar lobes.|$|R
50|$|Besides the amygdala, {{there are}} other neuropathological areas of {{degeneration}} as well; <b>the</b> overall <b>brain</b> volume can also be measured. Research shows that <b>the</b> overall <b>brain</b> volume is not statistically significantly different between patients with bipolar disorder and patients with schizophrenia, except when making comparisons in the intracranial volume. A larger intracranial volume is present in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> in bipolar disorder, but no variation occurs in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of people with schizophrenia.|$|R
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> can {{manifest}} {{in a wide}} variety of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface}} of the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} clindamycin in a murine model of toxoplasmic encephalitis using direct intracerebral inoculation. Clindamycin reduced mortality from 40 % in normal mice and 100 % in cortisone-treated mice to 0 % in both groups. Although {{we were unable to}} document appreciable levels of clindamycin in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of infected mice, the histological features of cerebral infection were markedly altered. The formation of large numbers of cysts and the intense inflammatory response seen in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of normal mice and the unchecked infection and tissue necrosis in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of cortisone-treated mice were absent in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of clindamycin-treated mice. Enumeration of cysts in <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of mice 10 weeks after infection revealed a significantly lower number in the clindamycin-treated mice. Spread of infection to other organs was also decreased during clindamycin administration. These observations suggest that clindamycin may have a role in the therapy of toxoplasmic encephalitis...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>brains</b> {{of mammals}} such as {{carnivores}} and primates contain developed structures {{not found in}} <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of mice. Uncovering the physiological importance, developmental mechanisms and evolution of these structures using carnivores and primates would greatly contribute {{to our understanding of}} <b>the</b> human <b>brain</b> and its diseases. Although the anatomical and physiological properties of <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of carnivores and primates have been intensively examined, molecular investigations are still limited. Recently, genetic techniques that can be applied to carnivores and primates have been explored, and molecules whose expression patterns correspond to these structures were reported. Furthermore, to investigate the functional importance of these molecules, rapid and efficient genetic manipulation methods were established by applying electroporation to gyrencephalic carnivore ferrets. In this article, I review recent advances in molecular investigations of <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of carnivores and primates, mainly focusing on ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) ...|$|R
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} found in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E

5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146).
