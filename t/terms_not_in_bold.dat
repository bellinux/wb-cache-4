30|$|Moving {{away from}} merely {{focusing}} on effectiveness of explicit ‘focus on forms’ instruction, Peters (2012) explored {{the effect of}} two instructional interventions, directing language learners to pay explicit attention to unfamiliar formulaic sequences in a reading text (‘focus on forms’ instruction method) and prompting language learners to allocate attentional resources to unfamiliar formulaic sequences in a reading text by using bold typeface and underlining the target items (‘focus on form’ instruction method), on language learners’ form recall of single words and formulaic sequences. Twenty-eight freshman students of applied language studies at a Flemish institution of higher education {{took part in the}} study. The target items consisted of 12 single words (six <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> typeface/underlined and six <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> typeface/not underlined) and 12 formulaic sequences (six <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> typeface/underlined and six <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> typeface/not underlined). Language learners’ form recall of the 24 target items was measured via an immediate and delayed posttest, in which they had to supply the German translation of as many items as possible. The findings of the study suggested that although the explicit instructional method had an effect on the number of formulaic sequences that language learners wrote down on their vocabulary sheets, it did not induce the kind of processing that resulted in higher recall scores. The use of typographic salience, on the other hand, facilitated vocabulary learning because target items <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> typeface and underlined were not only written down more frequently in language learners’ notes, they were also recalled more often compared to target items not typographically enhanced. These findings suggested the superiority of ‘focus on form’ instruction method over ‘focus on forms’ instruction method.|$|R
5000|$|But in {{the case}} of some composers, such as Gustav Mahler and Dmitri Shostakovich, twice through the {{alphabet}} might still not be enough. For this reason, some editors prefer rehearsal numbers to rehearsal letters. Mahler's and Shostakovich's scores use rehearsal numbers rather than letters. These are typically in boldface and enclosed in a box, or less commonly, a circle. Confusingly, however, some editions enclose bar numbers in boxes, though usually <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold.</b> <b>In</b> the Schirmer edition of Roy Harris's Symphony No. 3 (in one movement), the rehearsal numbers are enclosed in circles, and they occur every ten measures, actually being the bar number divided by 10. That rehearsal numbers [...] "are easily confused with measure numbers" [...] is a reason sometimes given in favor of rehearsal letters.|$|R
