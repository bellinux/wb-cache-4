500|$|O'Neill Surber {{explored}} {{the lyrics of}} Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot {{put my finger on}} it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's {{been a long time since}} I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye some movement. I ducked {{down a little bit}} in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E
60|$|Now I, Hubert, {{watching}} Quilla out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes, saw {{her turn}} pale and tremble.|$|R
60|$|We tried {{a shorter}} kite-line and a shorter length <b>of</b> <b>my</b> line, and we ran down upon that mess of tuna once more. It was strange--and foolish--how we stuck to that school of biggest fish. This time Dan headed {{right into the}} thick of them. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes I seemed to see tuna {{settling}} down all around. Suddenly my brother yelled.|$|R
60|$|Upon one occasion, even, when woollen rags were scarce, and no burned-brick {{was to be}} {{had from}} the ship's Yeoman, I sacrificed <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> woollen shirt, and used some dentrifice I had, as {{substitutes}} for the rags and burned-brick. The dentrifice operated delightfully, and made the threading <b>of</b> <b>my</b> carronade screw shine and grin again, like a set of false teeth in an eager heiress-hunter's mouth.|$|R
60|$|I peeped round <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fan at Miss Melbury. She {{was looking}} at us. I shook hands with Mr. Sax.|$|E
6000|$|... "Number 481 is no better, doctor," [...] {{said the}} head-warder, in a {{slightly}} reproachful accent, looking in round <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> door.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} my {{opponent}} out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. The man was suffering. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Beyond the {{realization}} that I was in <b>the</b> tightest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life, I seemed to have lost the power of thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Desperate man, {{there is}} no need; you will find it to <b>the</b> north-west <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> upper {{secretary}} drawer. I spromise not to appear." ...|$|R
6000|$|The door opened, and M'Leod reappeared. I {{thanked him}} politely, saying I was charmed with my room, anxious to meet Mrs. M'Leod, much {{refreshed}} with my wash, {{and so on}} and so forth. Beyond a little stickiness at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth, it seemed to me that I was managing my words admirably; the while that I myself cowered at the bottom of unclimbable pits. M'Leod laid his hand on my shoulder, and said [...] "You've got it now already, ain't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you see, madam mother, I am at practice," [...] I answered, {{and out of}} <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I {{caught the}} grim {{approving}} twitch of old Falcone's lips.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} Cynthia came in. Out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I {{observed}} {{a look of}} fuddled displeasure come into Tanky's face at her frank pleasure at seeing me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So, {{when the}} morning came, I {{went down to}} the beach, casting out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye at the house of the mother of Unga. My offer yet stood untouched.|$|E
5000|$|Priestley {{was born}} in Portland, Oregon to Mae Irene and Arthur James Priestley. She {{grew up in a}} wooded area near the Willamette River with horses, dogs, a cat and a huge {{collection}} of comic books. Priestley began experimenting with animation early in her life. In an interview with Harvey Deneroff she explained: “One of the first toys I was given was a zoetrope, which worked on a little turntable and had little zoetrope strips with it. I loved it! I’m sure I became an animator because of that toy. Then I started drawing on <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> textbooks in grade school, and later studied art in high school and college, where I specializing in painting and printmaking.” ...|$|R
60|$|Our way led {{us through}} the town where {{everybody}} seemed to be standing about doing nothing and speaking very little. There was a curious air of expectancy upon their faces. They knew that the crisis was at hand, that their nation's fate hung upon the scales, and they watched my every look and movement as though in them they expected to read an omen. I too watched them out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes, wondering whether I should escape from their savage company alive. If once the blood lust broke out among them, {{it seemed to me}} that I should have about as much chance as a chopped fox among a pack of hungry hounds.|$|R
60|$|Then {{that vision}} {{vanished}} and Ayesha's voice {{began to seem}} very far away and dreamy, also her wondrous beauty became visible to me through her veil, as though I had acquired a new sense that overcame the limitations of mortal sight. Even in this extremity I reflected it was well that the last thing I looked on should be something so glorious. No, not quite the last thing, for out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes I saw that Umslopogaas from a sitting position had sunk on to his back and lay, apparently dead, with his axe still gripped tightly and held above his head, as though his arm had been turned to ice.|$|R
60|$|As I lighted a cigar I saw, out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye, how Hoden gave a quick start. I {{expected}} {{some kind}} of a startling idea to flash into his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told me to}} {{wait until}} I was alone with you," [...] I said, {{dropping}} my voice significantly, and watching him intently out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere.|$|E
6000|$|And just then, peeping round <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{chair to}} see if there were any signs of cake, what should I see but a great beastly brute of a rat. It was {{standing}} right beside the visitor, drinking milk out of a saucer, if you please! ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{he began}} to shave, digging his fingers into my countenance to stretch the skin and {{bundling}} and tumbling my head {{this way and that}} as convenience in shaving demanded. As long as he was on the tough sides <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face I did not suffer; but when {{he began to}} rake, and rip, and tug at my chin, the tears came. He now made a handle <b>of</b> <b>my</b> nose, to assist him shaving <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> upper lip, and it was by this bit of circumstantial evidence that I discovered that a part of his duties in the shop was to clean the kerosene-lamps. I had often wondered in an indolent way whether the barbers did that, or whether it was the boss.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} {{at night}} {{by the same}} railroad {{and in the same}} kind of car. One of the passengers being exceedingly anxious to expound at great length to my companion (not to me, of course) the true principles on which books of travel in America should be written by Englishmen, I feigned to fall asleep. But glancing all the way out at window from <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes, I found abundance of entertainment for the rest of the ride in watching the effects of the wood fire, which had been invisible in the morning but were now brought out in full relief by the darkness: for we were travelling in a whirlwind of bright sparks, which showered about us like a storm of fiery snow.|$|R
500|$|Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote [...] "The Way We Were" [...] while Marty Paich handled its production. In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind / Misty watercolor {{memories of the}} way we were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise". In the beginning of {{what seems to be a}} bridge, she whispers, [...] "If we had the chance to do it all again / Tell me would we? Could we?".|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{opened the}} box, and tilted out the {{contents}} upon <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> desk. My hair rose and my flesh grew cold as I looked. There were twelve magnificent square stones engraved with mystical characters. There {{could be no}} doubt that they were the jewels of the urim and thummim.|$|E
60|$|I watched Phaidor from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye. She paled to {{a ghastly}} hue. Slowly, very slowly she turned, as though drawn by some {{invisible}} yet irresistible force. She was standing {{quite close to}} me, so close that her bare arm touched mine as she finally faced Issus, Goddess of Life Eternal.|$|E
6000|$|I took {{a little}} look at him out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye, and wished that as a child I had paid more heed to my {{arithmetic}} lessons. [...] "Look, Mrs Monnerie," [...] I cried piteously, [...] "poor Cherry's tongue is dangling right out of his head. He looks so hot and tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do, if you please, my dear child," [...] {{answered}} Hepzibah. [...] "But {{put it on}} {{the table}} in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage. <b>My</b> eyes are weak; and I can seldom bear the lamplight on them." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{money had}} now retired to <b>the</b> lower <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{left-hand}} pocket {{and it was}} evident that unless I called upon my father for help I must go back to the West; and much as I loved to talk of the broad fields and pleasant streams of Dakota, I dreaded the approach of the hour when I must leave Boston, which was coming to mean more and more to me every day.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{would be}} an equally fair plea in both cases,' replied Nicholas; 'but {{if you put it}} upon that ground, I have nothing more to say, than, that if I were a writer of books, and you a thirsty dramatist, I would rather pay your tavern score for six months, large as it might be, than have a niche in the Temple of Fame with you for <b>the</b> humblest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pedestal, through six hundred generations.' ...|$|R
60|$|You {{may think}} how proud I was {{to walk down}} the village street with my {{magnificent}} relative, and to note out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye how the folk came to the doors and windows to see us pass. Champion Harrison was standing outside the smithy, and he pulled his cap off when he saw my uncle.|$|E
6000|$|Denis nodded. Mr. Barbecue-Smith put {{his hand}} {{in his pocket and}} pulled out a notebook. [...] "I did a few in the train to-day," [...] he said, turning over the pages. [...] "Just dropped off into a trance in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> carriage. I find the train very conducive to good work. Here they are." [...] He cleared his throat and read: ...|$|E
60|$|I babbled on, till from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I saw {{the flush}} fade from the professor's {{face and his}} back {{gradually}} relax its poker-like attitude. The situation was saved for the moment {{but there was no}} knowing what further excesses Ukridge might indulge in. I managed to draw him aside as we went through the fowl-run, and expostulated.|$|E
40|$|These {{poems are}} kidnapped scraps of {{conversation}} and memory, moments passed between women in bedrooms and kitchens and cemeteries, echoing up from pits of despair and <b>the</b> quietest <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life. Scraps that lodged themselves {{in my mind}} till I {{had nothing to do}} but soak them in beer and blood and honey, wring them out, and stretch them taut across a wooden frame so that I could tap them gently to hear any songs they cared to play...|$|R
6000|$|Now I {{was so far}} at {{rest with}} myself, when Sunday came, knowing that I had conquered my own mistrust, and righted Brother Hawkyard in the jaundiced vision of a rival, that I went, even to that coarse chapel, in a less {{sensitive}} state than usual. How could I foresee that the delicate, perhaps <b>the</b> diseased, <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, where I winced and shrunk when it was touched, or was even approached, would be handled as {{the theme of the}} whole proceedings? ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a cluster}} of sixteen bell buttons on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table; <b>my</b> {{proportions}} at that end of me were just right to enable me to cover the whole of that nest, {{and that is how}} I came to hatch out those sixteen clerks.|$|R
