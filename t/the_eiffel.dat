5|$|During World War II, while {{posted in}} Paris as Peruvian air attaché, Bielovucic {{actively}} {{cooperated with the}} French Resistance.

His biography was written by Lieutenant General José Zlatar Stambuk of the Peruvian Air Force and published in 1990.

5|$|During {{its history}} {{spanning}} seven centuries, the castle {{was owned by}} a succession of seven families.

In March 1891, the Quancard brothers Jean and Eugène bought the property for 110 000 francs, and the Quancard family remains the last owners. The purchase came after a severe phylloxera outbreak, causing the death of over half of French vineyards, devalued the property. The land area was covered mostly with rock until the Quancard brothers used explosives to remove it, and large amounts of clay-limestone soil, known to be beneficial for the wine produce, was brought to replace it.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to <b>the</b> <b>Eiffel</b> Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E

However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E

5|$|Just as <b>the</b> <b>Eiffel</b> Tower {{is often}} used in popular culture to {{immediately}} locate a scene in Paris, France, the Tokyo Tower {{is often used}} in the same way for Tokyo. It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please Save My Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The tower is also frequently used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been the location of the climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic view of life in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E
5|$|Parisian {{examples}} of European architecture date {{back more than}} a millennium; including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1014–1163); the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163–1345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239–1248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627–1641) and Les Invalides (1670–1708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808–1842); the Palais Garnier Opera House (1875); the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (1875–1919), and the exuberant Belle Époque modernism of <b>the</b> <b>Eiffel</b> Tower (1889). Striking {{examples of}} 20th-century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), and the Louvre Pyramid by I.M. Pei (1989). Contemporary architecture includes the Musée du Quai Branly by Jean Nouvel (2006) and the new contemporary art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation by Frank Gehry (2014).|$|E
