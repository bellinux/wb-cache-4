5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years {{and went to}} war for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout {{to the extent that}} he was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Cleopatra notwithstanding, Etty {{remained}} {{a student at}} the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his unpleasant experiences <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> left England.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>times</b> <b>he</b> {{appeared}} in 2014 on RTBF TV, he warned against weakness from the authorities, warning the Belgian Vice-Prime minister, Didier Reynders, {{that he and}} other politicians would have soon “blood of innocent people” on their hands since they allowed jihadists to return freely to Belgium and Europe.|$|R

5|$|In 1948 Pechersky {{was arrested}} by the Soviet {{authorities}} along with his brother during the countrywide Rootless cosmopolitan campaign against the Jews suspected of pro-Western leanings. Only after Stalin's death in 1953 was he released from jail {{due in part to}} mounting international pressure. However, the harassment did not stop there. Pechersky was prevented by the Soviet government from testifying in multiple international trials related to Sobibor, including the Eichmann Trial in Israel. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was refused the permission to exit the country and testify was in 1987, for a trial in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|The Kids Are Alright {{was also}} {{completed}} in 1979. It was a retrospective of the band's career, directed by Jeff Stein. The film included {{footage of the}} band at Monterey, Woodstock and Pontiac, and clips from the Smothers Brothers' show and Russell Harty Plus. Moon had died one week after seeing the rough cut with Daltrey. The film contains the Shepperton concert, and an audio track of him playing over silent footage of himself was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> ever played the drums.|$|E

5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, it was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that it was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> would yield under pressure.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 2007 Fowler {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} {{to play for}} Cardiff City. He missed the season's opening fixtures {{due to a lack}} of fitness, making his debut in a League Cup tie on 28 August. He scored his first two Cardiff goals on 22 September against Preston North End, scoring with two headers. Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round League Cup tie against West Brom, which Cardiff won 4–2. This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler's former club Liverpool, at Anfield, to which even the Liverpool faithful crowd urged Fowler to score seeing that it may be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> would play in Anfield but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E

5|$|Recalling his {{homesickness}} {{and loneliness}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had ventured abroad, {{for his next}} foreign trip Etty travelled {{in the company of}} Richard Evans, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence. Despite warnings that Italy would be uncomfortably hot, the two men set out on 23June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome. Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat, they arrived in Paris on 26June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting Versailles and the city's public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens's Marie de' Medici cycle, elements of which he would later reuse in many of his own works.|$|E
5|$|While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming). He had been shot at in The Public Enemy, but during filming for Taxi!, he was almost hit.|$|E
5|$|In January 1833, {{strong winds}} forced {{the old and}} poorly built Jaguaripe aground off Santa Marta beach in the {{southern}} province of Santa Catarina, where it sank. Joaquim Inácio was again the last to abandon ship. The entire crew was rescued, though he himself barely survived. Joaquim Inácio {{and his younger brother}} Bento José (who was also a navy officer) stayed afloat by holding onto a leather basket until reaching the shore. Afterward, Joaquim Inácio was court martialed and absolved of any wrongdoing. On 5 April 1833, he was given command of the barque-brig Vinte e nove de agosto (the same ship he had saved in 1828) and sailed to the province of Maranhão. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had been in the province was in 1825. He remained stationed in the provincial capital (São Luís) as chief of the port until his return to Rio de Janeiro on 30 December 1836. He was transferred to the steam barque Urânia in 1837 and later, on 19 July of the same year, to the brig Constança (a different vessel than the schooner he lost in 1827).|$|E
50|$|Whatever the cause, Barrymore's {{performance}} in Captains Courageous in 1937 {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>times</b> <b>he</b> would be seen standing and walking unassisted. Afterward, Barrymore {{was able to get}} about {{for a short period of}} time on crutches even though he was in great pain. During the filming of 1938's You Can't Take It With You, the pain of standing with crutches was so severe that Barrymore required hourly shots of painkillers. By 1938, Barrymore used a wheelchair exclusively and never walked again. He could, however, stand for short periods of time such as at his brother's funeral.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Fatboy Slim {{played at}} the Glastonbury Festival again and headlined the O2 Wireless Festival and Rockness Festival. According to an NME interview, {{this may have been}} one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>times</b> <b>he</b> {{performed}} as Fatboy Slim, as he may now be focussing on his new album, The Brighton Port Authority (BPA). Also in 2008, Fatboy Slim closed out the famed [...] "Sahara" [...] tent on Friday of the Coachella Valley Music Festival.

5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on stage for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought {{it the best}} thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 2016, Buffon {{kept his}} eighth {{consecutive}} clean sheet in Serie A in a 2–0 win over Inter. In the process, {{he set a}} new personal best in the top flight, and the outright sixth-best unbeaten streak {{in the history of}} the Italian league, after going 746 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, overtaking Morgan De Sanctis and Marchegiani. In the following league match against Atalanta on 6 March, he extended his unbeaten record by keeping another clean sheet in a 2–0 away win, also equalling Dino Zoff's and Sebastiano Rossi's league record of nine consecutive clean sheets in Serie A. His unbeaten streak of 836 minutes without conceding a goal was the third best unbeaten streak in Serie A history, behind only Zoff and Rossi, and was also the longest period a goalkeeper has gone without conceding a goal since three points for a win were introduced in Serie A during the 1994–95 season. He overtook Zoff in a 1–0 home victory over Sassuolo on 11 March, achieving a league record 10 consecutive clean sheets, and extended his unbeaten streak to 926 minutes without conceding a goal, only three minutes behind the all-time record holder, Rossi; <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had conceded a goal was when he was beaten by Antonio Cassano, in the 64th minute of a 2–1 away win over Sampdoria, on 10 January 2016. Buffon surpassed Rossi's record of 929 minutes by 45 minutes in a 4–1 away win over inter-city rivals Torino on 20 March, also surpassing Gianpiero Combi's Italian league record unbeaten streak of 934 minutes in the process; he set the new all-time record at 974 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal. Andrea Belotti finally ended his goalless streak by beating him from the penalty spot in the 48th minute of the same match.|$|E
