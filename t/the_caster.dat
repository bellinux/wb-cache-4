25|$|This gallery holds {{machinery}} {{from the}} last of the hot metal typesetting printshops as used in the newspaper industry. The monotype keyboard produces punched 31-level tape for casting on the monotype caster. The keyboard comprises seven QWERTY arrangements (Roman upper and lower case, bold upper and lower case, italic upper and lower case and SMALL CAPITALS). It is operated by compressed air and produces a wide paper tape that contains perforations that when transferred to <b>the</b> <b>caster</b> give full instructions for each character to be cast. The monotype system was widely used in the commercial printing sector. There is a forme (text lines produced on a Linotype typesetting machine) made up into {{the front page of the}} last edition of the Yorkshire Sports, 2 May 1981. The assembled forme is ready to be moulded and cast into a curved printing plate.|$|E

25|$|The Viet Cong Russian {{roulette}} {{scenes were}} shot in real circumstances, with real rats and mosquitoes, {{as the three}} principals (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) were tied up in bamboo cages erected along the River Kwai. The woman who was given the task of casting the extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game. The first actor hired {{turned out to be}} incapable of slapping De Niro in the face. <b>The</b> <b>caster</b> then found a local Thai man with a particular dislike of Americans, and cast him accordingly. De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped for real by one of the guards without any warning. The reaction on Walken's face was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong Russian roulette scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film.|$|E
25|$|In both timelines, Stocke {{successfully}} overthrows Protea and defeats Hugo. Heiss then attacks, {{saying that}} the sacrifices for the ritual are Granorg royalty who are killed, resurrected using part of another person's soul, then killed again to reunite the soul and stabilize Vainqueur's mana, slowing the Sand Plague. Stocke is revealed to be the intended sacrifice, Eruca's brother resurrected and given a part of Eruca's soul. Heiss, believing the ritual and the sacrifice's suffering to be pointless, intends to let the Sand Plague consume Vainqueur; he abducted Stocke, gave him his present identity, and has been using the Black Chronicle to try and show Stocke the futility of the sacrifice's mission. From Heiss and Teo and Lippti, Stocke learns that the Sand Plague {{was caused by a}} runaway spell intended to stabilize the world's mana and ensure the prosperity of the ancient empire. The empire's surviving royalty created the Black and White Chronicle to facilitate the ritual, allowing the Sacrifice to see hope in the future while <b>the</b> <b>Caster</b> meditated on the past; Teo and Lippti are the remnants of the sorcerer who created the Chronicles. Heiss was the intended Sacrifice, but escaped with the Black Chronicle, which ingrained his fatalistic views.|$|E

Parson's twoll lackey Bogroll tackles Ansom from the parapet and both fall to their deaths. Parson then collapses his own city, killing most coalition forces within the walls, but even this leaves too many enemy units alive. Parson retreats with <b>the</b> <b>casters</b> into <b>the</b> isolated portal room to plan the desperate final attack {{that will be the}} story's climax. Gobwin Knob is built atop an extinct volcano, so Parson orders <b>the</b> <b>casters</b> to make it erupt. <b>The</b> <b>casters</b> use magic to link the minds of Wanda the Croakamancer and Sizemore the Dirtmancer, so that with their combined skill they can uncroak the volcano.|$|R

To power the spell, she and her assistant wizard Koren decide to invade other nations to claim their Mana Stones, though the spell to use the Stone is fatal to <b>the</b> <b>caster.</b> When the Queen tries to force Angela to use it, she flees from Altena. Her paired character is , an orphaned mercenary swordsman of the Grasslands Kingdom of Valsena. His father Loki was lost in battle with the Dragon Emperor. One night, Duran is on guard duty at the castle of Valsena when Koren attacks the castle.

2500|$|A lift jack is {{fundamentally}} a lever that {{attaches to the}} scenery wagon platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to {{the underside of the}} lever near the hinge. When no downward force is applied to the lever handle, the wagon rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks the wagon in place due to friction between the wagon platform and the stage. When the lever handle is forced downward, however, <b>the</b> <b>caster</b> serves as a [...] to lift the wagon slightly above the stage, thus enabling the unit to be rolled.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as <b>the</b> <b>caster</b> returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the hand brake is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges used to monitor boost levels, oil pressure and temperature, intake and coolant temperatures, air-fuel ratio (also called λ, or [...] "lambda" [...] ratio), etc. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.|$|E
2500|$|The {{son of the}} guild's co-founder , [...] is the 88-year-old {{third and}} {{incumbent}} master of Fairy Tail.

He has knowledge of numerous forms of magic, with his specialty being the ability to vastly increase his size using the magic [...] His most powerful spell is , one of the Three Great Fairy Magics developed and used by his guild, which produces a brilliant light that only harms those <b>the</b> <b>caster</b> considers to be an enemy. He is a grandfatherly figure in his guild, and looks upon its members as his own children. However, he is beleaguered by the problems his guild causes him with the council. A running gag throughout the series is his inability to choose a successor as guild master and retire. He eventually promotes Gildarts Clive to guild master to formally replace Macao Conbolt, but is reinstated as sixth master after Gildarts's sudden resignation. After Fairy Tail's battle with Tartaros and Acnologia, Makarov disestablishes the guild to allow its members to follow their own dreams, and, after Fairy Tail is reestablished, is succeeded by Erza Scarlet. During the battle against the Alvarez Empire, Makarov rescues the Ishgal wizards by casting Fairy Law on their enemies' army at the cost of his life, but is later revived by Mavis in exchange for her own life. Mashima came up with his name because he wanted it to sound Russian.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study directional stability during reversing of rear-wheel drive, electric powered wheelchairs (EPW) under different initial front <b>caster</b> orientations. Specifically, <b>the</b> weight distribution differences caused by certain initial caster orientations were examined as a possible mechanism for causing directional instability that could lead to accidents. Directional stability was quantified by measuring the drive direction error of the EPW by a motion analysis system. The ground reaction forces were collected to determine the load on <b>the</b> front <b>casters,</b> as well as back-emf data to attain the speed of the motors. The drive direction error was found to be different for various initial caster orientations. Drive direction error was greatest when both casters were oriented 90 degrees to the left or right, and least when both casters were oriented forward. The results show that drive direction error corresponds to the loading difference on <b>the</b> <b>casters.</b> <b>The</b> data indicates that loading differences may cause asymmetric drag on <b>the</b> <b>casters,</b> which in turn causes unbalanced torque load on the motors. This leads to a difference in motor speed and drive direction error...|$|R

2500|$|The type of cast {{used when}} fishing varies {{according}} to the conditions. The most common cast is the forward cast, where the angler whisks the fly into the air, back over the shoulder until the line is nearly straight, then forward, using primarily the forearm. The objective of this motion is to [...] "load" [...] (bend) the rod tip with stored energy, then transmit that energy to the line, resulting in the fly line (and the attached fly) being cast for an appreciable distance. However, just bending the rod and releasing it to jerk the fly line forward (like a bowstring or a catapult) will not propel the fly line and fly very far. More important is {{the movement of the}} rod through an arc acting as a lever, magnifying the hand movement of <b>the</b> <b>caster</b> (of about a foot) to an arc at the rod tip of several feet. Here the rod acts as a lever. In fact, one of the Class 3 types of lever, where The force is applied between the fulcrum and the load (like tweezers). The fulcrum in the fly cast is below the caster's hand gripping the rod; the load is at the rod tip; between the hand exerts the force. The caster's [...] "stroke" [...] backwards and forwards, for the backcast and the forward cast, operates the rod as a (slightly flexible) lever. Casting without landing the fly on the water is known as 'false casting', and may be used to pay out line, to dry a soaked fly, or to reposition a cast. Other casts are the roll cast, the single- or double-haul, the tuck cast, and the side- or curve-cast.|$|E
