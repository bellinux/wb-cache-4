Others sought to climb up the hillock and then escape into the country. The policemen clambered after them. The men were too frightened to fight, but a woman seized a policeman by the waist and flung him head foremost among the soldiers. One of these shouted [...] "Fire!" [...] but the captain cried [...] "No." [...] Then came showers of missiles from the women. They stood their ground and defended the retreat of the scared men.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "scalawag" [...] native {{conservative}} Republicans and the [...] "carpetbagger" [...] migrant radical Republicans {{had managed}} to form a coalition to seize complete {{control of the state}} in 1868.

50|$|Oceanic crust can be subducted, while {{continental}} crust cannot. Eventually, the subduction of the underthrusting oceanic crust {{can bring}} the volcano chain close to a continent, and collide with it. When the overriding plate collides with the continent, instead of being subducted, it <b>is</b> accreted <b>to</b> {{the edge of the}} continent and becomes a part of that continent. Thin strips or fragments of the underthrusting plate may also remain attached {{to the edge of the}} continent causing those fragments of oceanic crust <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wedged</b> and tilted <b>between</b> the converging plates. In this manner, continents can grow over time as new terranes <b>are</b> accreted <b>to</b> their edges, and so continents can be composed of a complex quilt of terranes of varying ages.|$|R
