25|$|The FBI, which {{initially}} sent {{agents to}} help recover debris, investigated possible foul {{play in the}} crash. After a few days, the bureau determined that the crash was accidental, but only after following several criminal leads involving death threats. Wellstone had been receiving death threats since he took office; the FBI <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> phone to locate the callers. Documents about the FBI's involvement in investigating Wellstone's death were not publicly released until October 2010. Government documents also indicated that the FBI had been following Wellstone {{before he became a}} senator, and included records dating as far back as his arrest at a 1970 antiwar protest.|$|E
500|$|The group {{recorded}} [...] "Wings" [...] at TMS' {{studio in}} London, The Music Shed. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea and John Hanes, with assistance from Phil Seaford at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Little Mix knew {{on their first}} listen {{that it had to}} be DNAs lead single. In April 2012, they played it to Cowell who according to the group <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> foot to the song and called it [...] "genius".|$|E
500|$|In 1921, the Commodores hired Wallace Wade as an {{assistant}} and posted an undefeated, 7–0–1 record. [...] "The Texas game, sparked by McGugin's unforgettable oratory, was the big one." [...] "Instead of hammering detailed strategy into them," [...] coach Dan McGugin had taken his team to the nearby grave of former Vanderbilt quarterback Curry in Marlin, Texas. In a noted speech just before the teams took to the field, referring to this grave, McGugin <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> fingers {{on the floor and}} began: Vanderbilt went on to upset the Longhorns 20–0. Later the same season, Vanderbilt faced Georgia in a contest for the Southern crown, tying the game late on an onside-kick-from-scrimmage 7–7.|$|E

50|$|In 1965, Alsop {{complained to}} friends that Johnson was <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> phone, {{a claim that}} infuriated Johnson, who {{believed}} that he protected Alsop from McCarthy's attacks years before. Alsop told White House Press Secretary Bill Moyers that he believed the Administration was <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> phone and spreading gossip about his personal life, all {{in an attempt to}} stop leaks.|$|R

500|$|John Arlott called him, [...] "a cricketer {{of effect}} {{rather than the}} graces". An {{animated}} presence at the batting crease, he constantly adjusted his equipment and clothing, and restlessly <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> bat {{on the ground as}} the bowler ran in. Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons, Chappell employed the drive and square cut to full effect. He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of mid on, but his trademark shot was the hook, famously saying [...] "three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me". A specialist slip fielder, he was the fourth player to take one hundred Test catches.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Profumo's Commons statement, Ward {{appeared}} on Independent Television News, where he endorsed Profumo's version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as [...] "baseless". Ward's own activities {{had become a}} matter of official concern, and on 1 April the Metropolitan Police began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of his friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, and <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> telephone—this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke. Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo, providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester Terrace house. The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to Holloway Prison for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward. Meanwhile, Profumo was awarded costs and £50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.|$|E
500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1830, George's {{imminent}} end was apparent. Now largely confined to his bedchambers, having completely lost sight in one eye and describing himself [...] "as blind as a beetle", {{he was forced to}} approve legislation with a stamp of his signature in the presence of witnesses. His weight was recorded to be [...] Attacks of breathlessness due to dropsy forced him to sleep upright in a chair, and doctors frequently <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> abdomen to drain excess fluid. Despite his obvious decline, George was admired for clinging doggedly to life. His will to live and still-prodigious appetite astonished observers; in April 1830, the Duke of Wellington wrote the King had consumed for breakfast [...] "a Pidgeon and Beef Steak Pye...Three parts of a bottle of Mozelle, a Glass of Dry Champagne, two Glasses of Port [...] a Glass of Brandy", followed by a large dose of laudanum. Writing to Maria Fitzherbert in June, the King's doctor, Sir Henry Halford, noted [...] "His Majesty's constitution is a gigantic one, and his elasticity under the most severe pressure exceeds what I have ever witnessed in thirty-eight years' experience." [...] Though George had been under Halford's care since the time of the Regency, the doctor's social ambitions and perceived lack of competence were strongly criticised, with The Lancet labelling Halford's bulletins on the King's health as [...] "utterly and entirely destitute of information", subsequently characterising Halford's treatment of George, which involved administering both opium and laudanum as sedatives, as appearing to lack sense or direction.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E
2500|$|One night, a [...] "wetwork" [...] (assassination) squad raids Frank's {{house and}} {{attempts}} to kill him, but he easily wipes them out. Knowing they have <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> phone, he believes Sarah will be targeted. In Kansas City, as Sarah refuses to go with him, he forcibly ties her up and gags her with duct tape. Meanwhile, CIA agent William Cooper is assigned by his boss, Cynthia Wilkes, to hunt down and kill Frank.|$|E
2500|$|He had {{predictable}} mannerisms – having got to {{the crease}} with his [...] "rolling, self-reliant" [...] walk, he took guard, twirled his bat, <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> bat in the crease and took several shuffling steps up to it. Before every ball he would tug his cap. His batting was not slow, but completely unhurried; a spectator once described him as having 'stone-walled' from a quarter to one to half past six for 200.|$|E

The FBI reports on Albizu Campos and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ultimately exceeded over one million pages in length.

2500|$|The Journal-Americans {{investigation}} eventually {{focused on}} Eddie Gard, a player for the Long Island University basketball team who {{was believed to}} be acting as a bagman for the gambling interests. In early January 1951, Kase met secretly with New York District Attorney Frank Hogan. Kase shared his findings with Hogan and agreed to withhold the story until Hogan could develop the case further. [...] Using the evidence collected by Kase, Hogan began tailing Gard and <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> phone. [...] The investigation resulted in the arrest and prosecution of three star players from the City College of New York's 1950 national championship team.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Crowe <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> rock-writer {{roots to}} write and direct Almost Famous, about the {{experiences}} of a teenage music journalist who goes {{on the road with}} an emerging band in the early 1970s. The film starred newcomer Patrick Fugit as William Miller, the baby-faced writer who finds himself immersed in the world of sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, and Kate Hudson co-starred as Penny Lane, a prominent groupie, or, as the film refers to her, a [...] "Band-Aid". Digging into his most personal memories, Crowe used a composite of the bands he had known to come up with Stillwater, the emerging act that welcomes the young journalist into its sphere, then becomes wary of his intentions. Seventies rocker Peter Frampton served as a technical consultant on the film.|$|E

2500|$|His first colour film, Guide with Waheeda Rehman {{was based}} on the novel of the same name by R. K. Narayan. Dev Anand himself was the impetus for making the film version of the book. He met and persuaded Narayan to give his assent to the project. Dev Anand <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> friends in Hollywood to launch an Indo-US co-production that was shot in Hindi and English {{simultaneously}} and was released in 1965. Guide, directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom. [...] He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame and salvation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918 Baby Dodds (Warren [...] "Baby" [...] Dodds, circa 1898–1959), {{playing on}} riverboats with Louis Armstrong on the Mississippi, was modifying the {{military}} marching set-up and experimenting with playing the drum rims instead of woodblocks, hitting cymbals with sticks (1919), {{which was not}} yet common, and adding a side cymbal above the bass drum, {{what became known as}} the ride cymbal. Drum maker William Ludwig developed the [...] "sock" [...] or early low-mounted high-hat after observing Dodd's drumming. Ludwig noticed that Dodd <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> left foot all the time. [...] Dodds had Ludwig raise the newly produced low hats 9 inches higher to make it easier to play, thus creating the modern hi-hat cymbal. Dodds was one of the first drummers to also play the broken-triplet beat that became the standard pulse and roll of modern ride cymbal playing. Dodds also popularized the use of Chinese cymbals.|$|E
2500|$|Promoted to {{vice admiral}} in 1956, Felt {{commanded}} the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean {{for six months}} before the new chief of naval operations, Arleigh Burke, <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> former assistant to be his vice chief, a promotion that leapfrogged Felt over a score of senior admirals and carried the rank of full admiral. As vice chief of naval operations, Felt enjoyed [...] "a reputation for eating admirals for breakfast, lunch and dinner." [...] "The majority of naval officers in the Pentagon when told that Admiral Felt wanted to see them would practically start quivering in their boots," [...] recalled Admiral David McDonald, future chief of naval operations. Burke joked that he kept Felt around because during the war Burke had learned the value of a [...] "no" [...] man. When Burke retired in 1961, Newsweek rated Felt as a 20-1 longshot to succeed Burke as chief of naval operations.|$|E

2500|$|Chiang Ching-kuo {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} in 1978, and in July 1987, he <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> old confidante Lee Huan to be the KMT’s new Secretary-General. [...] Chiang told Lee that he had three goals he would like Lee to fulfill: reform the KMT, move the ROC towards democracy, and move the ROC towards reunification. In {{a speech to the}} KMT’s Kaohsiung headquarters in September 1987, Lee declared that the KMT’s goal was no longer to replace the communist party ruling mainland China, but rather to [...] "push for democracy, freedom of the press, and an open economy in the mainland so as to rid China of Communism and to move it toward a democratic modern state." [...] Many in the KMT’s right-wing claimed the speech betrayed the party’s historic commitment to destroy the communists; Chiang countered by instructing Lee to publish the entire speech in the party’s official journal. The role Lee played in the lifting of martial law in Taiwan and subsequent reforms to the National Assembly led to assembly members characterizing Lee as one of the Red Guards.|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 1792, {{just short}} of his 23rd birthday, James Taylor V left his father's {{plantation}} for Kentucky accompanied by three slaves, Moses, Humphrey and Adam, along with an English Army deserter, Robert Christy, and Christy's wife and their three children. They reached Newport June 20 but couldn't find lodging so he stayed at Ft. Washington in Cincinnati. [...] His enslaved men worked through the summer to clear [...] in fields along the Licking, plant two corn crops and build a small cabin on lot no. 6 at {{the southwest corner of}} Second Street and Central Avenue. [...] He became {{the driving force behind the}} settlement's development. [...] He laid out the first road to Lexington in August with Jacob and Edward Fowler. [...] In 1794 James Taylor <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> connections with Kentucky's leaders to lobby at Frankfort for acts incorporating Newport and creating Campbell County, Kentucky.
