The petitions resulted in 93 preliminary countervailing duty and antidumping investigations involving 9 steel product lines from 9 countries. The petitions were delivered in 494 boxes, contained an estimated 3 million pages and concerned imported carbon steel products with an estimated value of more than $1 billion. The petitions were later withdrawn in 1982 after the United States and the European Community reached an agreement limiting steel imports for three years. The agreement was later expanded in product coverage and extended through September 1989, and subsequently extended through March 1992.|$|E

40|$|Through trade {{policies}} such as antidumping remedies, the United States government often protects domestic producers {{at the expense}} of market competition. Yet a judicially created antitrust immunity, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, obstructs the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust investigations of these <b>trade</b> <b>remedies.</b> This Article argues that judicial and administrative interventions are needed to restore antitrust oversight when implementing <b>trade</b> <b>remedies.</b> This Article does not propose a repealing of the current antidumping statue, an act that would be politically infeasible in the current protectionist atmosphere of Congress. Instead, it takes a more modest yet realistic stance: antidumping remedies must be sanitized by bringing certain abusive behavior in antidumping proceedings – such as deliberate misrepresentations of facts and data – under antitrust rules. In order to prevent domestic producers from abusing antidumping remedies, courts should interpret the sham exception broadly enough to effectively foreclose non-price predation. At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission, under its vested antitrust authority, should strengthen its surveillance and enforcement activities to guard against the abuse of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies.</b> In the long-term, these targeted judicial and administrative interventions will lead the public and legislators alike to rethink the antidumping statute itself...|$|R

50|$|The Canadian {{government}} and lumber industry dispute this assertion, {{based on a}} number of factors, including that Canadian timber is provided to such a wide range of industries, and that lack of specificity makes it ineligible to be considered a subsidy under U.S. law.

This requirement precludes imposition of countervailing duties on government programs, such as roads, that are meant to benefit a broad array of interests.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} newly {{available data}} from the World Bank-sponsored Global Antidumping Database tracking the worldwide use of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> such as antidumping, countervailing duties, global safeguards and China-specific safeguards during the current economic crisis.

50|$|The {{heart of}} the dispute is {{the claim that the}} Canadian lumber {{industry}} is unfairly subsidized by federal and provincial governments, as most timber in Canada is owned by the provincial governments. The prices charged to harvest the timber (stumpage fee) are set administratively, rather than through the competitive marketplace, the norm in the United States.

40|$|Document {{presented}} for discussion at the OECD Directorate for Science Technology 2 ̆ 6 Industry, Steel Committee Meeting, 10 - 11 December 2009. The GATT authorizes three <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> {{that can be}} utilized {{by members of the}} WTO to address troublesome imports: antidumping measures and countervailing duties, which are authorized by Article VI, and safeguards which are authorized by Article XIX. Detailed roadmaps for the application of these measures were adopted in the Uruguay Round implementing agreements that each WTO member is required to observe in applying trade measures against imports from other WTO member countries. This Report summarizes the rules governing application of these three <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> and points out the major areas where there are proposals to amend the antidumping and countervailing duty implementing agreements in the Rules Negotiations that are one of the four main pillars of the DOHA Round which has been underway since the Development Agenda was agreed to by WTO members in November 2001. There is also a discussion of special rules that apply when these <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> are applied against imports from nonmarket economies. The discussion focuses on China which is not only the most frequent subject of antidumping and countervailing duty actions by WTO members, but is also a frequent user of the antidumping measure and has recently initiated countervailing duty investigations of imports from the United States. China is in a unique situation as a result of special provision in its WTO Accession Protocol concerning the application of these measures to its exports. The Accession Protocol also authorizes WTO members to adopt safeguards applicable uniquely to Chinese imports, such as those that were recently applied by the United States in a case involving Chinese passenger vehicle and light truck tires...|$|R

5000|$|In March 2006, a NAFTA panel {{ruled in}} Canada's favor, {{finding that the}} subsidy to the Canadian lumber {{industry}} was de minimis, i.e., a subsidy of less than one percent. Under U.S. <b>trade</b> <b>remedy</b> law, countervailing duty tariffs are not imposed for de minimis subsidies. A tentative deal was reached in July 2006, in which Canada got $4 billion of the $5.3 billion it lost because of the penalties with no additional tariffs to be imposed. After initial opposition from several large Canadian lumber concerns, the Harper government, without specifying how many companies endorsed it, was confident {{that there would be}} enough support to culminate the deal. In August 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper brought the new deal to Parliament for discussion and a possible confidence vote. If the House of Commons had voted against the deal, it would have automatically forced a general election and annulled the deal. The Conservatives were in favor of the deal, while the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party were against, leaving the Bloc Québécois as the deciding party.On September 7, Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe endorsed the softwood lumber deal, effectively neutralizing any chance of an election coming out of a non-confidence vote. Five days later, Canadian International Trade Minister David Emerson, along with U.S. counterpart Susan Schwab, officially signed the deal in Ottawa. Despite supporters' claims that it was the best deal possible, Elliott Feldman, an international and economic law specialist from the firm Baker & Hostetler in Washington, D.C. and {{a former director of the}} Canadian-American Business Council, criticized the deal as [...] "... one-sided ..." [...] and a [...] "... bad deal for Canada". On September 19, 2006, the deal passed its first reading in the Canadian House of Commons with a 172-116 majority. On September 27, the Canadian Press reported that Canada did not meet an October 1 deadline imposed by itself to implement the agreement. Withdrawal of some of the 30 issues regarding the deal was the main reason for the delay on complying to the deal.|$|E

40|$|Although {{competition}} {{has been an}} ideological beacon of economic governance ever since {{the birth of the}} Union, it has largely been an internal affair. External competition from foreign producers has failed to be factored into antitrust scrutiny. On the contrary, the government, through its trade policies such as antidumping remedies, has often hampered foreign competition to protect domestic producers at the expense of all the benefits that foreign competition might bring to the economy. Antidumping remedies tend to create a legal cartel: they fix the import prices and generate non-price predation by petitioners. However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 2 ̆ 7 s potential antitrust mission over <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> is severely obstructed by a judicially created antitrust immunity labeled the 2 ̆ 2 Noerr-Pennington doctrine. 2 ̆ 2 As a legal reincarnation of political pluralism under the Warren court, this doctrine expansively immunizes antidumping petitioners from any antitrust investigations over their potentially trade-restraining behaviors. Against this backdrop, I argue in this Article that the failure to allow antitrust oversight when implementing <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> should be rectified by means of judicial and administrative intervention. I do not propose herein a repealing of the current antidumping statute: such a drastic measure would be politically infeasible in the current protectionist atmosphere of Congress.

At the same time, the FTC, under its vested antitrust authority, should reinforce its surveillance and enforcement activities to guard against the abuse of <b>trade</b> <b>remedies</b> by domestic producers.
