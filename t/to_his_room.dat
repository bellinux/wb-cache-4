5|$|Bart's House of Weirdness is an action-adventure-strategy {{platform}} {{game that}} uses single-screen movement. The plot sees Bart grounded <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> {{by his parents}} Homer and Marge after having pulled one too many pranks.

5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> and puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program.

When Lisa places the {{centerpiece}} on the table, she argues with Bart about where it should go {{since there is no}} room left for the turkey.

5|$|The wound severed Sharp's aorta, {{killing him}} almost instantly. Sharp's wife Eliza {{witnessed}} the entire {{scene from the}} top of the stairs in the house, but Beauchamp fled before he could be identified or captured. Returning to the site where he had buried a change of clothes, he stripped off his disguise, tied it up with a rock, and sank them in the Kentucky River. In his regular clothes, he returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E
5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> {{where he}} was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
6000|$|But Jacob moved. He murmured good-night. He {{went out}} into the court. He buttoned his jacket across his chest. He went back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> and being the only man who walked at that moment back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>his</b> {{footsteps}} rang out, his figure loomed large. Back from the Chapel, back from the Hall, back from the Library, came the sound of his footsteps, as if the old stone echoed with magisterial authority: [...] "The young man--the young man--the young man-back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rooms." ...|$|R
60|$|WHEN Stella {{left the}} conservatory, the {{attraction}} of the ball for Romayne was at an end. He went back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>rooms</b> at the hotel.|$|R

5|$|At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots {{to become}} Sultan by marrying Jasmine. When Aladdin greets Jafar and the Sultan at the palace, Jasmine becomes upset at them. Refusing his friends advising {{him to tell}} Jasmine the truth, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a flight on the magic carpet. When she deduces his identity, he convinces her that he dresses as a peasant to escape the {{stresses}} of royal life. After Aladdin sends Jasmine home, he is ambushed by Jafar, but is rescued from drowning by the Genie with his second wish. Jafar tries to hypnotize the Sultan into agreeing to his marriage to Jasmine, but Aladdin appears and prevents Jafar from doing so. After Jafar returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> he orders Iago to retrieve the lamp from Aladdin after discovering his true identity.|$|E
5|$|Bhagyalakshmi, a young woman, has a car {{accident}} while returning from a party and is hospitalised with severe head injuries. When she recovers, she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia and she fails to recognise her own parents. She mentally regresses {{to the state of}} a child. While she is undergoing treatment, she is kidnapped and sold to the madam of a brothel. Srinivas, also known as Cheenu, comes to Chennai to meet his old friend. Together, they visit the brothel to relax. The madam sends Bhagyalakshmi, renamed Vijaya, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room.</b> Cheenu realises that she is mentally still a child and pities her. He learns that she is from a cultured family, and that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution.|$|E
5|$|Captain Waggett, the stuffy English {{commander}} of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a party in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload {{a large number of}} cases before the ship goes down. Campbell had been sent <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> by his mother for a prior transgression, but is persuaded to leave and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also fortifies the teetotal Campbell's courage enough so he can stand up to his mother regarding Catriona.|$|E

5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room.</b> Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E

5|$|Marge and Homer {{attend a}} parent-teacher night at Springfield Elementary School. Although Miss Hoover tells Homer that Lisa is doing well, Mrs. Krabappel tells Marge that Bart is {{continually}} causing trouble. Urging Homer and Marge to enforce stronger discipline on Bart {{with the idea}} that he could grow up to become a Supreme Court Justice if he turns his life around, the two return home to find that Bart stole and broke Grampa's false teeth. Therefore, Bart is sent up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room</b> without dinner as punishment, but Homer sneaks up and brings him some pizza, making Bart promise to behave. However, Bart continues to get in trouble and Homer's attempts to discipline him fail. Eventually he promises Marge to make the next punishment stick.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and {{determined}} that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz's wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., visited on most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford {{during the first week}} of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30pm, Morenz tried to get out of bed to use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.|$|E
5|$|Walker began {{monitoring}} Riley and denying him {{access to}} liquor, but Riley {{found ways to}} evade Walker. At {{a stop at the}} Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>room.</b> He became too drunk to perform, and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.|$|E
