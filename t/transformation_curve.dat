50|$|To {{understand}} this better, {{we refer to}} the graph in this section, which shows Food on the vertical axis and Leisure on the horizontal axis. OS represents the subsistence level of food consumption, or the minimum level of food consumed by agricultural labor that is necessary for their survival. I0 and I1 between the two commodities of food and leisure (of the agriculturists). The origin falls on G, such that OG represents maximum labor and labor input would be measured from the right to the left.The <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> SAG falls from A, which indicates that more leisure {{is being used to}} same units of land. At A, the marginal transformation between food and leisure and MPL = 0 and the indifference curve I0 is also tangent to the <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> at this point. This is the point of leisure satiation.|$|E
50|$|Consider a {{case where}} a laborer shifts from the {{agricultural}} to the industrial sector. In that case, the land left behind would be divided between the remaining laborers and as a result, the <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> would shift from SAG to RTG. Like at point A, MPL at point T would be 0 and APL {{would continue to be}} the same as that at A (assuming constant returns to scale). If we consider MPL = 0 as the point where agriculturalists live on the subsistence level, then the curve RTG must be flat at point T {{in order to maintain the}} same level of output. However, that would imply leisure satiation or leisure as an inferior good, which are two extreme cases. It can be surmised then that under normal cases, the output would decline with shift of labor to industrial sector, although the per capita output would remain the same. This is because, a fall in the per capita output would mean fall in consumption in a way that it would be lesser than the subsistence level, and the level of labor input per head would either rise or fall.|$|E

The main result is that redistributive effects between landowners and farmers depend on the total number of entitlements, so they have to be considered as a lever to increase the transfer efficiency of the scheme.

The measured softening temperature is interpreted to extrapolate the slag viscosity-temperature curves far into the low temperature – high viscosity region. Continuous-cooling <b>transformation</b> <b>curves</b> were extracted from XRD analysis of DSC test samples and thermocouple dip tests. Time-temperature <b>transformation</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained from similar analysis of melted mold powder samples that were atomized into droplets, quenched to form glass, and then partially devitrified by reheating to different temperatures for different times and quenched. Polarized light microscopy, SEM, and EDX analysis revealed distinct crystalline and glassy layers, but no severe macro-segregation in a tail-out slag film taken from an operating caster. The results from these new measurements have important implications for the prediction of interfacial gap phenomena, including mold heat transfer, friction, slag layer fracture, and steel surface quality...|$|R

30|$|The “rose” is {{an image}} having good {{contrast}} and soothing brightness (in scale of 255, D= 265.51, μ= 218.79). We choose this image to experiment on the outcomes of different methods on a good quality image. In this image, the minimum and maximum intensities are 11 and 255, respectively. More than 60 % intensities are exactly 255 (mostly coming from the white background). HE and EHS create annoying artifacts which are strongly visible on the leaves and the petals. HE transforms most of the bright pixels to darker regions (e.g., 254 into 101, 200 into 53). As a result, the petals of the rose become dark. Similarly, EHS and RSWHE transform pixels of intensity 255 to lower ones and create dark shades in the background. CVC, LDR, and HMF make the image darker whereas RSWHE and AGCWD increase the brightness. In all of these cases, the output image loses its original contrast. However, AGC does not affect most of the intensities because of the linear nature of its <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> (the <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> is shown in Fig. 9 using Eqs. (2), (4), and (9)). Hence, visual information of the image is preserved and slightly enhanced.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} further reveal the {{microstructural}} characterization and formation mechanism of abnormal segregation band of hot rolled ferrite/pearlite steel, the microstructure {{of this type}} steel was intensively studied with Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM), etc. The results show that severe C–Mn segregation exists in the abnormal segregation band region {{at the center of}} hot rolled ferrite/pearlite steel, which results from the Mn segregation during solidification process of the continuous casting slab. The C–Mn segregation causes relative displacement of pearlite <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> and bainite <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> of C curve in the corresponding region, leading to bay-like shaped C curve. The bay-like shaped C curve creates conditions for the transformation from supercooling austenite to bainite at relatively lower cooling rate in this region. The Fe–Mn–C Atomic Segregation Zone (FASZ) caused by C–Mn segregation can powerfully retard the atomic motion, and increase the lattice reconstruction resistance of austenite transformation. These two factors provide thermodynamic and kinetic conditions for the bainite transformation, and result in the emergence of granular bainitic abnormal segregation band at the center of steel plate, which leads to lower plasticity and toughness of this region, and induces the layered fracture...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{approach}} to investigate the <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> of gearing safety. Two types of tooth failures are known to happen to spur gears. There are tooth bending failure (breakage) and tooth surface pitting failure. The focus of this study however {{will be on the}} JGMA and AGMA standards of gearing. Different methods were used to gather relevant data from both standards. JGMA data were gathered from a source in the internet while AGMA data were calculated with the aid of Autodesk Inventor spur gear component generator 2013. The most important data is the allowable torque applied on the gear tooth which can be distinguished into causing either one of the tooth failures mentioned above. Several materials selected from the JGMA and AGMA standards with high value of allowable contact stress compared to its allowable bending stress have a <b>transformation</b> <b>curve</b> from surface durability to bending strength when its torque values are plotted against number of teeth.

The curved element considered here is the 28 -node (sextic) triangular element.
