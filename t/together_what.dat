King then sent Captain Gordon Blainey's A Platoon around the right flank, towards the high ground on Mission Hill which overlooked the battlefield. It was secured by 07:30. In the meantime, some of the 2/6th Independent Company's signallers and headquarters personnel gathered <b>together</b> <b>what</b> ammunition they could, and delivered it to C Platoon at around 07:00. C Platoon then fixed bayonets and continued its advance.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe <b>together.</b> <b>What</b> I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'.

Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process.

Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on Beechey Island, where three crew members died and were buried. Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note dated 25 April 1848, and {{left on the}} island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the crew had wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining crew had planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 toward the Back River on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along the way, most {{on the island and}} another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds of miles from the nearest outpost of Western civilization.|$|E

25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put <b>together</b> <b>what</b> was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
25|$|There {{still was}} no formal {{organisation}} of international tours, with any promoter free {{to try to}} put together a touring side. However, for ten years, only one team had toured for any one Australian summer. In 1887/8 this changed. Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury put <b>together</b> <b>what</b> was to turn out to be not only their last professional tour, but the last English tour led by a professional for sixty-seven years. Their team was invited to Australia by the Melbourne Cricket Club. Shaw himself did not tour, but stayed at home to put together a football side that played rugby union and Victorian rules (now known as Australian rules) football in Australia after the cricket tour. The tour was a financial disaster, with the Melbourne Cricket Club, Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury well out-of-pocket. Lillywhite defaulted on his debt. All the English team was mostly professional, to boost the status of the team, an amateur, Aubrey Smith, was invited to captain it.|$|E

Eventually Raimi came across Irvin Shapiro, {{the man who was}} responsible for the distribution of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead and other famous horror films. Upon first viewing the film, he joked that while it [...] "wasn't Gone with the Wind", it had commercial potential, and he expressed an interest in distributing it. It was his idea not to use the then-title Book of the Dead, because it made the film sound boring. Raimi brainstormed several ideas, eventually going with The Evil Dead, deemed the [...] "least worst" [...] title. Shapiro also advised distributing the film worldwide to garner a larger income, though it required a further financial investment by Raimi, who managed to scrape <b>together</b> <b>what</b> little money he had.|$|E

From street performers to homeless youth {{to some of the most}} famous celebrities in the world, Thirty Seconds to Mars compiled a panel that concisely and visually demonstrate the extreme highs and lows of Los Angeles in eleven minutes." [...] Luke O'Neil from MTV noted that [...] "interspersed with the real celebrities are a series of celebrity impersonators, which only heightens the underlying conceit about the fuzzy intersection of dreams and reality. That's the idea of Los Angeles". Emily Wright from The Boston Globe noticed the [...] "raw, personal side to some of today's most popular celebrities" [...] featured. Scott Sterling of CBS News called it a [...] "compelling examination on life in Los Angeles".|$|E

Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers.

500|$|After Williams {{completed}} several {{drafts of}} the screenplay, the company hired Kevin Hood {{to aid in}} further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained [...] "a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane." [...] Hood was attracted to the film because he believed [...] "the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice." [...] Calling Austen a [...] "genius" [...] and [...] "one of the top two or three prose writers of all time", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy [...] "was absolutely essential in shaping her work." [...] Hood acknowledged however that Becoming Jane is [...] "based on the facts as they are known {{and the majority of}} characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving <b>together</b> <b>what</b> we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece <b>together</b> <b>what</b> had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|Ocean {{accepted}} Williams' offer, {{and the two}} {{went into}} the studio to record songs together. After their sessions <b>together,</b> <b>what</b> they had produced was worked sonically {{into the rest of}} the album, one of the tracks becoming [...] "Sweet Life". The song draws inspiration from the early life of Ocean, who grew up in New Orleans and who now lives in Beverly Hills. Ocean's hometown of New Orleans was hit by Hurricane Katrina, forcing Ocean to relocate to Beverly Hills. Ocean's early upbringing and experiences with Beverly Hills shaped the themes of the song, such as his dismay with people living intentionally insulated lives. Though Williams co-wrote the song with Ocean, it has been described as deeply personal to Ocean in content. A download for the song was posted onto Ocean's personal Tumblr account on July 6, 2012 in promotion of the album. It was simultaneously posted onto his SoundCloud account. The track was released a few days following Ocean's coming out as a bisexual, which sparked additional interest in the song. Ocean performed the track during his 14 show Channel Orange tour through North America.|$|E
