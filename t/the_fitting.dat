5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if {{the owner of the}} vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E

5|$|Experience during {{operations}} later led to {{the development}} of specialised armoured equipment by Australian industry for use in jungle operations in the South West Pacific Area. A range of modifications were subsequently developed for the Matilda, including <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of wire mesh screens or metal tracking over the engine and air louvres to protect it against magnetic mines, an armoured shield on top of the hull to protect the turret ring, a microphone and headset attached to the rear to act as a telephone for infantry co-operation, waterproofing equipment for deep wading, a tank dozer, a flamethrowing tank called the Matlida Frog, and one capable of firing a salvo of naval mortar bombs, known as the Matilda Hedgehog. The Frog was capable of projecting a flame , while the Hedgehog was designed to fire multiple projectiles at concrete blockhouses. Used in combat in the final year of the war in support of Australian infantry at Balipapan, the Frog proved a successful adaptation. Trials were also undertaken to fit air conditioning to the Matildas to improve the endurance of crews in tropical conditions. Limited modifications were also undertaken on the M3 Grant medium tanks, including <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of a small number of dozer variants and trials to waterproof the vehicles for wading.|$|E

Indiana was commissioned into the fleet on 30 April 1942. After shakedown operations, she was sent directly to the Solomon Islands; Indiana arrived off Guadalcanal on 9 November 1942 and replaced her sister South Dakota, which {{was in need of}} repairs. Indianas operations off Guadalcanal consisted primarily of shore bombardment in support of the Marines fighting on the island.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell {{was aware}} of the {{reputation}} for poor steaming enjoyed by the class and attempted to address it by <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of twin Kylchap blastpipes to No. 860 in 1934. However, the problem was ultimately solved by Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern in 1938. He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was highly respected.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne was {{constructed}} by Vickers-Armstrongs at their Naval Construction Yard in Barrow-in-Furness, England. The ship was laid down as HMS Majestic on 15 April 1943, and was launched on 28 February 1945 by Lady Anderson, {{the wife of}} Sir John Anderson, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. Following the end of World War II, the Admiralty ordered the suspension of many British shipbuilding projects, including <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> out of Majestic and her five sister ships.

5|$|Nine B.2 {{aircraft}} {{were converted}} for strategic reconnaissance purposes to replace Valiants {{which had been}} withdrawn due to wing fatigue, with delivery beginning in July 1965. These aircraft received a variety of cameras, a bomb bay-mounted radar mapping system and wing top sniffers to detect particles released from nuclear testing. Designated Victor SR.2, a single aircraft could photograph {{the whole of the}} United Kingdom in a single two-hour sortie. Different camera configurations could be installed in the bomb bay, including up to four F49 survey cameras and up to eight F96 cameras could be fitted to take vertical or oblique daylight photography; nighttime photography required <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of F89 cameras.|$|E

Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} reconstructed from late 1933 to mid-1936. In August 1937, the sisters transported 3,749 {{men of the}} 11th Infantry Division to Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Their floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before they {{returned}} to Sasebo the following day. Nagato became a training ship on 1 December 1937 until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938. The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940. The sisters were refitted in 1941 in preparation for war, which included <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of external degaussing coils and additional armor for their barbettes.|$|E
5|$|When {{the weather}} improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed {{before the first}} work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|E

A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. <b>The</b> <b>fitting</b> of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|Authorized to be {{built by}} Ansaldo of Genoa, the new battleship's keel was laid down on 14 May 1938 and {{launched}} on 15 November 1939. At her launching, she was christened Impero, after Italy's empire in Africa. With Genoa being in bombing range of France, and war now a definite possibility, Impero was moved to Brindisi on 8 June 1940 due to fears of French attack. Trieste was considered a better location, but Roma was fitting out there and the shipyard could not handle two battleships at one time. While at Brindisi, some of her machinery was installed, along with parts of her smaller caliber weaponry. Despite the intent to move Impero to a safer location, Brindisi was still hit by Allied bombers, though Impero was not damaged. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to shift production priorities to desperately needed escorts for merchant convoys. As a result, construction of Impero was delayed to expedite those ships. The only work done was <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of the engines and some gun mountings.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{long period}} of uneventful {{development}} flying trials and <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> of a modified Proteus 765 series engine that greatly reduced breakdowns, a full Certificate of Airworthiness was awarded at the end of 1955. The first two Model 102s were delivered to BOAC on 30 December 1955 for crew training. The Model 102 began scheduled service on 1 February 1957 with a BOAC flight from London to Johannesburg, flights to Sydney following in March and to Tokyo in July. By August 1957, the first 15 Model 102 aircraft had been delivered to BOAC. The last 10 aircraft of the order were built as Series 300 aircraft for transatlantic flights. In April 1959, a Model 102 Britannia was leased by BOAC to Ghana Airways for flights between Accra and London, and several more Britannias were purchased by the airline in the early 1960s. The Model 102 was eventually made available to other BOAC associates, including Cathay Pacific, Central Africa, East African, Nigeria and Malayan airlines.|$|E
