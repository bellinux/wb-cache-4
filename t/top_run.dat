25|$|After {{being dropped}} from all formats {{for three and}} a half years, his {{impressive}} displays domestically (most notably being the <b>top</b> <b>run</b> scorer in the President's One Day Trophy in the season 2013/14) earned him a deserved recall to the national side for the Asia Cup in 2014.

25|$|This was {{the first}} World Twenty20, where 12 teams participated, divided into four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. Besides the 10 full members, Kenya and Scotland were the other two teams {{participating}} in this tournament that was played on three different grounds, Wanderers, Kingsmead and Newlands. The tournament was a huge success. It had everything required for top quality entertainment, including the world's best players and packed out stadiums. The tournament got underway with a stunning display of power hitting from Chris Gayle against South Africa. He clouted 117 off 57 balls, including 10 sixes. Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini- nobody was spared. If this wasn't enough, Yuvraj Singh achieved cricketing nirvana by hitting England's Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over, during a barnstorming and unlikely 12-ball fifty. It wasn't entirely all batsmen-led action however, as Brett Lee claimed the first hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals, for Australia against Bangladesh. The breathless tournament culminated in a final that thrilled from start to finish, as India and Pakistan battled it out for the trophy. The match went down to a final-over thriller, with Pakistan needing six from the last four balls. But India eventually triumphed as Misbah-ul-Haq's attempted scoop off Joginder Singh landed {{in the hands of}} Sreesanth at short fine-leg. Mathew Hayden was the <b>top</b> <b>run</b> getter with 265 runs and Umar Gul took the most wickets, 13. Craig McMillan hit 13 sixes in the tournament, highest by any player.|$|E
