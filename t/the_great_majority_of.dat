5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gregarious German cockroach, have an {{elaborate}} social structure involving common shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition. Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> {{the art in}} {{and around}} the Houses of Parliament is of British origin, due to a policy of {{acquiring}} British art for the building.

5|$|The living {{members of}} the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two {{subclass}}es. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (bristle millipedes). All other millipedes belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill millipedes, and Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes), containing <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the species.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> black men. White male-only primary elections also served {{to reduce the}} influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks {{were excluded from the}} political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E

For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> cells, smooth ER {{regions are}} scarce {{and are often}} partly smooth and partly rough. They are {{sometimes}} called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is abundant and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the strongest}} bases of anti-Communist {{sentiment}} in the United States was the Catholic community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common {{during the early}} epoch, {{and the majority of}} galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E

5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Worship at St James' is {{in a style}} {{commonly}} found in the High Church and moderate Anglo-Catholic traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a robed choir singing psalms, anthems and responses in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the ordination of women.|$|E
5|$|A {{final element}} in {{creating}} and sustaining the Athens musical culture was the University of Georgia Lamar Dodd School of Art. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Athens' musicians and their fan base {{were associated with}} the University's liberal arts curriculum, and the School of Art, rather than the music department, was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began forming in the 1970s. Michael Stipe of R.E.M. was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for Pylon. The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA: Inside/Out was Jim Herbert, an art school professor. Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands, including 14 for R.E.M.|$|E

5|$|After the {{unification}} of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD, Gyeongju {{became the center of}} Korean political and cultural life. The city was home to the Silla court and <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom's elite. Its prosperity became legendary, and was reported as far away as Persia according to the 9th century book The Book of Roads and Kingdoms. Records of Samguk Yusa give the city's population in its peak period as 178,936 households, suggesting that the total population was almost one million. Many of Gyeongju's most famous sites date from this Unified Silla period, which ended in the late 9th century by Goryeo (918â1392).|$|E
5|$|As the Arabs customarily did not {{campaign}} during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Harith's urging, on {{the other}} hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack south of the Oxus, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Harith and his followers, but by <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan. Asad quickly mobilized his forces and managed to catch the khagan himself with {{a small part of}} his army and defeat them at Kharistan. Although both the khagan and Harith escaped capture, the Battle of Kharistan struck a blow to the khagans prestige, and Suluk's murder by his rivals a short while afterwards saved the Muslims from worse.|$|E
5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E
