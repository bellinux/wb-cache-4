By applying the radiation-to-scattering transform, the scattering problem can be considered as the specific radiation problems where the radiated source equivalent to the electromagnetic plane wave is located at infinity. The volumetric currents which generate right circular polarization (RCP) and left circular polarization (LCP) plane waves, respectively, are found. An integral equation consisting the volumetric current distributions and the dyadic Green’s functions is formulated to obtain both the equivalent incident wave fields and the scattered fields. Two-layered lossless and lossy dielectric spheres and a conducting sphere with a dielectric coated layer buried in an infinitely extended host chiral medium are considered and the expressions for the scattered fields in far-zone are found in explicit analytic form. <b>The</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We have {{identified}} a class of high–velocity clouds which are compact and apparently isolated. The clouds are compact in that they have angular sizes less than 2 degrees FWHM.

Candidates for inclusion in this class were extracted from the Leiden/Dwingeloo H i survey of Hartmann & Burton (1997) and from the Wakker & van Woerden (1991) catalogue of high–velocity clouds identified in the surveys of Hulsbosch & Wakker (1988) and of Bajaja et al.

Meanwhile, many wild poplar populations (Populus spp.) are highly degraded {{due in part to}} logging, dams, grazing, and agriculture. This raises the possibility that gene flow from plantation trees could have negative impacts on native tree populations. I analyzed gene flow from poplar plantations using a combination of large-scale field studies, genetic analyses, and simulation modeling. I describe development of a spatially explicit simulation model that depicts the processes of pollination, dispersal, establishment, competition, disturbance, and management activities on a landscape in western Oregon where hybrid poplar plantations are a prominent feature. Using sensitivity analyses, I demonstrate that competitiveness and fertility of transgenic trees were important factors determining the extent of modeled gene flow, and that these factors interacted such that the effects of enhanced competitiveness appeared to be obviated by cultivation of low-fertility transgenic trees.

Fractal {{dimension}} {{is one of}} the parameters for characterizing the fracture surface of materials quantitatively, and is also the basis for analyzing the fracture mechanism of materials, so it is very important in mechanic of materials. In order to improve the efficiency of calculation on fractal dimension of fracture surface of materials by triangular prism surface area method (TPSAM), a program for TPSAM based on Matlab 7. 1 was compiled and verified by using of two different samples. The results indicated that the program was easy to be read and operate, and the calculated fractal dimension of the samples was in a range from 2 to 3. Therefore, the program was accurate and could be used widely. The mechanical properties of material are determined by its internal micro structure and experimental conditions, and the micro structure and the experimental conditions also affect the morphology of fracture surface of material.

40|$|Executive {{function}} {{is a product}} of the coordinated operation of multiple neural systems and an essential prerequisite for a variety of cognitive functions. The prefrontal cortex is known to be a key structure for the performance of executive functions. To accomplish the coordinated operations of multiple neural systems, the prefrontal cortex must monitor the activities in other cortical and subcortical structures and control and supervise their operations by sending command signals, which is called top-down signaling. Although neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have provided evidence that the prefrontal cortex sends top-down signals to the posterior cortices to control information processing, the neural correlate of these top-down signals is not yet known. Through use of the paired association task, it has been demonstrated that top-down signals are used to retrieve specific information stored in long-term memory. Therefore, we used a paired association task to examine the neural correlates of top-down signals in the prefrontal cortex.

Accordingly for the purposes of certifying the health of financial statements produced by such systems, the government auditors were satisfied with the development of data extracting and analytical tools. These tools essentially bypassed the requirements of auditing through the computer because, instead of testing the program logic, data security, control environment, and system’s cost effectiveness, most of the CAATs were designed primarily for extracting data from the system for auditors ’ analysis.

Background: In Korea, the drivers were aged 40 ~ 50 s are most plentiful. In addition, the intersection traffic accidents are increasing every year. However, the researches for middle-aged drivers and intersection environments have been little. Method: In this study, three kinds of left-turning intersection types(T 1, T 2, T 3) was used as the within-subject independent variables, three age groups(young, middle-aged, elderly) was used as the between-subject independent variables. Also, passing time, approaching velocity, speed and steering variations and heart-rate were used as dependent variables. Results: Overall, middle-aged drivers ' driving behaviors were similar to those of the younger drivers. At the T 2 intersection type, however, the approaching velocity of middle-aged drivers was similar to younger drivers, whereas the passing time of middle-aged drivers was similar to elderly drivers. Conclusion: These results could be interpreted that a transition driving behavior of middle-aged drivers in terms of age would be appeared on the T 2 intersection type.

The {{reflection and}} refraction of harmonic SH waves at {{the interface between}} a homogeneous solid and a one-dimensional phononic crystal is studied. The effects of wave frequencies on the refraction coefficients are investigated. The results show that for lower frequencies, most part of the energy is reflected into the homogeneous solid and that the frequency has little effects on the energy distribution at the interface. While for higher frequencies, SH waves cannot propagate in some directions because {{of the existence of}} the directional band gaps, which results in the discontinuity in the refraction coefficient curve. For waves passing through the interface, the higher the frequency is, the smaller the refraction coefficient is. Phononic crystals are periodic composites with frequency ranges in which propagation of elastic waves is forbidden. These frequency ranges, which are named as frequency band gaps [1], suggest wide potential applications of the phononic crystals in many fields, such as noise suppressors, acoustic filters, vibration isolation, noise reduction and transducer technology.
