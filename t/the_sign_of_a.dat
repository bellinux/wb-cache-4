5|$|Ramayana narrates: Tara {{says that}} Sugriva is mindful that through Rama, Sugriva has gained the kingship, Ruma and herself. She defends Sugriva saying that even great sage Vishwamitra was tempted by pleasure, Sugriva—a mere forest {{dwelling}} monkey—is fatigued by his past hardships and is relaxing, but not partaking in carnal pleasures. Tara informs Sugriva that Vali {{told her that}} Ravana is a mighty king with several rakshasas in his service. She reminds Lakshmana that without an ally like Sugriva, Rama cannot defeat such a powerful foe. Tara informs him that Sugriva has summoned all monkey commanders and troops to the capital. Adhyatma Ramayana also presents a similar description, where Tara, Angada and Hanuman are sent by Sugriva to calm Lakshmana. In a condensed one-verse description, Ramacharitamanasa says that Tara and Hanuman were dispatched by Sugriva and were successful in appeasing Lakshmana by singing Rama's praises. In Ramavataram, though not Sugriva's consort, Tara pacifies Lakshamana. The usual epithet of Tara, lustrous as the moon, in Ramavataram signifies her white clothes, <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> widow. Lakshmana is reminded of his own widowed mother seeing Tara.|$|E

25|$|The main {{difference}} is that IEEE arithmetic replaces the real (and transreal) number zero with positive and negative zero.

25|$|The system {{therefore}} allows {{addition of}} negative operands without a subtraction circuit and a circuit that detects <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number.

To perform this, the circuit merely pretends an extra left-most bit of 1 exists.|$|E

25|$|ENIAC was a modular computer, {{composed}} of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators {{which could not}} only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or trays, as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it could trigger different operations, depending on <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> computed result.|$|E
25|$|Significance {{testing has}} been the favored {{statistical}} tool in some experimental social sciences (over 90% of articles in the Journal of Applied Psychology during the early 1990s). Other fields have favored the estimation of parameters (e.g., effect size). Significance testing {{is used as a}} substitute for the traditional comparison of predicted value and experimental result {{at the core of the}} scientific method. When theory is only capable of predicting <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relationship, a directional (one-sided) hypothesis test can be configured so that only a statistically significant result supports theory. This form of theory appraisal is the most heavily criticized application of hypothesis testing.|$|E

The new architectonic canons that, however, left the existing Gothic Roman elements untouched {{are reflected in the}} transformation of the buildings. Also the ancient noble mansions embellished by magnificent portals were restructured and, {{toward the end of the}} 19th century, also the cultural level of the city rose again, thanks to the growing welfare. In fact, in this period, other institutions and congregations were born, which, together with the constitution of various schools, made Anagni an important centre of study thanks to its long cultural tradition.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{upon the}} format of the match, these two {{strategies}} will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good cricket captain {{to be able to tell}} which strategy is most appropriate in any set of circumstances and the best way of implementing it.|$|E

500|$|When a kelpie {{appeared}} in its equine persona without any tack, {{it could be}} captured using a halter stamped with <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cross, and its strength could then be harnessed in tasks such as the transportation of heavy mill stones. One folk tale describes how the Laird of Morphie captured a kelpie {{and used it to}} carry stones to build his castle. Once the work was complete, the laird released the kelpie, which was evidently unhappy about its treatment. The curse it issued before leaving– [...] "Sair back and sair banes/ Drivin' the Laird o' Morphies's stanes,/ The Laird o' Morphie'll never thrive/ As lang's the kelpy is alive"– was popularly believed to have resulted in the extinction of the laird's family. Some kelpies were said to be equipped with a bridle and sometimes a saddle, and {{appeared in}}vitingly ready to ride, but if mounted they would run off and drown their riders. If the kelpie was already wearing a bridle, exorcism might be achieved by removing it. A bridle taken from a kelpie was endowed with magical properties, and if brandished towards someone, was able to transform that person into a horse or pony.|$|E

500|$|... "Camping" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators praising {{the performance of}} Rashida Jones and the new comedic direction her character was taking. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com praised how the script featured the entire ensemble cast together, rather than in separate subplots like recent episodes. He also enjoyed the developments with Ann's character, claiming it gave Jones more opportunities to shine than past episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she particularly enjoyed the jokes involving Jerry's character, and said she enjoyed that Ann once again misinterpreted Chris, although she said the joke was predictable. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said the episode was not as funny as the previous episode, [...] "Harvest Festival", but said [...] "if this is what qualifies as a (slightly) down episode for the show, then that's <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comedy that's hitting for a very high average".

500|$|By 1922, Kilner's bowling had {{improved}} {{to the point}} where he passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, taking 122 at an average of 14.72, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship. Wisden recognised this was the first season when he was a front-line bowler, [...] " [...] his previous form far behind." [...] In the first five games of the campaign, he took 21 wickets for 142 runs. In the match against Essex, he claimed ten wickets in a match for the first time, taking eleven for 51 runs. Against Hampshire, he took ten wickets for 90 runs, including six for 13 in the second innings as Hampshire were bowled out for 44. At the same time, he maintained his batting form, having a similar record to the previous season. He scored 1,198 runs at 27.22 and scored two centuries. This meant he completed the double—regarded as <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quality all-round cricketer—for the first time. Kilner was fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages and fourth in the bowling averages. At the end of the season, he was again selected for CI Thornton's XI, as well as in two games at Eastbourne. Over the English winter, Kilner accepted a job coaching for the Maharaja of Patiala in India. He played in several first-class matches, and enjoyed himself enough to return the following winter.|$|E
500|$|King Æthelwulf's {{ring was}} found in a cart rut in Laverstock in Wiltshire in about August 1780 by one William Petty, who sold it to a {{silversmith}} in Salisbury. The silversmith sold it to the Earl of Radnor, and the earl's son, William, donated it to the British Museum in 1829. The ring, together with a similar ring of Æthelwulf's daughter Æthelswith, is one of two key examples of nielloed 9th-century metalwork. They appear to represent the emergence of a [...] "court style" [...] of West Saxon metalwork, characterised by an unusual Christian iconography, such as a pair of peacocks at the Fountain of Life on the Æthelwulf ring, associated with Christian immortality. The ring is inscribed [...] "Æthelwulf Rex", firmly associating it with the King, and the inscription forms part of the design, so it cannot have been added later. Many of its features are typical of 9th-century metalwork, such as the design of two birds, beaded and speckled borders, and a saltire with arrow-like terminals on the back. It was probably manufactured in Wessex, but was typical of the uniformity of animal ornament in England in the 9th century. In the view of Leslie Webster, an expert on medieval art: [...] "Its fine Trewhiddle style ornament would certainly fit a mid ninth-century date." [...] In Nelson's view, [...] "it was surely made to be a gift from this royal lord to a brawny follower: <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful ninth-century kingship". The art historian David Wilson sees it as a survival of the pagan tradition of the generous king as the [...] "ring-giver".|$|E
