40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, which was carried out {{under the auspices of}} the DGRST, was to {{determine}} the best way to use geothermal hot water for residential space heating. It quickly became apparent that the type of heating apparatus used in the housing units was most important and that heat pumps could be a valuable asset, making it possible to extract even more geothermal heat and thus substantially improve the cost benefit of the systems. Many factors play a significant role in this problem. Therefore, after a first stage devoted to analyzing the problem through a manual method which proved quite useful, the systematic consideration of all important aspects led us to use a computer to optimize solutions and process a large number of cases. The software used for this general study can also be used to work out particular cases: it is now available to any interested party through DGRST. This program makes it possible to: (1) take climatic conditions into account in a very detailed manner, including temperatures as well as insolation. 864 cases corresponding to 36 typical days divided into 24 hours each were chosen to represent the heating season. They make it possible to define the heating needs of any type of housing unit. (2) simulate and analyze the behavior in practice of a geothermal heating system when heat is extracted from the well by a simple heat exchanger. This simulation makes it possible to evaluate the respective qualities of various types of heating apparatus which can be used in homes. It also makes it possible to define the best control systems for the central system and substations and to assess quite accurately the presence of terminal controls, such as radiators with <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valves.</b> (3) determine to what extent the addition of a heat pump makes it possible to improve the cost benefit of geothermal heating. When its average characteristics and heating use conditions (price, coefficient of performance, length of utilization, electrical rates, etc.) are taken into account, the heat pump should not be scaled for maximum heating power. Consequently, the program considers several possible sizes, with different installation schemes, and selects for each case the value which corresponds to the lowest cost of heating...|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{hot water}} recirculation system uses a dedicated return {{line from the}} point of use located farthest from the hot water tank back to the hot water tank. In homes where this return line was not installed the cold water line is used as a return line. The first of two system types has a pump mounted at the hot water heater while a [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater and closes once hot water contacts the <b>valve</b> to <b>control</b> crossover flow between the hot and cold lines. A second type of system uses a <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> pump which gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater. These <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> pumps often have a built-in [...] "normally closed" [...] check-valve which prevents water in the cold water line from entering into the hot water line. Compared to a dedicated return line, using the cold water line as a return has the disadvantage of heating the cold water pipe (and the contained water). Accurate temperature monitoring and active flow control can minimize loss of cold water within the cold water line.|$|R

When {{a significant portion of}} a population of <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads is forced to change their on-off state simultaneously, the aggregate power demand of such population presents large, underdamped oscillations, a well-known phenomenon referred to by power utilities as “cold-load pickup”.

5000|$|While the {{majority}} of these pumps mount nearest to the hot water heater and have no adjustable temperature capabilities, a significant reduction in energy can be achieved by using a temperature adjustable <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> circulation pump mounted at the last fixture on the loop. <b>Thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> circulation pumps allow owners to choose the desired temperature of hot water to be maintained within the hot water pipes since most homes do not require [...] degree water instantly out of their taps. <b>Thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> circulation pumps cycle on and off to maintain a user's chosen temperature and consume less energy than a continuously operating pump. By installing a <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> pump just after the farthest fixture on the loop, cyclic pumping maintains ready hot water up to the last fixture on the loop instead of wasting energy heating the piping from the last fixture to the water heater. Often installing a circulation pump at the farthest fixture on hot water circulation loop due to limited available space, cosmetics, noise restrictions or lack of available power. Recent advancements in hot water circulation technology allow for benefiting from temperature controlled pumping without having to install the pump at the last fixture on the hot water loop. These advanced hot water circulation systems utilize a water contacting temperature probe strategically installed at the last fixture on the loop to minimize the energy wasted heating lengthy return pipes. Thermal insulation applied to the pipes helps mitigate this second loss and minimize the amount of water that must be pumped to keep hot water constantly available.|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} impacts of price {{responsive}} demand on the electric power system requires better load models. This paper discusses the modeling of uncertainties in aggregated <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads using a state queueing (SQ) model. The cycling times of <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> appliances (TCAs) vary with the TCA types and sizes, {{as well as the}} ambient temperatures. The random consumption of consumers, which shortens or prolongs a specific TCA cycling period, introduces another degree of uncertainty. By modifying the state transition matrix, these random factors can be taken into account in a discrete SQ model. The impacts of considering load diversity in the SQ model while simulating TCA setpoint response are also studied. Comment: 9 pages, 19 figures, accepted to IEEE Transactions on Power System...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: During service restoration, {{the power}} level at buses can {{significantly}} {{differ from the}} one presented under steady-state conditions, demanding an amount of electric power {{significantly higher than the}} normal load. Hence, their post-outage behavior must be adequately forecasted in order to permit the development of reliable restoration plans, or to avoid inadequate actions that may lead to a subsequent shutdown of the electric power system. This problem is known in the literature as cold load pick-up and the <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads can be pointed as the main responsible for this behavior. Approach: This study proposes a methodology to model the <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> load behavior during the reenergization process, based on object oriented programming and the physical modeling of individual loads, avoiding the explicitly modeling of the electric distribution feeder. In this context, the load aggregation is also implemented using “feeder” classes in an hierarchical structure. Results: The methodology was tested considering distinct devices distributed along a hypothetical feeder and the results show the impacts of interruption duration and environmental temperature in the load behavior. Conclusion: The Cold-load phenomena can be successfully simulated based on physical parameters of <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads using object-oriented programming, yielding satisfactory results.
