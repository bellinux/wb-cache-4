5|$|The {{result was}} a {{sequence}} of innovative but unpopular financial measures. John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total {{during the reign of}} the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied {{in the absence of any}} actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony. The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; £44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders. John created a new <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown. John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay.|$|E

Our analysis concerns the direct taxes and indirect taxes. Direct taxes have the following structure: current <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> capital. Current <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> are made up of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and other current <b>taxes.</b> <b>Taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> consist of <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> personal <b>income</b> and the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the revenue or profit of companies. Indirect taxes consist of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and imports, which in turn are composed of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and other <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production. The <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production consist of: Value Added <b>Tax,</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> imports excluding VAT and <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production excluding VAT and duties. Analysis of main trends of taxation in the European Union countries will be achieved by calculating several indicators, namely: fixed-base indices, chain-based indices, minimum, maximum, average, percentages and percentages of total GDP. </p...|$|R

25|$|The IRS {{originated}} with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, a federal office created in 1862 {{to assess the}} nation's first income tax, which was {{to raise funds for}} the American Civil War. The temporary measure provided over a fifth of the Union's war expenses and was allowed to expire a decade later. In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified authorizing Congress to impose a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income,</b> and the Bureau of Internal Revenue was established. In 1953, the agency was renamed the Internal Revenue Service and significantly reorganized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 modernized the IRS and restructured it along a private sector model.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> {{in excess of}} this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as high as it is for those in the top fifth.|$|E

The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution later overruled the Pollock decision and made clear that there was no requirement for apportionment of income taxes. Later still, in Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., the Supreme Court reviewed Pollock, the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909 and the Sixteenth Amendment, and concluded that Congress had always had the unfettered power to tax income, as set forth in Springer.|$|E

25|$|In 1895 the United States Supreme Court, in its {{ruling in}} Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., held a tax based on {{receipts}} {{from the use}} of property to be unconstitutional. The Court held that taxes on rents from real estate, on interest income from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes dividend income) were treated as direct taxes on property, and therefore had to be apportioned (divided among the states based on their populations). Since apportionment of income taxes is impractical, this had the effect of prohibiting a federal <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> from property. However, the Court affirmed that the Constitution did not deny Congress the power to impose a tax on real and personal property, and it affirmed that such would be a direct tax. Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical {{from the time of the}} Pollock decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below).|$|E

500|$|In 1530, {{during the}} reign of Henry VIII, a {{proclamation}} was issued, describing idleness as the [...] "mother and root of all vices" [...] and ordering that whipping should replace the stocks as the punishment for vagabonds. This change was confirmed in the 1531 Vagabonds Act the following year, with one important change: it directed the justices of the peace to assign to the impotent poor an area within which they are to beg. Generally, the licences to beg for the impotent poor were limited to the disabled, sick, and elderly. An impotent person begging out of his area was to be imprisoned for two days and nights in the stocks, on bread and water, and then sworn to return to the place in which he was authorized to beg. An able-bodied beggar was to be whipped, and sworn to return to the place where he was born, or last dwelt for the space of three years, and there put himself to labour. Still no provision was made, though, for the healthy man simply unable to find work. All able-bodied unemployed were put into the same category. Those unable to find work had a stark choice: starve or break the law. In 1535, a bill was drawn up calling {{for the creation of a}} system of public works to deal with the problem of unemployment, to be funded by a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and capital. A law passed a year later allowed vagabonds to be whipped.|$|E
