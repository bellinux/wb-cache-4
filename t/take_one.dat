5|$|During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets.

Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|From the start, all {{subjects}} of the IB Diploma Programme were available in English and French, and it was mandatory for all students to study both a first and a second language.

The IB Diploma Programme subjects became available in Spanish in 1983.|$|E

5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only <b>take</b> <b>one</b> year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled {{to such an extent}} that the running plate was the only component recognisable to the casual observer.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and <b>take</b> <b>one</b> half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1944, 'D' Company {{left the}} {{battalion}} camp at Bulford in Wiltshire for RAF Tarrant Rushton in Dorset. The base was then secured and Howard briefed everyone on the mission, distributing photographs of the bridges and unveiling {{a model of the}} area. Glider pilot commander Staff Sergeant Jim Wallwork told Howard that with a full load of men, ammunition, assault boats and engineers' stores his gliders would be dangerously overloaded. Howard decided to only <b>take</b> <b>one</b> assault boat per glider and leave behind two men from each platoon.

5|$|Crisis Core is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player controls Zack Fair. The player moves Zack through and between open areas, allowing him to talk with non-player characters, interact with the environment, and engage monsters in battle. At save points, the player may opt to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of the available side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E

5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or <b>take</b> <b>one</b> and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to take individual higher education courses in Commerce from the Business School in Kambsdalur and in Tórshavn.

5|$|Joyce {{returned}} to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, {{to visit his}} father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste he decided to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time {{as a representative of}} some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He {{returned to}} Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent {{the rest of her life}} on the continent, eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, Smith and Mulder's car {{runs out}} of gas. Walking the last few miles on foot, they come across the corpse of the electrician, grossly {{decomposed}} and covered in ants. Jeremiah takes Mulder to a mysterious field where they find a group of identical children; the girls all resemble Samantha at the age when she was abducted. Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to tend the fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of the female clones with him. However, the Bounty Hunter arrives and chases them.

5|$|On October 18, 2010, jury {{selection}} commenced in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia before Judge Gerald I. Fisher. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez presented {{the names of}} potential witnesses for the trial, including FBI agent Brad Garrett and the two women whom Guandique was convicted of assaulting. At {{the start of the}} trial, the prosecution's case was expected to take around four weeks and the defense was expected to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> day. On October 25 and 26, Halle Shilling and Christy Wiegand testified about being attacked by Guandique while independently jogging in Rock Creek Park. Wiegand recounted that Guandique grabbed her from behind, dragged her down a ravine and held a knife against her face.|$|E

Chelsea offered Terry counselling {{as a result of}} his devastation following the miss of his penalty, and subsequently, the loss of the final. Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing. Terry also wrote an open letter, published on Chelsea's official website, apologising for missing the penalty and costing Chelsea the trophy. Nicolas Anelka, who took the decisive kick, revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty, citing lack of warm-up time.|$|E

5|$|As with so {{many other}} parts of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may <b>take</b> <b>one</b> of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E
5|$|Despite her injury, McLeod {{returned}} to the pitch quickly, starting in three games at the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifier in February 2016 where she recorded two shutouts. On February 19, McLeod joined the national team for their semifinal match against Costa Rica. In the warmup for the game, she again injured her right knee and left the warmup early. However, she played all 90 minutes of the match. Following the tournament, she {{returned to}} Sweden to play with her club team, FC Rosengård. In March 2016, her knee collapsed after kicking a ball while playing with FC Rosengård. It was revealed that she had torn her ACL in her right knee for the third time. Later, her surgeon stated that the injury had most likely occurred in the warmup before Canada's match against Costa Rica. McLeod has stated that her recovery is expected to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> to two years and plans {{to be back on}} the field in February or March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only <b>take</b> <b>one</b> hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E
