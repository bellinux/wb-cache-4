5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the <b>tokamak</b> concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E
25|$|In Tokamaks, the Tore Supra {{was under}} {{construction}} {{over the middle}} of the eighties (1983 to 1988). This was a <b>Tokamak</b> built in Cadarache, France. In 1983, the JET was completed and first plasmas achieved. In 1985, the Japanese <b>tokamak,</b> JT-60 was completed. In 1988, the T-15 a Soviet <b>tokamak</b> was completed. It was the first industrial fusion reactor to use superconducting magnets to control the plasma. These were Helium cooled.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s the {{prospect}} of fusion power was strongly considered sparking research at ORNL. A <b>tokamak</b> called ORMAK, made operational in 1971, was the first <b>tokamak</b> to achieve a plasma temperature of 20 million Kelvin.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the process behind fusion reaction, the magnetic confinement of plasma to sustain fusion reactions, {{different kinds of}} <b>tokamaks</b> used for the magnetic plasma confinement, the operation of <b>tokamaks,</b> and the control of <b>tokamaks.</b> Control of <b>tokamaks</b> concerns the basic functions of plasma initiation, shaping, heating, current drive, stabilization, and safe termination of charges...|$|R

Interest in high field non-superconducting <b>tokamaks</b> was strong after the US left the ITER project at the end of 1999. This class of <b>tokamaks,</b> including Alcator C-Mod, IGNITOR, and FIRE, has many challenging and interesting structural characteristics. Structural behavior of these <b>tokamaks</b> is discussed along with the special structural features employed to sustain the huge loads resulting from their high fields. This paper was originally intended {{to be a part of}} a special journal on high field <b>tokamaks</b> that was canceled with the renewed interest in ITER...|$|R
25|$|In 1950 he {{proposed}} {{an idea for}} a controlled nuclear fusion reactor, the <b>tokamak,</b> which is still the basis for the majority of work in the area. Sakharov, in association with Igor Tamm, proposed confining extremely hot ionized plasma by torus shaped magnetic fields for controlling thermonuclear fusion that {{led to the development of}} the <b>tokamak</b> device.|$|E
25|$|Spherical tokamak: {{also known}} as spherical torus A {{variation}} on the <b>tokamak</b> with a spherical shape.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} concern {{comes from the}} 2013 <b>tokamak</b> {{parameters}} database interpolation which says that power load on <b>tokamak</b> divertors will be five times the expected value for ITER and much more for actual electricity-generating reactors. Given that the projected power load on the ITER divertor is already very high, these new findings mean that new divertor designs should be urgently tested. However, the corresponding test facility (ADX) still has not received any funding.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with plasma edge turbulence {{and its relation to}} anomalous particle transport in <b>tokamaks.</b> First, experimental evidence of turbulence driven particle transport and measurements of the gradients of the equilibrium profiles in the Brazilian <b>tokamaks</b> TBR and TCABR are presented. Next, diffusion in a two drift-wave system is discussed. In this nonintegrable system, particle transport is associated with the onset of chaotic orbits. Finally, numerical evidence suggesting that a nonlinear three-mode interaction could contribute to the intermittent plasma fluctuations observed in <b>tokamaks</b> is presented...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{to measure}} the {{inventory}} of dust particles and to remove dust if it approaches safety limits will be required in next-step <b>tokamaks</b> such as ITER. An electrostatic dust detector, based on a fine grid of interlocking circuit traces, biased to 30 or 50 V, has been developed {{for the detection of}} dust on remote surfaces in air and vacuum environments. Gaining operational experience of dust detection on surfaces in <b>tokamaks</b> is important, however the level of dust generated in contemporary short-pulse <b>tokamaks</b> is comparatively low and high sensitivity is necessary to measure dust on a shot-by-shot basis. We report on modifications in the detection electronics that have increased the sensitivity of the electrostatic dust detector by a factor of up to 120, - a level suitable for measurements on contemporary <b>tokamaks...</b>|$|R
25|$|Other {{planned and}} {{proposed}} fusion reactors include DEMO, Wendelstein 7-X, NIF, HiPER, and MAST, {{as well as}} CFETR (China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor), a 200MW <b>tokamak.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over the years, fusion {{researchers}} have investigated various confinement concepts. The early {{emphasis was on}} three main systems: z-pinch, stellarator and magnetic mirror. The current leading designs are the <b>tokamak</b> and inertial confinement (ICF) by laser. Both designs are being built at very large scales, most notably the ITER <b>tokamak</b> in France, and the National Ignition Facility laser in the USA. Researchers are also studying other designs that may offer cheaper approaches. Among these alternatives there is increasing interest in magnetized target fusion and inertial electrostatic confinement.|$|E
25|$|The early 2000s saw the {{founding}} {{of a number of}} privately backed fusion companies pursuing innovative approaches with the stated goal of developing commercially viable fusion power plants. Secretive startup Tri Alpha Energy, founded in 1998, began exploring a field-reversed configuration approach. In 2002, Canadian company General Fusion began proof-of-concept experiments based on a hybrid magneto-inertial approach called Magnetized Target Fusion. These companies are funded by private investors including Jeff Bezos (General Fusion) and Paul Allen (Tri Alpha Energy). Toward the end of the decade, UK-based fusion company <b>Tokamak</b> Energy started exploring spherical <b>tokamak</b> devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{confinement}} of plasma in {{devices such}} as <b>tokamaks,</b> spherical <b>tokamaks,</b> and reversed field pinches requires the presence of closed magnetic flux surfaces. By changing the magnetic topology, magnetic reconnection degrades confinement by disrupting these closed flux surfaces, allowing the hot central plasma to mix with cooler plasma closer to the wall.|$|R

25|$|In August, 2015, MIT {{announced}} a <b>tokamak</b> it named ARC fusion reactor design using rare-earth barium-copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting tapes to produce high-magnetic field coils that it claimed produce comparable magnetic field strength {{in a smaller}} configuration than other designs.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the EC, Japan, United States, and USSR {{joined in}} the International <b>Tokamak</b> Reactor (INTOR) Workshop, {{under the auspices of}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to assess the {{readiness}} of magnetic fusion to move forward to the experimental power reactor (EPR) stage, to identify the additional R that must be undertaken, and to define the characteristics of such an EPR by means of a conceptual design. Hundreds of fusion scientists and engineers in each participating country took part in a detailed assessment of the then present status of the <b>tokamak</b> confinement concept vis-a-vis the requirements of an EPR, identified the required R by early 1980, and produced a conceptual design by mid-1981.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, at the Geneva {{summit meeting}} in 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev {{suggested}} to Ronald Reagan {{that the two}} countries jointly undertake {{the construction of a}} <b>tokamak</b> EPR as proposed by the INTOR Workshop. The ITER project was initiated in 1988.|$|E
40|$|Steady-state {{long pulse}} {{operation}} of <b>tokamaks</b> requires fully non-inductive current drive, thus an external current drive method.

25|$|At {{the final}} meeting in Moscow on 28 June 2005, the {{participating}} parties agreed to construct ITER at Cadarache in Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te-d'Azur, France. Construction of the ITER complex began in 2007, while {{assembly of the}} <b>tokamak</b> itself was scheduled to begin in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Tokamak: {{the most}} {{well-developed}} and well-funded approach to fusion energy. This method races hot plasma {{around in a}} magnetically confined, donut-shaped ring, with an internal current. When completed, ITER will be the world's largest <b>tokamak.</b> As of April 2012 an estimated 215 experimental tokamaks were either planned, decommissioned or currently operating (35) worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, in 1968, the {{international}} meeting {{was being held}} in Novosibirsk where Soviet results with the T-3 <b>tokamak</b> were first released. This overshadowed a paper by Robinson and King that had examined the quiescence period and determined {{it was due to}} the original toroidal magnetic field reversing itself, creating a more stable configuration.|$|E
40|$|A "carpet" of {{torsional}} Alfven waves, resonantly excited in {{an annulus}} inside a toroidal conducting vessel, could maintain magnetized plasma {{inside of the}} annulus against the inherent outward expansion. Such toroidal magnetic confinement for fusion could present some advantages over conventional <b>tokamaks.</b> The idea {{could also be used}} to stabilize interchange and ballooning modes in <b>tokamaks</b> and other interchange-limited fusion devices...|$|R
40|$|Present day stellarators have aspect ratios large {{compared}} to those of <b>tokamaks.</b> The transport optimized stellarators under construction, W 7 X and HSX, have aspect ratios R/(a) = 11 and 8 respectively.

40|$|Attaining {{the highest}} {{performance}} in poloidally diverted <b>tokamaks</b> requires resonant magnetic perturbation coils to avoid core instabilities (locked, resistive wall and neoclassical tearing modes). These coils also perturb the pedestal and edge region, causing varying degrees of stochasticity with remnant islands. The effects of the DIII-D locked mode control coil on the edge and core of Ohmic plasmas are modeled with the field line integration code TRIP 3 D and compared with experimental measurements. Without detailed profile analysis and field line integration, {{it is difficult to}} establish whether a given response is due to a ''core mode'' or an ''edge stochastic boundary. '' In diverted Ohmic plasmas, the boundary stochastic layer displays many characteristics associated with such layers in non-diverted <b>tokamaks.</b> Comparison with stochastic boundary results from non-diverted <b>tokamaks</b> indicates that a significant difference in diverted <b>tokamaks</b> is a ''focusing'' of the magnetic field line loss into the vicinity of the divertor...|$|R
25|$|Bussard, who {{had been}} an {{advocate}} for <b>Tokamak</b> research, turned to advocate for this concept, so that the idea became associated with his name. In 1995 he {{sent a letter to}} the USCongress stating that he had only supported Tokamaks in order to get fusion research sponsored by the government, but he now believed that there were better alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Many critics accuse ITER {{researchers}} {{of being}} unwilling {{to face up}} to the technical and economic potential problems posed by <b>tokamak</b> fusion schemes. The expected cost of ITER has risen from $5 billion USD to $20 billion USD, and the timeline for operation at full power was moved from the original estimate of 2016 to 2027.|$|E
25|$|For many decades, cusped {{confinement}} never behaved experimentally as was predicted. Sharply bent {{fields were}} used by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{in a series of}} magnetic mirror machines from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. After hundreds of millions were spent, the machines still leaked plasma at the field ends. Many scientists shifted focus onto looping the fields, into a <b>tokamak.</b> Eventually it was thought that cusped confinement effect did not exist.|$|E
50|$|FRCs and spherical <b>tokamaks</b> are of {{interest}} to the plasma physics community because of their confinement properties and their small size. While most large fusion experiments in the world are <b>tokamaks,</b> FRCs and STs are seen as a viable alternative because of their higher Beta, meaning the same power output could be produced from a smaller volume of plasma, and their good plasma stability.|$|R
50|$|In large <b>tokamaks</b> {{with larger}} Lundquist numbers, {{sawtooth}} relaxations are observed to occur {{much faster than}} predicted by the resistive Kadomtsev model. Simulations using two-fluid model equations or non-ideal terms in Ohm's law besides the resistive term, such as the Hall and electron inertia terms, can account for the fast crash times observed in hot <b>tokamaks.</b> These models can allow much faster reconnection at low resistivity.|$|R
50|$|Some MFE work {{continued}} through this period, {{almost all of}} it using spheromaks as accessory devices for other reactors. Caltech and INRS-EMT in Canada both used accelerated spheromaks as a way to refuel <b>tokamaks.</b> Others studied the use of spheromaks to inject helicity into <b>tokamaks,</b> eventually leading to the Helicity Injected Spherical Torus (HIST) device and similar concepts for a number of existing devices.|$|R
