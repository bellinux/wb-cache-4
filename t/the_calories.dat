5|$|The {{sea otter}} has a {{metabolic}} rate {{two or three}} times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn <b>the</b> <b>calories</b> necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of <b>the</b> <b>calories</b> came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> <b>Calorie</b> (kcal) {{of present}} U. S. food labels {{is similar to}} the {{original}} French definition of 1825. The original published source (now available on the internet) defined <b>the</b> <b>Calorie</b> as <b>the</b> quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water from 0 to 1 °C. <b>The</b> <b>Calorie</b> originated in studies concerning fuel efficiency for the steam engine and had entered dictionaries by 1840. It was the only energy unit in English dictionaries available to W. O. Atwater in 1887 for his popular articles on food and tables of food composition. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>Calorie</b> became <b>the</b> preferred unit of potential energy in nutrition science and dietetics, but was displaced when the joule, g-calorie and kcal were introduced. This article will explain the context in which Nicolas Clément-Desormes defined <b>the</b> original <b>Calorie</b> and <b>the</b> depth of his collaboration with Sadi Carnot. It will review the history of other energy units and show how <b>the</b> original <b>Calorie</b> was usurped during the period of international standardization. As a result, no form of <b>the</b> <b>Calorie</b> is recognized as an SI unit. It is untenable to continue to use the same word for different thermal units (g-calorie and kg-calorie) and to use different words for <b>the</b> same unit (<b>Calorie</b> and kcal). <b>The</b> only valid use of <b>the</b> <b>Calorie</b> is in common speech and public nutrition education. To avoid ongoing confusion, scientists should complete the transition to the joule and cease using kcal in any context. </p...|$|R

The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.|$|E
25|$|The {{profound}} {{weight loss}} which occurs after bariatric surgery {{is due to}} taking in much less energy (calories) than the body needs to use every day. Fat tissue must be burned to offset the deficit, and weight loss results. Eventually, as the body becomes smaller, its energy requirements are decreased, while the patient simultaneously finds it possible to eat somewhat more food. When the energy consumed is equal to <b>the</b> <b>calories</b> eaten, weight loss will stop. Proximal GBP typically results in loss of 6080% of excess body weight, and very rarely leads to excessive weight loss. The risk of excessive weight loss is slightly greater with distal GBP.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{therapeutic diet}} for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories {{to maintain the}} correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned {{with the introduction of}} effective anticonvulsant drugs. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 [...] ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half <b>the</b> <b>calories.</b> As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.|$|E
