Favreau explained that marketing would show [...] "only a brief glimpse of the aliens of the title" [...] before the film is released.

NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> advertiser sensitivity to it.

500|$|Al-Tamimi, {{during his}} trial, {{repeatedly}} questioned {{the legitimacy of}} the Israeli military court trying him as well as Israeli regulations regarding public gatherings. The military judge ultimately found him guilty of sending stone-throwers and illegal protesting but cleared him of the two more serious charges. She stated that testimony from a 14-year-old witness had been inconsistent and therefore unusable and that she had found misrepresentations by interrogators about the content of the confession of another witness. Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak described al-Tamimi's partial exoneration as a [...] "miracle" [...] given the 99.74 percent conviction rate of the military court. Before his sentencing al-Tamimi stated that [...] "the laws come from an occupying regime whose legitimacy I do not recognise. I don't think even for a single minute that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> justice done." [...] His lawyer denied al-Tamimi's involvement in stone throwing, stating that al-Tamimi believed in passive resistance.|$|E

500|$|Conservatives and isolationists {{had little}} {{enthusiasm for the}} Willkie campaign, and the moderates wanted to see {{stronger}} positions on progressive issues and foreign policy. Publisher Henry Luce decried both Roosevelt and Willkie for failing {{to be honest with}} the American people, [...] "America will never be ready for any war until she makes her mind up <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a war." [...] (italics in original) Despite his pledge not to campaign, Roosevelt made inspection tours to military installations, well covered by the press. The president did not mention Willkie by name, seeking to avoid giving him publicity. [...] According to Susan Dunn in her book in the 1940 campaign, this forced Willkie [...] "to box against a phantom opponent and carry on a one-sided partisan debate... Even in Willkie's speeches, Roosevelt occupied center stage". Willkie promised to keep New Deal social welfare programs intact, expand Social Security, and provide full employment, a job for everyone: [...] "I pledge a new world".|$|E

As a consequence, all clothing manufacturers and retailers in Sweden banned the purchase of wool from sheep that have been mulesed.

The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous.

2500|$|Later that day, the Supreme Court {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it had ordered the army to remove Zelaya from office. The Supreme Court stated [...] "The armed forces, in charge of supporting the constitution, acted to defend the state of law and {{have been forced to}} apply legal dispositions against those who have expressed themselves publicly and acted against the dispositions of the basic law". On 30 June, the military's chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza Membreño, showed a detention order, signed 26 June by a Supreme Court judge, which ordered the armed forces to detain the president, identified by his full name of José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, at his home in the Tres Caminos area of the capital. It cited him for treason and abuse of authority, among other charges. Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order: [...] "In the moment that we took him out of the country, in the way that he was taken out, there is a crime. Because of the circumstances of the moment this crime occurred, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a justification and cause for acquittal that will protect us." [...] He said the decision was taken by the military leadership [...] "in order to avoid bloodshed". He said [...] "What was more beneficial, remove this gentleman from Honduras or present him to prosecutors and have a mob assault and burn and destroy and for us to have to shoot?" [...] Colonel Inestroza also commented that Zelaya's allegiance to Hugo Chávez was hard to stomach and [...] "It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible. I personally would have retired, because my thinking, my principles, would not have allowed me to participate in that." ...|$|E
