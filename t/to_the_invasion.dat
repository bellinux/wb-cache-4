2500|$|On 2 November 1956 the First Sea Lord Admiral Mountbatten sent {{a letter}} to Eden telling him <b>to</b> stop <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> before troops landed in the Canal zone as the {{operation}} had already proved to be too costly politically. The next day, Mountbatten made a desperate phone call to Eden asking for permission <b>to</b> stop <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> before it began, only to be refused. Mountbatten's views led to clash of personalities with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Gerald Templer who supported <b>the</b> <b>invasion.</b> In response <b>to</b> Mountbatten's call <b>to</b> cancel <b>the</b> <b>invasion,</b> Templer penned a memo, which read: ...|$|R

5|$|There were {{significant}} {{weaknesses in the}} KJRM prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion.</b> One was the failure to subordinate the Naval Surveillance Command to respective sectors of Naval Coastal Command, and another was giving responsibility for two sectors of Naval Coastal Command to what were essentially training establishments.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Invasion</b> of Kuwait in 1990 {{by the forces of}} Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Berlin, No.467 Squadron {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of the continent. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of No.5 Group RAF in an assault on Toulouse, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.|$|E

5|$|Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations. They {{were conducted}} {{as part of}} Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. Bodyguard was designed to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion.</b> The London Controlling Section (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSAG) represented {{the bulk of the}} Allied invasion force. FUSAG's existence was fabricated through Operation Fortitude South.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union. In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion,</b> though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 the United Kingdom {{was a major}} {{contributor}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of Iraq, sending a force of over 46,000 military personnel. The British Army controlled southern Iraq, maintained a peace-keeping presence in Basra. All British troops were withdrawn from Iraq by 30 April 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to extend their mandate. One hundred seventy-nine British military personnel died in Iraqi operations. The British Armed Forces returned to Iraq in 2014 as part of Operation Shader to counter the Islamic State (ISIL).|$|E

5|$|In {{the buildup}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan, six F-15s and 161 {{personnel}} {{were sent to}} the Persian Gulf region. The wing also patrolled the skies of the Northeastern United States during this time period. The wing though never deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The wing converted from the F-15A/B to the F-15C/D in 2004. These planes came from Kadena Air Base.|$|E
5|$|Leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion,</b> the RAF {{intensified}} {{its operations}} against German submarines and ships operating near France. Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to {{three of these}} sinkings. Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying naval mines from April, and No.460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and heavy bomber units took part in several minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea and Heligoland Bight. Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No.455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, but occasionally attacked German convoys in the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|Operation Overlord was {{the name}} {{assigned}} {{to the establishment of}} a large-scale lodgement on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune. To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields. Elaborate deceptions, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, were undertaken {{in the months leading up}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion.|$|E

5|$|Overall, 1,177 Australian {{military}} personnel {{were killed in}} western Europe and Britain during the lead-up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of France and the subsequent Normandy Campaign. These losses were higher than those suffered by Australian forces in the Pacific during this period. A total of 44 Australians are buried in Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in the Normandy region. These include men killed in the region prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> and those who died during the fighting in 1944. Of the Australian graves, 17 are located at the Bayeux War Cemetery, six at Saint-Désir de Lisieux, five at Banneville-la-Campagne, four at the Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, three at both Douvres la Délivrande and Hermanville-sur-Mer, two in Ranville and one each at Ryes-Nazenville, Saint-Manvieu-Norrey, Bolbec and Tilly-sur-Seulles. The Bayeux Memorial, which lists the names of Commonwealth personnel killed in Normandy with no known grave, does not include any Australians. The most recent burial of an Australian serviceman in Normandy took place in April 2011 when No.453 Squadron pilot Flight Lieutenant Henry Lacy Smith was interred at Ranville War Cemetery. Smith drowned when his Spitfire crash-landed in the River Orne on 11 June 1944, but his body was not recovered until November 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Balkans {{campaign}} {{began on}} 6 April 1941, with multiple objectives. Operation Marita was the codename for the German invasion of Greece, while JG54's Stab, II. Gruppe, and III. Gruppe were committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>invasion</b> of Yugoslavia. During the early missions, JG 54 engaged the Bf 109s of the Jugoslovensko Kraljevsko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo (JKRV—Yugoslav Royal Air Force) in numerous air battles. Philipp claimed two JKRV Bf 109s shot down during a Stuka escort mission {{on the second}} day of operations on 7 April, taking his total to 25 aerial victories.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} squad {{automatic weapon}} in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun.

Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.|$|E
