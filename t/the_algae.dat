5|$|<b>The</b> <b>algae</b> {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain <b>the</b> <b>algae</b> can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject <b>the</b> <b>algae.</b> Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because <b>the</b> <b>algae</b> contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; <b>the</b> <b>algae</b> in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. <b>The</b> <b>algae</b> also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> crustose coralline <b>alga</b> Lithothamnium pseudosorum induces {{high rates}} of {{settlement}} and metamorphosis of larvae of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci). In cases where crustose coralline algae (CCA) induce metamorphosis of marine invertebrate larvae it is normally assumed that the inductive molecules are produced by <b>the</b> <b>alga,</b> but an alternative is that they originate from bacteria on the plant surface. Bioassays using shards of L. pseudosorum treated with several antibiotics, whereby some shards were reinfected with bacteria from <b>the</b> <b>alga,</b> showed that if bacteria populations are depleted then settlement and metamorphosis of larvae of A. planci are inhibited. This demonstrates that bacteria are necessary for induction and suggests that morphogenic substances are produced by bacteria {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> and not directly by <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> itself. However, surface bacteria are not inductive if they are isolated from soluble algal compounds, suggesting either that they require a substrate from <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> to produce <b>the</b> inductive agents or, alternatively but less likely, that compounds from both <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> and bacteria are required. There is no evidence that inductive compounds derive from <b>the</b> <b>alga,</b> since algal cell debris and soluble extracts prepared from <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> do not induce metamorphosis of A. planci. This {{is the first time that}} induction of metamorphosis in a marine invertebrate by CCA has been shown to be mediated by bacteria associated with <b>the</b> <b>alga...</b>|$|R

5|$|The species grows only on {{slightly}} to heavily rotten and barkless deadwood in coniferous forests in cool, moist areas.

B.minutissima has been found growing on the liverwort Lepidozia reptans, although Nowellia curvifolia is the main indicator for the slime mould. In addition to liverworts, Barbeyella is found socialised with monocellular algae. It is assumed that the protoplasmodium phagocytises either <b>the</b> <b>algae</b> or the bacteria on their surface. Other Myxogastria species are often found together with Barbeyella, especially Lepidoderma tigrinum, Lamproderma columbinum and Colloderma oculatum.

5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and <b>the</b> <b>algae</b> swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E

5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, <b>the</b> <b>algae</b> is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
5|$|With their complex {{reproductive}} {{needs and}} permeable skins, amphibians are often {{considered to be}} ecological indicators. In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute {{one of the largest}} parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species {{near the top of the}} food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes. Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it. Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when <b>the</b> <b>algae</b> later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.|$|E

40|$|The role of littorinids in {{structuring}} {{communities is}} discussed. On hard substrates preferential grazing of <b>the</b> dominant <b>algae</b> often enables competitively inferior species {{to utilize the}} rock substrate. Investigations of these systems {{has led to the}} proposal of a number of factors that should be analyzed in order to assess the effect of herbivores on community structure. Some of these factors have been investigated for Littorina mariae Sacchi & Rastelli. L. mariae is a micro-epiphytic grazer browsing the surface covering of epiphytes off <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> Fucus serratus (L.). The relationship between <b>the</b> host <b>alga,</b> F. serratus, and L. mariae is far more intricate than that between winkles and hard substrates as <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> itself is a dynamic resource. L. mariae is spatially and temporally linked to F. serratus. L. mariae is found almost exclusively on <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> and is positively attracted by extracts of <b>the</b> <b>alga.</b> <b>The</b> life history of the winkle is closely synchronized with that of <b>the</b> <b>alga</b> (<b>the</b> winter decrease of L. mariae populations is associated with the seasonal die-back of <b>the</b> host <b>alga).</b> On analysis of the factors considered important to assess herbivory, and examples of the effects of other epiphytic herbivores on algal success, it is suggested that L. mariae could potentially {{play an important role in}} structuring the community of it's host fucoid and that this may influence larger scale community structure. Experimental manipulations are proposed to evaluate these hypotheses. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
