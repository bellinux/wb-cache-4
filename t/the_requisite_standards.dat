40|$|Hearing loss is a {{widespread}} condition that can substantially affect not only auditory functioning but also social functioning. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} demonstrate that auditory rehabilitation can improve social participation in individuals with hearing loss. However, currently, {{there is a lack of}} agreed-upon, gold-standard, hearing-specific outcome measures. Consequently, the primary aim of this research was to develop a high quality measure of hearing-related social participation restrictions for use in research and practice. To achieve this aim, four consecutive studies were carried out using best practice questionnaire design techniques. Study 1 generated content for the Social Participation Restrictions Questionnaire (SPaRQ) through semi-structured interviews with 25 adults with hearing loss and nine hearing healthcare professionals. Study 2 evaluated the content of the measure through a subject matter expert panel with 20 hearing healthcare professionals and cognitive interviews with 14 adults with hearing loss. Study 3 assessed the psychometric properties of the SPaRQ by applying Rasch analysis to data collected from 279 adults with hearing loss. Finally, Study 4 further assessed the psychometric properties of the SPaRQ by applying traditional psychometric analysis to data collected from a further 102 adults with hearing loss. This research led to the development of a 19 -item questionnaire that measured two key elements: social behaviours (e. g. difficulties with social interactions) and social perceptions (e. g. feelings of isolation). There was strong evidence to support the measurement properties of SPaRQ, including construct validity, person separation reliability, and internal consistency. Furthermore, the response scale was statistically justified and respondent burden was minimal. Future research should examine additional measurement properties, such as responsiveness and cross-cultural validity. Also, the best practice techniques used in this research should be applied to other new and existing hearing-specific questionnaires to ensure that they meet <b>the</b> <b>requisite</b> <b>standards</b> for use in clinical trials and clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{performance}} measures {{play an important}} role in the measurement of outcome in patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty. However, many of the commonly used measures lack information on their psychometric properties in this population. The purposes of this study were to examine the reliability and sensitivity to change of the six minute walk test (6 MWT), timed up and go test (TUG), stair measure (ST), and a fast self-paced walk test (SPWT) in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) who subsequently underwent total joint arthroplasty. Methods A sample of convenience of 150 eligible patients, part of an ongoing, larger observational study, was selected. This included 69 subjects who had a diagnosis of hip OA and 81 diagnosed with knee OA with an overall mean age of 63. 7 ± 10. 7 years. Test-retest reliability, using Shrout and Fleiss Type 2, 1 intraclass correlations (ICCs), was assessed preoperatively in a sub-sample of 21 patients at 3 time points during the waiting period prior to surgery. Error associated with the measures' scores and the minimal detectable change at the 90 % confidence level was determined. A construct validation process was applied to evaluate the measures' abilities to detect deterioration and improvement at two different time points post-operatively. The standardized response mean (SRM) was used to quantify change for all measures for the two change intervals. Bootstrapping was used to estimate the 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the SRMs. Results The ICCs (95 % CI) were as follows: 6 MWT 0. 94 (0. 88, 0. 98), TUG 0. 75 (0. 51, 0. 89), ST 0. 90 (0. 79, 0. 96), and the SPWT 0. 91 (0. 81, 0. 97). Standardized response means varied from. 79 to 1. 98, being greatest for the ST and 6 MWT over the studied time intervals.

40|$|Engineering design {{processes}} {{are necessary to}} attain <b>the</b> <b>requisite</b> <b>standards</b> of integrity for high-assurance safety-related systems. Additionally, human factors design initiatives can provide critical insights that parameterise their development. Unfortunately, the popular perception of human factors as a “forced marriage” between engineering and psychology often provokes views where the ‘human factor’ {{is perceived as a}} threat to systems design. Some popular performance-based standards for developing safety-related systems advocate identifying and managing human factors throughout the system lifecycle. However, they also have a tendency to fall short in their guidance on the application of human factors methods and tools, let alone how the outputs generated can be integrated in to various stages of the design process. This case study describes a project that converged engineering with human factors to develop a safety argument for new low-cost railway level crossing technology for system-wide implementation in Australia. The paper enjoins the perspectives of a software engineer and cognitive psychologist and their involvement in the project over two years of collaborative work to develop a safety argument for low-cost level crossing technology. Safety and reliability requirements were informed by applying human factors analytical tools that supported the evaluation and quantification of human reliability where users interfaced with the technology. The project team was confronted with significant challenges in cross-disciplinary engagement, particularly with the complexities of dealing with incongruences in disciplinary language. They were also encouraged to think ‘outside the box’ as to how users of a system interpreted system states and behaviour. Importantly, some of these states, while considered safe within the boundary of the constituent systems that implemented safety-related functions, could actually lead the users to engage in deviant behaviour. Psychology explained how user compliance could be eroded to levels that effectively undermined levels of risk reduction afforded by systems. Linking the engineering and psychology disciplines intuitively, overall safety performance was improved by introducing technical requirements and making design decisions that minimized the system states and behaviours that led to user deviancy. As a commentary on the utility of transdisciplinary collaboration for technical specification, the processes used to bridge the two disciplines are conceptualised in a graphical model...|$|E

40|$|Australia exports a major {{proportion}} of its agricultural production and is {{highly dependent on}} maintaining and developing access to, and competitiveness in, export markets. To preserve Australia’s status as a provider of high quality grain, the majority of Australian primary producers rely on pesticides to protect their crops from pests and diseases, particularly in post-harvest situations. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) supports Australian agriculture by registering and allowing the supply of safe and effective animal health and crop protection products. A residue risk management continuum is established when the effectiveness of chemical registration and control of chemical use regulations is assessed through residue monitoring programs. Programs assess good agricultural practice and provide traceback capacity to investigate areas of concern. Risk communication provides opportunities for continuous improvement. In the early 1960 s, the Australian Government established a non-regulatory body, the national residue survey (NRS). In 2008 - 2009, random monitoring programs were conducted for over 50 commodities (21 grains, five horticultural commodities, 11 fish species, 12 animal species, honey and egg with over 20, 000 samples collected for analytical testing. The NRS grain residue monitoring program {{is presented as a}} case study of the residue risk management continuum demonstrating to overseas markets the high level of residue integrity of Australian grain. Over 4, 000 grain samples are collected and analysed per annum. Most of the samples are collected in the bulk export program where samples are collected from every hatch of every ship loaded at the seventeen Australian grain export terminals. The chemical screens have expanded beyond the multi-residue screen (MRS) insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, to include phosphine, additional herbicides (not included in the MRS), heavy metals and mycotoxins. In its current form, the NRS grains program provides 15 years of residue testing data which demonstrates a very high degree of conformance with Australian MRLs and the import tolerances of overseas trading partners. In addition, trends in residue testing data demonstrate a decline in the frequency of residue detections and the levels of residue detected. To be confident that residue testing results meet <b>the</b> <b>requisite</b> <b>standards,</b> the reliability of the Australian analyses must be assured. The NRS laboratory performance evaluation system has been developed to provide that assurance, using a range of proficiency tests and other techniques in the selection of laboratories for NRS work. Residue testing results are reported against both Australian MRLs and the international MRLs which apply in the relevant export market. NRS maintains databases of overseas MRLs and compares its residue testing results of exported commodities against those standards. Grain marketers receive certificates of analysis, in the form of NRS residue testing results, for each shipment prior to arrival at the overseas market...|$|E

But Pal and Dutta (2008, 2008 b) discuss globalization from below with respect to the subaltern voices that are located at the receiving end of global inequalities and who are generally situated in Africa and other developing areas of the world. Scholars representing these subaltern voices of the global South have also evinced their ethical perspectives which they think should not be ignored.

Roughness is generally defined as an expression of irregularities in the pavement surface which can be measured using different equipments like MERLIN, Bump integrator, Profilometer etc. Among them Bump Integrator is quite simple and less time consuming in case of long road sections. A case study is conducted on low volume roads in West District in Tripura to determine roughness index (RI) using Bump Integrator at the standard speed of 32 km/h.
