They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E

One option is the development of deployable mobile base and port structures. In many ways less expensive than permanent oversea basing facilities, mobile bases/ports could be a solution to some of the current maritime logistics woes of the U. S. By providing an alternative to fixed sea/air bases, the above two problems could be diminished. In addition, mobile overseas base facilities could provide military commanders with new strategic and tactical options during a crisis or conflict. They could give new meaning to the term 2 ̆ 2 disaster relief 2 ̆ 2 or even one day provide new economic options for entire nations. The technology for giant mobile ocean bases exists, but the capability to efficiently produce and use such facilities are still fifteen to twenty years away. In the interim, there is still a need for a mobile base capability. Use of existing offshore construction and mining operations equipment such as various drilling platform designs, giant support barges and floating port construction methods can fill the gap. There is historic and up to date data on the use of such designs for a multitude of purposes, including those stated above. An analysis of currently available equipment and capabilities can aid in making a choice, but as always cost effectiveness is a major factor in the decision. In this case however, there are high stakes in political costs as well as capital costs...|$|R
