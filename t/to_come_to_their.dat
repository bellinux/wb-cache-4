5|$|Despite {{numerous}} attempts {{to break through}} the defensive line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was {{in the hands of the}} Argives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of May, the {{situation}} for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants {{of the city and}} the 30,000–40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control {{of the city and the}} local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid.|$|E
5|$|The 1947 Sun Bowl was the Bearcats' first {{official}} bowl game, but two 1902 post-season games in New Orleans, Louisiana, {{may be considered}} the first bowl games in Cincinnati football history. In 1902, Cincinnati completed a 7-1-1 season, losing only to the Carlisle Indians. Following the conclusion of its football schedule, the Bearcats were invited to New Orleans by the Southern Athletic Club to play a football game on New Year's Day. Cincinnati easily defeated the Athletic Club team, and at the victory party following the win, students from nearby Louisiana State University invited the Cincinnati players <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> school to play another game. That game, which took place a few days later, resulted in a 22–0 Cincinnati win, and may be considered the first bowl game.|$|E

5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this {{way to ensure that}} their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 993, Manjutakin {{launched}} yet another expedition, capturing Apamea and Larissa (Ar. Shayzar) and continuing his raids in the Byzantine province around Antioch, before returning safely to Damascus. In spring 994, Manjutakin once more moved against Aleppo. Responding to the calls for aid by the Hamdanids, Basil II ordered Bourtzes <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid, and sent the magistors Leo Melissenos with reinforcements to Syria. The Byzantine army however was surprised and heavily defeated when attacked on two flanks by Manjutakin in a battle at {{the banks of the}} Orontes, on 15 September 994. Manjutakin went on to capture Azaz and continued his siege of Aleppo until the personal intervention of Basil II in a lightning campaign the next year. These failures, as well as accusations that he had exacerbated the conflict by imprisoning the Fatimid ambassador in 992, brought Basil's displeasure upon Bourtzes, who was replaced with Damian Dalassenos.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of the}} Black Dragons (David Carradine, {{credited}} as Grand Master), pays a {{visit to}} Guam to take the matter into his own hands.

Max and Grand Master reach an agreement that Max will fight Arnold Chon's character to death. If Max wins, Max and the Goody sisters can go free. Max almost deals a deadly blow to the enforcer's head, but stops himself at the last moment, sparing his life, yet winning the fight. He turns over the urn to the yakuza, and receives a priceless katana as a gift. Max and his allies celebrate the end of the adventure in a party. The film ends with Max embracing Jane Goody on a beach during sunset.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{because of}} the {{pressure}} of this European encroachment, some Tlingit appealed to the Russian Orthodox Church. It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the Tlingit language in the 1830s–1840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.|$|E
25|$|As {{could be}} {{imagined}} many communities were {{vying for the}} new college after the bill became law on May 22, 1895. Delegates from Rockford, Freeport, Oregon, Dixon, Fulton and Polo began lobbying the selection committee for the new college <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> towns. Every one of the communities in the running for the new college was a river town. Rockford, Oregon and Polo each had the scenic Rock River as inticement for the new college. Fulton had the Mississippi River. But DeKalb had only the Kishwaukee River, practically a creek compared to the Rock and, of course, the Mississippi. In July 1895 the selection committee, which included Judge A.A. Goodrich of Chicago, visited each of the communities in the running.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov {{arrived in}} Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale. He raised his flag on the newly {{repaired}} Askold. On {{the morning of}} Thursday 10 March 1904, the Russian fleet took to the offensive, and attacked the blockading Japanese squadron, but to little effect. In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined {{the entrance to the}} harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers' return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> rescue.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years {{immediately}} after the expedition, there were disputes and lawsuits between Messner and the expedition leader, Karl-Maria Herrligkoffer. After a quarter-century of peace, the dispute flared up again in October 2001, when Messner raised surprising allegations against {{the other members of}} the team for failing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid. The rest of the team consistently maintained that Reinhold Messner had told them of his idea for crossing the mountain before setting off for the summit. Messner himself asserts, however, that he made a spontaneous decision to descend the Diamir Face together with his brother for reasons of safety. A number of new books—by Max von Kienlin, Hans Saler, Ralf-Peter Märtin, and Reinhold Messner—stoked the dispute (with assumptions and personal attacks) and led to further court proceedings.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Virgin, the Wallflowers {{went back}} to playing Los Angeles clubs in hopes of getting signed with another label. The band found it {{difficult}} to even get label representatives <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> shows. In the year it took to get another record deal the Wallflowers gained and lost several band members. Bass player Barrie Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons in early 1993. The Wallflowers continued playing shows with replacement bass player Jimmie Snider until May 1993 when the band hired Greg Richling. Dylan and Richling went to high school together. The Wallflowers continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through early 1994 when drummer Peter Yanowitz left the band to join his girlfriend Natalie Merchant's band. Interestingly, Yanowitz brought in Barrie Maguire to help record Merchant's debut solo album, Tigerlily. Around the time of Yanowitz's departure the Wallflowers caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine and Tom Whalley of Interscope Records, who then signed the band to their label in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Most {{periphery}} countries rely {{almost entirely}} on agriculture and other natural resources such as oil, coal, and diamonds {{in order to gain}} some sort of profit, but this also keeps them from growing economically. In order for them to grow they must industrialize in order to produce finished goods for exportation around the world, instead of allowing the core countries to profit from their natural resources. Industrializing and adapting newer technology {{is one of the major}} ways in which periphery countries can begin to raise their standard of living and help increase the wealth of their citizens. Becoming industrialized also will help to force trade <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cities, if they can produce goods at competitive prices, allowing them to reach out to the global market and take hold. Once a periphery country can industrialize, and use its own resources to its own benefit, it will begin to enter semi-periphery status.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, a Roman fleet with an {{invasion}} force was underway to northern Iberia. Its commanders, the brothers Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Publius Cornelius Scipio, knew that Hannibal {{had crossed the}} Ebro, but were surprised by the Carthaginian army's presence at the Rhone upstream of their ally Massalia, where they had landed. A scouting party of 300 cavalry was sent to discover the whereabouts of the enemy. These eventually defeated a Carthaginian scouting troop of 500 mounted Numidians and chased {{them back to their}} main camp. Thus, with knowledge of the location of the enemy, the Romans marched upstream, ready for battle. Hannibal evaded this force and by an unknown route reached the Isère or the Durance {{at the foot of the}} Alps in autumn. He also received messengers from his Gallic allies in Italy that urged him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid and offered to guide him over the Alps. Before setting out to cross the Alps, he was re-supplied by a native tribe, some of whose hereditary disputes he had helped solve.|$|E

The following week Phoenix defeated Layla but afterward LayCool assaulted her together until James saved Phoenix. On January 22's SmackDown, in an unusually long segment for the Divas, LayCool held a leaving party for James complete with a pig-shaped cake. Originally Maria came out to defend champion James, but James also appeared to answer LayCool. After a brawl broke out, Phoenix {{arrived on the scene}} appearing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid only to assist LayCool in attacking James and Maria. McCool hit James with the cake and poured punch over her. LayCool continued to deride James, with Layla dressing up in a fatsuit with a pig mask and losing to McCool in a faux match for the Women's Championship as Piggie James. LayCool's boasting would be their downfall at the Royal Rumble, however, when Layla came out in the Piggie James outfit. James used this to her advantage, when she attacked Layla which distracted McCool allowing her to be pinned in under a minute, losing the Women's Championship. On the February 12 episode of SmackDown, LayCool defeated James in a non-title handicap match made by SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage.|$|E
25|$|Between 1836 and 1840, {{relations}} between Smaïl-aga and the Christian inhabitants of his land had greatly deteriorated. Smaïl-aga's son, Rustem-beg, drank heavily and often raped {{women from the}} Drobnjaci and Pivljani tribes while stopping by their villages to collect tribute. Furious, the Drobnjaci approached Njegoš and asked him for help killing Rustem-beg. Njegoš reasoned that by killing Rustem-beg he would risk infuriating Smaïl-aga, prompting him to seek vengeance against Njegoš, {{as well as the}} Drobnjaci and Pivljani. Instead, he persuaded the tribes to assassinate Smaïl-aga himself, as well as his closest associates, leaving Rustem-beg unprotected and powerless to avenge his father's death. The Drobnjaci heeded Njegoš's advice and organized a plot to have Smaïl-aga killed. In early September 1840, some of the Drobnjaci rebelled and refused to pay tribute to Smaïl-aga's son, instead daring Smaïl-aga <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> villages and collect it himself. Smaïl-aga arranged for a carriage procession to Drobnjaci and set up camp in Mljetičak, a hamlet overlooking the town of Nikšić. On 23 September, he and his delegation were ambushed by a band of 300–400 Drobnjaci warriors led by Novica Cerović, Đoko Malović and Šujo Karadžić. Smaïl-aga attempted to flee but discovered that a spy had hobbled all the horses. He was surrounded in his tent and shot by one of the Drobnjaci warriors; forty other Turks were killed in the ambush. Once Smaïl-aga was dead, the warrior Mirko Aleksić severed his head with an axe. Cerović then took the head to Cetinje and presented it to Njegoš. Satisfied with the outcome of the plot, Njegoš rewarded Cerović by making him a senator.|$|E

In late May 2009, Knowles' label announced through a press release that the singer decided to set aside 2,000 seats for each date on her then-forthcoming North American tour at a discounted price of $20. After already selling 1,000 tickets per show for the special low price, the last 1,000 discounted seats for each show were made available to the public on May 29, 2009 through Ticketmaster (with the exception of the artist's four-night residency at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas). Due to the big demand, Sony Music announced additional dates in England, Asia and South America. In May 2009, Knowles' official website was peppered with requests by disappointed fans — from Boston; Anchorage, Alaska; Tampa, Florida; St. Louis and Montreal — who asked from her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> towns. The Daily Mail reported that the first European {{leg of the}} tour sold over 350,000 tickets for 32 shows; the UK part of the leg sold out completely with Knowles playing to over 100,000 fans. Knowles broke her record of concert attendees by selling out the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil, with over 60,000 tickets sold. It was reported to Billboard that as of September 16, 2009, from the 53 shows, Knowles grossed $53.5 million and drawn 667,509 fans from the mostly 15,000-seat arenas. In 2009, the tour was nominated for Eventful Fans' Choice Award at the 6th Annual Billboard Touring Awards.
