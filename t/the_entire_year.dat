5|$|This {{does not}} mean that a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form outside of an El Niño event. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, but it had one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E

In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues and was used mostly in a long relief role.

5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> beat CBS for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Hennessey {{was drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants {{in the first round}} (21st overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. He began his career with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League, where he had a 10 record, a 2.38 ERA, 22 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in nine starts. That year, Salem-Keizer won the Northwest League championship. While {{pitching}} in an instructional league later that year, Hennessey began experiencing soreness that was initially attributed to a muscle strain but {{turned out to be a}} non-cancerous tumor in his back. He had it removed in February 2002, but it grew back later that season, and he missed <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> while undergoing a second surgery.|$|E

The cargo volume projected for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> was estimated at 345,000tonnes, including 6,170TEUs. The growth was permitted by investments made in late 2007, and the increased volume of operation brought about profit of approximately 2.4million kuna (325,000euro) in {{the first nine months of}} 2008. Overall port operations continue to grow, as 18,000 arrivals were recorded by 2010. Director of the Split Port Authority is Joško Berket Bakota.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{was drafted}} by the Eagles with the 25th {{selection}} {{in the first round}} of the 2001 NFL Draft. He began the 2001 season as the fourth wide receiver, but surpassed Na Brown to become the team's slot receiver in week eight. Mitchell became the fourth receiver again after the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman before the 2002 season and caught only twelve passes <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b> Mitchell became the slot receiver once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with the Eagles facing a 4th and 26 situation, he caught a 28-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to help led the team to a win in overtime.

By genre, it is the ninth-highest grossing musical and the tenth-highest earner among comedy road movies.

5|$|The {{scale of}} Our Friends in the North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b> Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed {{it was because the}} story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of Our Friends in the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|E

It was his tenth career multi-home run game and third of the 2015 season. On July 30, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, Davis hit his 25th home run of the year, which {{happened}} to be his 83rd career home run at Oriole Park, which gave him sole possession of 6th place on the stadium's all-time home run list. On August 5, Davis hit his sixth career grand slam and second of the season in the tenth inning in a game against the Oakland Athletics, which helped lift Baltimore to a 7-3 victory. Ten days later, Davis hit a walk-off solo home run against the A's in Baltimore. It was his second home run of the night and number thirty-four on the year. On September 3, Davis hit a walk off solo home run to help the O's end a six-game losing skid. It was his thirty-eighth of the year. It was also his 152nd with the Orioles, giving him sole possession of eleventh place on the franchise's all-time list. The home run also happened to be his 90th career home run at OPACY, now giving him sole possession of fourth on the stadium's all-time list. On September 4, Davis became the first Orioles player to have back-to-back multi-home run games since 2009. In addition, he became the first Orioles player ever with multiple 40-home-run seasons (hit 53 in 2013). That game, against Toronto, became his sixth multi-homer game of the year and the thirteenth of his career. Davis led the majors in home runs with 47. This made Davis the only Orioles hitter to ever have two seasons with 40+ homers (53 in 2013 & 47 in 2015).|$|E
