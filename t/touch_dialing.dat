50|$|The Dialogic {{cards are}} capable of making and {{answering}} calls, identifying caller ID, playing back sounds to the caller and recording sounds from the line, and detecting Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals (<b>touch</b> tones) <b>dialed</b> by the caller. They can also tear down a call and detect when the caller has hung up.|$|R
50|$|Other {{countries}} {{have sought to}} use technical means to prevent callback, by blocking the inbound and outbound calls made to and from DID numbers, or by disabling <b>touch</b> tone <b>dialing.</b> However, this is also overcome {{by the use of}} speed dial numbers, while others use these services by triggering callback via the Internet or SMS.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{fresh off}} {{a run of}} Bean's first musical, Don't <b>Touch</b> That <b>Dial!</b> at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, Bean was asked to write a new musical for their {{intimate}} black box space, the Stackner Cabaret.Bean suggested a musical about high school song leaders from the '50s and '60s, best friends, singing at prom for their best friends and boyfriends. He would use pop songs from the '50s and '60s to tell story of the characters. In this way, The Marvelous Wonderettes was born in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|DTMF is {{a system}} that is widely used for {{telephone}} signalling and is almost universally used for <b>touch</b> tone <b>dialing</b> for landline telephones today. It uses set pairs of tones that are used to carry the information. The eight frequencies used are 697, 770, 852, 941 Hz which are termed the [...] "low tones" [...] and 1,209; 1,336; 1,477; and 1,633 Hz which are [...] "high tones". One high and one low tone is used together and the various combinations are used to represent different numbers and symbols.|$|R
5000|$|KOME's diamond shaped {{stickers}} were {{a common}} sight on vehicles and high school lockers around the area. Several on-air slogans suggested the sexual connotations of its call letters, probably the most memorable being [...] "Don't <b>touch</b> that <b>dial,</b> it's got [...] "KOME" [...] on it!" [...] {{as well as others}} saying things like [...] "K-O-M-E all over your radio dial," [...] "You've got KOME... oozing out of your speakers," [...] "Wake up with KOME in your ear," [...] and [...] "The KOME spot on your radio dial." [...] Not surprisingly, Playboy magazine found this newsworthy enough to mention the station.|$|R
50|$|A {{braille watch}} is a {{portable}} timepiece {{used by the}} {{blind or visually impaired}} to tell time. It is used by <b>touching</b> the <b>dial</b> and noticing the embossments. Both analog and digital versions are available. The analog versions have a protective glass or crystal cover that is flipped open when time needs to be read and the clock-hands are constructed to not be susceptible to movement at the mere touch of the finger that a blind person uses to observe their positions. In the digital form, the dots (like braille script) keep changing position as time changes. In this case, one must understand the Braille alphabet to read the watch.|$|R
5000|$|The Trimline handset was {{produced}} in both rotary dial and Touch-Tone versions. Rotary dial Trimline production began in late 1965 and <b>Touch</b> Tone <b>dials</b> were added the following year in mid-1966. The Trimline base was available in desk-top and wall-mount versions. The handsets and bases were interchangeable. The Trimline was the first US telephone to achieve some design recognition in Europe, where it {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Manhattan" [...] model or the [...] "Gondola". Today, similarly designed telephones are sold by many companies. AT&T retained the Trimline name for the later [...] "Trimline III", a more compact successor featuring squared corners and straight lines.|$|R
5|$|Control room {{terminals}} {{will have}} new functionality including identification of all users and radio terminal positioning, radio and telephone inquiries {{made on the}} same equipment, use of either loudspeakers or head sets, and allowing operators to listen to each other's conversations. Operators have access to telephone books and speed <b>dials,</b> <b>touch</b> screen operations of voice and data traffic, monitoring of other talk groups, simultaneous calls to several talk groups and access to voice logs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{two studies}} investigating {{the use of}} novel modalities for bimanual vertical scrolling on tablet devices. Several bimanual interaction techniques are presented, {{using a combination of}} physical <b>dial,</b> <b>touch</b> and pressure input, which split the control of scrolling speed and scrolling direction across two hands. The new interaction techniques are compared to equivalent unimanual techniques in a controlled linear targeting task. The results suggest that participants can select targets significantly faster and with a lower subjective workload using the bimanual techniques...|$|R

5000|$|He {{regularly}} fuses traditional Chinese {{instruments and}} styles with R&B or rock {{to form a}} new genre called [...] "Zhongguo feng" [...] (...) , which literally means [...] "Chinese Style Music", some of which are written in the Pentatonic Scale as opposed to the more common seven-note scale (Diatonic scale) to accentuate an oriental style. Besides his own culture, he also incorporated Spanish guitar in [...] "Red Imitation" [...] (...) , American techno/electronica in [...] "Herbalist's Manual" [...] (...) , rap with subtle classical music undertones in [...] "Reverse Scales" [...] (...) , Blues style in [...] "Free Tutorial Video" [...] (...) and Bossanova style in [...] "Rosemary" [...] (...) , to name a few. Sound effects from everyday life are frequently woven into his music, such as bouncing ping pong balls, <b>touch</b> tone phone <b>dialing,</b> helicopter blades, dripping rain, and radio static noise (Musique concrète).|$|R
