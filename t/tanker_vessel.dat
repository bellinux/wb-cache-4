Simon destroys a cofferdam, flooding the tunnel, but McClane escapes through a vent, ending up near Carver.

50|$|Tank {{cars are}} {{another way to}} move crude oil across a landmass. The oil is loaded into the tank cars, and are moved by a diesel train across the rails to the {{refinery}} or the trains planned destination. Trains can carry a mass amount of this oil by using of multiple tank cars. Though each rail car holds a lot less oil than a large marine <b>tanker</b> <b>vessel,</b> when multiple are used a lot of oil can be transported. For example, the DOT-111 tank car is a very common tank car and can hold 34500 gal. If ten tank cars were pulled the train would be carrying 345000 gal of oil, so the amount of volume increases rapidly. The locomotive used to pull these rail cars have a massive amount of horsepower and can be hooked up with other locomotives to increase the horsepower, making the rail car a fairly cost effective way to move this oil. These railcars just like the pipelines {{can be used to}} carry a refined fuel instead of crude oil from a refinery to a distributing plant. Railcars are a common way to move this fuel a long distance to areas where they do not have pipelines set up.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} are {{accident}} vessel damage cost differentials among container, tanker and bulk vessels. Tobit estimates of accident vessel damage cost equations suggest that vessel damage cost differentials exist for container versus bulk and tanker versus bulk vessel accidents, but not for container versus <b>tanker</b> <b>vessel</b> accidents. The vessel damage cost per vessel gross ton of a container (tanker) accident is $ 33. 37 ($ 18. 37) {{less than that of}} a bulk accident, all else held constant.

The accident vessel damage cost differentials found in this paper may be compared with vessel hull insurance rates for investigating whether the latter reflect the former. Also, such comparisons may reveal whether there is cross-subsidisation among vessel hull insurance payees.
