5|$|The four hijackers {{checked in}} for the flight between 07:03 and 07:39Eastern Time. At 07:03, Ghamdi checked in without any luggage while Nami checked in <b>two</b> <b>bags.</b> At 07:24, Haznawi checked in one bag and at 07:39, Jarrah checked in without any luggage. Haznawi was the only hijacker {{selected}} for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). His checked bag underwent extra screening for explosives, with no extra scrutiny required by CAPPS at the passenger-security checkpoint. None of the security checkpoint personnel reported anything unusual about the hijackers.|$|E

His blood was also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist told how marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed told the court he had seen his brother cleaning the murder weapon {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing. Further witnesses reported Nazir admitting to beating someone up, Mahrad admitting to kicking Parker and Awan recalling stabbing him. A witness also saw all four defendants kicking Parker.|$|E
40|$|Seepage meters {{provide a}} useful, {{inexpensive}} method of measuring seepage flux through unconsolidated sediments in lakes, reservoirs, and stream channels. In the literature, the bag type used {{is usually not}} indicated, {{and its effect on}} seepage measurement has not been evaluated. The effects of bag type and seepage meter size have been evaluated in a laboratory setting. A sandbox 100. 4 (L) × 76. 2 (W) × 24 (H) cm size was half filled with coarse sand and water to a depth of 10 cm. Four seepage meters and <b>two</b> <b>bag</b> types (balloon and condom) were used in the seepage measurements.

5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have <b>two</b> <b>bags</b> that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and <b>two</b> <b>bags</b> of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other.

25|$|The bag of {{cannabis}} was not fingerprinted by the Indonesian custom {{officials or}} police, nor analysed {{to determine its}} origin. The cannabis was contained in <b>two</b> <b>bags,</b> and although the outer bag had been handled by customs officers, Corby's defence argued that only {{the bottom of the}} inner bag had been contaminated. Therefore, it was claimed that fingerprinting of the inner bag could be of value to the defence if it was shown not to possess Corby's fingerprints. In spite of requests to have the bag tested, including {{at the time of her}} arrest, such had not occurred by the time of Corby's second court appearance on 3 February 2005. At that court appearance the bag was handled by court officials. A formal request for fingerprinting made after the court appearance was unsuccessful. The prosecution argued that fingerprinting was unnecessary, as Corby was found with the drugs in her possession.|$|E
25|$|Skybus charged extra {{fees for}} almost {{everything}} {{other than the}} ticket itself. This is common among European low-cost carriers, but was almost unheard of at the time among major US carriers. Carry-on baggage (one bag plus one personal item) was free, but checked bags incurred an additional charge. The first <b>two</b> <b>bags</b> less than fifty pounds were $10 each online or $12 each at the counter, with each additional bag after two incurring a charge of $50 per bag. Overweight baggage, those weighing over fifty but under seventy-five pounds, was charged an extra $25, and all bags over seventy-five pounds were not accepted. Skybus did not through-check luggage onto connecting flights. Customers connecting on Skybus flights in Columbus were required to collect any checked luggage, then re-check it in Columbus for the second flight. Even though Skybus did not through-check luggage, delayed luggage was a continuing problem for its outsourced ground crews.|$|E

25|$|Tebow started against Kentucky despite {{suffering}} from a respiratory illness and taking <b>two</b> <b>bags</b> of intravenous fluids before the game. He ran for two touchdowns {{to put him in}} 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown. Late in the third quarter, he was hit in the chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham, fell backwards, and hit {{the back of his head}} on the knee of Florida tackle Marcus Gilbert, who was wearing a hard knee brace. Upon impact, Tebow briefly displayed a prominent fencing response with his left arm, indicating that a concussion had taken place. He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped to the sidelines, where he vomited. He was taken by ambulance to the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center. A CT scan showed no bleeding in the brain, with the injury described as a mild concussion. Coach Urban Meyer stayed the night in the hospital with Tebow, who was discharged in the morning. Coincidentally, Florida did not have a game scheduled for the following Saturday, and Tebow was cleared to play in the Gators' next contest at LSU on October 10, two weeks after the incident.|$|E

The group also claimed that 6,018 votes for the Felicity Party (SP) had been unrecorded. In Muş, violence broke out after several HDP activists alleged that votes had been stolen in the province, with the police firing on the activists with tear gas. The President of the Sakarya Bars Association, Zafer Kazan, claimed on Twitter that <b>two</b> <b>bags</b> of votes had been stolen in Sakarya, with false results being recorded using forged signatures. After their seats in Kocaeli fell from two to one, the MHP demanded a re-count, with some activists claiming that election fraud {{had taken place in}} the province. A stamp, used to vote on ballot papers, was stolen from a polling station in Esenyurt, İstanbul, which could have potentially allowed the culprits to vote more than once on fake ballot papers. In Adıyaman, an individual who was filmed walking out of a polling station with a bag full of votes claimed {{that he was going to}} Mosque, but was violently apprehended by many voters who had arrived on the scene. The police later escorted the individual out of the hostile crowd. The CHP raised concern over the lack of up-to-date voter records, having identified 2,860 non-existent voters on the electoral rall in the İstanbul district of Kadıköy alone.|$|E

500|$|Babb {{was born}} in 1906 in Lees Creek, Ohio, USA (near Wilmington).

Babb held a number of jobs during his youth, gaining a mention in Ripley's Believe It Or Not for refereeing a record number of youth sports games. He started out with jobs in sportswriting and reporting at a local newspaper in his 20s, and even showed signs of his later work while showcasing [...] "Digger" [...] O'Dell, the [...] "living corpse," [...] but first achieved success after his promotion to publicity manager for the Chakeres-Warners movie theaters, where he would create different kinds of stunts to lure audiences—for example, a drawing to award <b>two</b> <b>bags</b> of groceries to one ticket holder at selected theaters. Another gimmick was to find a furniture store window where a bedroom suite was on display, and there Babb would place a large sign reading [...] "Win a bedroom suit (theatre location & date listed)". [...] This always ensured a packed house, and the [...] "lucky" [...] winner was awarded with a pair of pajamas. [...] These experiences led him to the exploitation film business.|$|E
500|$|The game {{combines}} several Aztec {{beliefs of}} the afterlife and underworld with 1930s Art Deco design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the film noir genre. The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafer's decade-long fascination with folklore, stemming from an anthropology class he took at University of California Berkeley, and talks with folklorist Alan Dundes, with Schafer recognizing that the four-year journey of the soul in the afterlife would {{set the stage for}} an adventure game. Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting: [...] "Then I thought, what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? You'd want to be the grim reaper himself. That's how Manny got his job. Then I imagined him picking up people {{in the land of the}} living and bringing them to the land of the dead, like he's really just a glorified limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe, but really, he's just punching the clock." [...] Schafer recounted a Mexican folklore about how the dead were buried with <b>two</b> <b>bags</b> of gold to be used in the afterlife, one on their chest and one hidden in their coffin, such that if the spirits in the afterlife stole the one on the chest, they would still have the hidden bag of gold; this idea of a criminal element in the afterlife led to the idea of a crime-ridden, film noir style to the world, triggered too many ideas that they had to then trim down. The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the game's overall puzzle into four discrete sections. Each year was divided into several non-linear branches of puzzles that all had to be solved before the player could progress to the next year.|$|E

Four babies with positive bag specimens were unfortunately not completely investigated: 2 had mixed growths and 2 had pure growths of 100 000 organisms/ml. As we and others consider that bacteriuria can only be diagnosed on a suprapubic sample of urine the incidence of proved infection in our series was zero. If both the babies with a pure growth of 100 000 organisms/ml had true bacteriuria, the incidence would rise to 1. 3 %. In view of the difficulties in obtaining clean urine samples in preterm babies and as the incidence of bacteriuria is so low, we do not recommend that healthy preterm babies be screened for bacteriuria...|$|R
