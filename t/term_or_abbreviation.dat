30|$|Defining {{the most}} {{appropriate}} hashtag for the search required a pre-analysis of tweets. As Bruns and Stieglitz [5] point out “hashtag research depends crucially {{on the existence of}} a widely adopted hashtag, and on its (early) detection and tracking by researchers”. This is especially true for a thematic field like “non-communicable diseases” where different <b>terms</b> <b>or</b> <b>abbreviations,</b> and therefore alternative hashtags, might be used unlike for example in the case of #smartgrid where the choice of the hashtag term is obvious. To make sure it was searched for the most common hashtag used in the Twitter debate on non-communicable diseases, tweets containing different hashtags (#ncd, #ncds, #noncommunicable, #noncommunicablediseases) were imported over a time period of two months. Based on the number of tweets and a spot check of the content #ncds was identified as the most common hashtag in this context; thus it was decided to focus on this search term.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a text messaging system for processing incoming Short Message Service (SMS) queries, retrieving medical journal citations from MEDLINE/PubMed and sending {{them back to}} the user in the text message format. A database of medical terminology abbreviations and acronyms was developed {{to reduce the size of}} text in journal citations and abstracts because of the 160 -character per message limit of text messages. Queries may be sent as full-length <b>terms</b> <b>or</b> <b>abbreviations.</b> An algorithm transforms the citations into the SMS format. An abbreviated TBL (the bottom-line) summary instead of the full abstract is sent to the mobile device to shorten the resulting text. The system decreases citation size by 77. 5 ± 7. 9 %. Txt 2 MEDLINE provides physicians and healthcare personnel another rapid and convenient method for searching MEDLINE/PubMed through wireless mobile devices. It is accessible from any location worldwide where GSM wireless service is available...|$|R

Comprehension about the meaning of a term can be helped by the presence of dictionary terms. This web-based dictionary is designed to help learners study the medical profession and ordinary people who want to understand the <b>terms</b> <b>or</b> <b>abbreviations</b> used in the medical profession. Existing medical dictionary currently there are only devoted to the <b>term</b> in English <b>or</b> just a long table so that the search process is still less effective. Designing dictionary medical terms it uses the model of UML (United Modeling Language). Line diagrams depicted in use-case diagrams and activity diagrams. Design Dictionary of Terms This web based programming language PHP and MYSQL database. Data were obtained from medical books.

5000|$|In most countries, {{corporate}} names {{include a}} <b>term</b> <b>or</b> an <b>abbreviation</b> that denotes the corporate {{status of the}} entity (for example, [...] "Incorporated" [...] or [...] "Inc." [...] in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, [...] "Limited" [...] or [...] "Ltd."). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions, they are mandatory, and in others they are not. Their use puts everybody on constructive notice that {{they are dealing with}} an entity whose liability is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.|$|R
40|$|Information {{contained}} in the free text of health records is useful for the immediate care of patients {{as well as for}} medical knowledge creation. Advances in clinical language processing have made it possible to automatically extract this information, but most research has, until recently, been conducted on clinical text written in English. In this thesis, however, information extraction from Swedish clinical corpora is explored, particularly focusing on the extraction of clinical findings. Unlike most previous studies, Clinical Finding was divided into the two more granular sub-categories Finding (symptom/result of a medical examination) and Disorder (condition with an underlying pathological process). For detecting clinical findings mentioned in Swedish health record text, a machine learning model, trained on a corpus of manually annotated text, achieved results in line with the obtained inter-annotator agreement figures. The machine learning approach clearly outperformed an approach based on vocabulary mapping, showing that Swedish medical vocabularies are not extensive enough for the purpose of high-quality information extraction from clinical text. A rule and cue vocabulary-based approach was, however, successful for negation and uncertainty classification of detected clinical findings. Methods for facilitating expansion of medical vocabulary resources are particularly important for Swedish and other languages with less extensive vocabulary resources. The possibility of using distributional semantics, in the form of Random indexing, for semi-automatic vocabulary expansion of medical vocabularies was, therefore, evaluated. Distributional semantics does not require that <b>terms</b> <b>or</b> <b>abbreviations</b> are explicitly defined in the text, and it is, thereby, a method suitable for clinical corpora. Random indexing was shown useful for extending vocabularies with medical terms, as well as for extracting medical synonyms and abbreviation dictionaries...|$|R
40|$|During {{a manual}} {{translation}} of short texts, such as texts occurring on social networks or microblogs (e. g., Twitter), translators are often forced to gather additional information from various sources. These can include less common words, domain-specific <b>terms,</b> <b>or</b> numerous <b>abbreviations.</b> The {{aim of this}} thesis is to design and implement a system which automatically creates a minimal context-dependent dictionary for the given short message. The system identifies suitable dictionary entries in the translated text and searches for their definitions, translations, and examples from available open sources, or extracts them automatically from a parallel corpus. The resulted dictionary is ideally sufficient for human translators to understand the message, and to choose appropriate translation equivalent (including technical terms). An empirical evaluation is based on statistics which tracks how often users {{were satisfied with the}} proposed entries, how often the entries were incorrect and to what extent the system correctly identified the relevance for the input text...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{data mining}} and {{business}} intelligence are attracting huge industry interest in recent years. Engineers encounter a bottleneck when applying data mining tools to textual healthcare records. Many medical {{terms in the}} healthcare records {{are different from the}} standard form, which are referred to as informal medical terms in this work. Study indicates that in Chinese healthcare records, a majority of the informal <b>terms</b> are <b>abbreviations</b> <b>or</b> typos. In this work, a multi-field indexing approach is proposed, which accomplishes the term normalization task with information retrieval algorithm with four level indices: word, character, pinyin and its initial. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is advantageous over the state-of-the-art approaches. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014...|$|R
