5000|$|TIM (<b>Transient</b> <b>Intermodulation</b> <b>Distortion)</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Dr. Matti Otala in the 1960s due to accidentally wiring an amplifier incorrectly.|$|E
50|$|Slew-induced {{distortion}} (SID or slew-rate induced distortion) {{is caused}} when an amplifier or transducer {{is required to}} change output (or displacement), i.e. slew rate, faster than {{it is able to}} do so without error. At such times any other signals may suffer considerable gain distortion, leading to intermodulation distortion. <b>Transient</b> <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> may involve some degree of SID and/or distortion due to peak compression.|$|E
5000|$|For {{some years}} {{following}} the introduction of solid state amplifiers, their perceived sound {{did not have the}} excellent audio quality of the best valve amplifiers (see valve audio amplifier). This led audiophiles to believe that [...] "tube sound" [...] or valve sound had an intrinsic quality due to the vacuum tube technology itself. In 1970, Matti Otala published a paper on the origin of a previously unobserved form of distortion: <b>transient</b> <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> (TIM), later also called slew-induced distortion (SID) by others. TIM distortion was found to occur during very rapid increases in amplifier output voltage.|$|E
50|$|In this context, {{distortion}} {{refers to}} any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually clipping, harmonic <b>distortion,</b> or <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> (mixing phenomena) caused by non-linear behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations. Terms for specific types of nonlinear audio distortion include: crossover distortion, slew-Induced <b>Distortion</b> (SID) and <b>transient</b> <b>intermodulation</b> (TIM).|$|R
3000|$|Traditionally, the IMD of {{distorting}} {{systems has}} been measured by feeding a sum of two sinusoids with different frequencies {{into the system}} and plotting the resulting spectrum. Although this type of analysis gives an exact indication of the frequencies and amplitudes of the distortion components for a given pair of input signal frequencies and amplitudes, it is not very useful in determining the overall level of the IMD. It {{should be noted that}} with distorting audio effects, it is often useful to know the exact frequency and amplitude behavior of the harmonic distortion components, since there are some strong opinions regarding the harmonic content and the resulting sound, such as [...] "the vacuum tube sound consists mainly of even harmonics", or that [...] "the 7 th harmonic is something to be avoided". With IMD, however, it is probably more useful to have a single number indicating the overall amount of distortion, since IMD is generally considered an undesired phenomenon, with no specific preferences on any particular IMD components. Furthermore, traditional IMD measurements ignore the dynamic behavior of the intermodulation mechanism, so that dynamic or <b>transient</b> <b>intermodulation</b> (DIM/TIM) [4] <b>distortion</b> components are left unnoticed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} bias and voltage gain {{dependence}} of the small signal <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> performance of the single and double InGaP HBT.

The small signal <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> was little affected by collector voltage or voltage gain.

The amplifier was designed by Finnish engineer Dr. Matti Otala who discovered <b>transient</b> <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> (TIM) in 1970 and worked to mitigate its effects in the following years.

40|$|The {{performance}} and feasibility of switched multibeam array antennas in cellular systems is investigated. We assume that multicarrier power amplifiers (MCPA:s) {{are used in}} the base-station, to co-amplify the transmitted signals. The MCPA generates <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> and it is shown how the multibeam antenna makes the radiated <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> dependent on the azimuthal lookdirection. Given the carrier to <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> ratio of the MCPA, semi-analytical expression for the outage probability for the mobiles is derived assuming a lognormal fading radio channel.

40|$|The {{performance}} of switched multibeam antennas for cellular radio systems is investigated when the transmit amplifier is of a multicarrier (MCPA) type. The MCPA nonlinearity generates <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> in the transmitted signal that is spatially filtered by the array radiation pattern. Hence, the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> becomes direction-dependent, {{and the direction}} of the generated intermodulation products of any order is derived. It is shown by using Monte Carlo simulations how the downlink carrier to interference ratio depends on the frequency reuse distance and on the MCPA linearity measured as its noise power ratio (NPR). For reuse factor one systems, which is made possible by use of multibeam antennas, the linear co-channel interference dominates the interference. On the contrary, for a reuse factor seven system it is shown that a weak nonlinearity directly gives a degradation in carrier to interference ratio (CIR) due to <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion.</b> However the reuse [...] ...|$|R
