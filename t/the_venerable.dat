5|$|Hoping to {{establish}} his credentials {{once and for all}} as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work Life-Histories of Northern Animals, which was published in 1909.

50|$|In 1840, the {{hospital}} became a textile factory {{and the former}} residents were moved to the Charity Hospital.

5|$|As {{the road}} {{condition}} required extremely good driving skills, the China Relief Fund decided to test drivers {{and established a}} driving institute on a vacant piece of accessible land behind the Siong Lim Temple. Venerable Pu Liang, the monastery's 10th abbot, supported the China Relief Fund. Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form a batch. In 1939, about 3,200volunteers left in nine batches that included not only Chinese men, but also Indians, Malays, and four Chinese women. About 1,000 of them died in service, 1,000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war. <b>The</b> <b>Venerable</b> {{and two of his}} disciples were later arrested and executed during the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH.

The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used <b>the</b> <b>venerable</b> Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism.

Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E

5|$|The third error {{enumerated}} by Peter <b>the</b> <b>Venerable</b> {{was that}} the Petrobrusians “command the sacred crosses to be broken in pieces and burned, because that form or instrument by which Christ was so dreadfully tortured, so cruelly slain, is not worthy of any adoration, or veneration or supplication, but for the avenging of his torments and death it should be treated with unseemly dishonor, cut in pieces with swords, burnt in fire.” This {{was seen as an}} iconoclastic heresy and as acts of sacrilege by the medieval Church, as well as by Catholics to this day.|$|E
5|$|Downes was {{chairman}} of the Masseurs' Registration Board, a councillor of the Victorian division of the Australian Red Cross, and chairman of the Red Cross National Council. He was Victorian State Commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade for 25 years. He was also president of the St John Ambulance Association for eight years, and chairman of the Victorian Civil Ambulance Service from 1937 to 1938. In 1930, he was appointed a Commander of <b>the</b> <b>Venerable</b> Order of Saint John, and later became a Knight of Grace of the order in 1937. At the same time, Doris became an Officer of the Order of Saint John, in recognition for her fund raising efforts for the Victorian branch. She also later served as a member of its council from 1942 to 1953. Downes was instrumental in persuading the various state branches to come together as a national organisation, arguing that without a national body, the organisation would be eclipsed by the Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|In 1127 Theobald {{was made}} prior of Bec, after Boso succeeded William as abbot. Theobald became abbot in 1137, {{following}} Boso's death in June 1136. The monks of Bec unanimously elected {{him to be}} their new abbot without first consulting the Archbishop of Rouen, Hugh de Boves, who consequently threatened to void the result. Audoen, the Bishop of Evreux, and brother of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, intervened with Hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election. Another problem then arose when Hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from Theobald, which Theobald refused to provide; no previous abbot had made such a profession. Theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of Peter <b>the</b> <b>Venerable,</b> Abbot of Cluny, allowing Theobald to give a verbal profession to Hugh.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} career Ninnis served both on ships and in hospitals. He {{received}} Sir Gilbert Blane's Gold Medal in 1879, {{was promoted to}} Deputy Inspector-General in 1883, was appointed Principal Medical Officer at Melville Naval Hospital in 1892, and was selected as a Knight of Grace of <b>the</b> <b>Venerable</b> Order of Saint John in 1895. Upon his retirement in 1897 {{he was promoted to}} Inspector-General, and in 1900 and 1902 served as President of the Section of the Navy, Army, and Ambulance of the British Medical Association. He was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1912. Ninnis was initiated into the Freemasons 1872, was a founder of several Lodges, and in 1901 became a Past Grand Deacon of England. He was the father of Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, an explorer who was lost down a crevasse during the 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>venerable</b> dreadnoughts of South America soldiered {{on for a}} {{short time}} after the war. The US Navy's All Hands {{magazine}} reported in a series of 1948 articles that all save São Paulo and Almirante Latorre were still in active service; the former had been decommissioned and the latter undergoing repairs. With the influx of the modern cruisers, frigates, and corvettes, the battleships were quickly sold for scrap. The Brazilian Navy was the first to dispose of its dreadnoughts, the oldest in the world by that time. São Paulo was sold for scrap in 1951 but sank in a storm north of the Azores while under tow. Minas Geraes followed two years later and was broken up in Genoa beginning in 1954. Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, Moreno was towed to Japan for scrapping in 1957, and Rivadavia was broken up in Italy beginning in 1959. Almirante Latorre, inactive and unrepaired after a 1951 explosion in its engine room, was decommissioned in October 1958 and followed Moreno to Japan in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Despite Harry's {{aunt and}} uncle's desperate {{prevention}} of Harry gleaning about his powers, their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, {{who is also}} his first contact with the Wizarding World. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts {{as well as some}} of Harry's history. Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who subsequently attempted to kill him as well. Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the Wizarding World. However, at the orders of <b>the</b> <b>venerable</b> and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and torturing him like he is their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.|$|E
