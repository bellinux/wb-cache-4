5|$|A {{state of}} {{calamity}} was declared in nine provinces. In response, the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), {{in conjunction with}} local governments, provided ₱15.5million ($333,000 USD) toward relief funds. Various agencies, including the NDRM and the Philippine Red Cross, distributed water, meals, medicine, and blankets to affected families. The provincial government of Ilocos Norte provided seeds <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> whose crops were damaged during the storm. The Government Service Insurance System provided ₱197million (US$4million) to pension fund holders in Abra province.|$|E
5|$|After the Philippines fell to Japanese {{forces in}} 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued <b>to</b> <b>farmers.</b> Without {{any change in}} the Marihuana Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports of addiction, madness, and overt sexuality.|$|E

He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931.

5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder causes {{significant economic}} losses because many agricultural crops (although no staple foods) worldwide are pollinated by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{the worth of}} global crops with honey bee pollination was estimated at close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the US have increased the cost <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> renting them for pollination services by up to 20%.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} <b>to</b> <b>farmers.</b> This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E

5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide.

Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E

5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated a surplus of $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid <b>to</b> <b>farmers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> and ranchers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{quantify}} preferences of Danish dairy farmers for breeding goal traits and associations to herd characteristics and production system (organic versus conventional farming).

50|$|The Indian {{government}} {{realized that}} it needed to do many things to win the cooperation of Indian <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> make the green revolution successful.

Then, they had <b>to</b> assure <b>farmers</b> that increased production would not drive down prices as bumper harvests had done in the past. The government had to ensure a supply of quality seeds, fertilizers, and provide adequate storage space.

5|$|Roads in Saint Elizabeth {{sustained}} substantial damage, with 32 separate roads experiencing severe impacts. Throughout the country, a {{total of}} $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) was provided to repair the roads, $4.23million (JMD; US$48,000) of which was used in Saint Elizabeth alone. Widespread damage to crops also resulted in an increased price in store costs. The loss <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> was untimely as it followed a three-month drought that was preceded by damaging hailstorms that ruined crops. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed, mainly in Saint Elizabeth Parish following reports of flooding.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss <b>to</b> <b>farmers</b> because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
