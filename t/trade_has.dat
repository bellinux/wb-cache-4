5|$|A {{consistent}} {{shift from}} land based trade to sea based <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> been recorded {{since the last}} three millennia. The strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many: they are both less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages. Oceanic ports can help forge trading relationships with {{other parts of the}} world easily.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{are raised}} {{throughout}} the country. Fishing employs 5,000 people and provides over 100,000 tons of seafood each year. Bushmeat, long a staple food for rural Cameroonians, is today a delicacy in the country's urban centres. The commercial bushmeat <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> now surpassed deforestation {{as the main}} threat to wildlife in Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|Sea turtles are {{protected}} by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common. Locals take eggs, which {{are believed to be}} an aphrodisiac, and sell them on the black market. The egg <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> been linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Environmentalists working in Lim√≥n say they are often threatened for trying to protect turtle eggs. Jairo Mora was one such environmentalist working in the area.|$|E

5|$|As the {{historic}} capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is centrally {{located in the}} homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 {{percent of the population}} and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture and <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas. Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their tanindrazana (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.|$|E

As of April 21, 2017, Skin <b>Trade</b> <b>has</b> grossed $1.94 million in domestic home video sales.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2017, Miller {{was taken}} out of the game after being {{diagnosed}} with an apparent elbow injury. The next day, on April 24, Miller was put on the 10-day disabled list. After MRI tests, it was revealed that Miller's right elbow was diagnosed with a strained flexor strain and a partially torn UCL. On April 29, Miller announced that he would have Tommy John surgery, therefore ending his 2017 season. He officially underwent the surgery on May 10. Miller started four games, with a 2-2 record and 4.09 ERA in 22 innings. Due to Swanson's top prospect status, Inciarte's All-Star nod, Miller's extremely underwhelming 2016 season and Miller's season-ending injury in 2017, the <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> been panned as one of the worst in recent memory.|$|E
5000|$|High-frequency <b>trading</b> <b>has</b> {{been the}} subject of intense public focus and debate since the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively high productivity, {{which would make}} its population more resilient to fishing pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market. The extent of this <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> not yet been quantified. Another potential threat is habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|The village {{provides}} {{a variety of}} shops and amenities for both local residents and visitors. These are largely situated in West Street and the high street. The village has numerous restaurants and three pubs with considerable trade being brought by tourists visiting the heritage sites and particularly the castle which attracted approximately 150,000 visitors in 2014. Although {{there is still some}} agriculture, the previous reliance on the wool <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> been replaced by service industries catering to the visitors. Both day-trippers and those staying for longer periods are catered for with shops, pubs, cafes and hotels. 52.6% of people within the parish are employed which is slightly lower than the 61.9% in England and Wales and the 65.2% in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter Trade Association (BATS) in 1993. The association handles the cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but in recent years has focussed on timber industry. Other than timber, since British rule ended exports have traditionally been spices, cocoa and tobacco. Birds' nests are harvested at Baturong, Sengarung, Tepadung and Madai Caves by the Ida'an community. Tawau {{is one of the top}} cocoa producers in Malaysia, and the world together with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. The town is the cocoa capital for both in Sabah and Malaysia. Cocoa production is mostly concentrated in the interior, north of the town, while palm oil production is concentrated along the roads to Merotai, Brantian, Semporna and Kunak. Both cocoa and palm oil are part of the large agriculture sector that has become the main income producer for the town.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E
5|$|Water-borne <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> been practiced {{since at}} least the dawn of civilization, when Sumeria was {{connected}} to Harappan India. Around 2000 BC, the Minoans of Crete established the earliest thalassocracy, a maritime empire heavily dependent upon its trade and naval power. The city-states of the Phoenicians and Greeks then replaced them in the centuries after 1200 BC, ultimately establishing far-flung colonial empires which spread from the Sea of Azov to the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Under the Romans, commerce continued to thrive. In the first centuries BC, steppe nomads' interruption of India's access to Siberian gold caused them to open up maritime routes to Malaysia and Indonesia, exposing them first to Hindu and then Muslim traders. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish elsewhere. The Tamil Chola dynasty thrived on trade between Tang China, the Javanese Srivijaya Empire, and the Abbasid Caliphate in the west. Following further conquests, Arabians came to dominate maritime trade in the Indian Ocean, spreading Islam along the East African coast and, eventually, Southeast Asia. A major effect of the Age of Discovery was the unification of the world's regional trade networks into a single world market, largely run by and for the European monarchs and the merchants of Amsterdam, London, and other Atlantic ports. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13 million people were shipped across the Atlantic to be sold as slaves in the Americas. The Hales Trophy was an award for the fastest commercial crossing of the Atlantic and was won by the SS United States in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours, and forty minutes.|$|E

25|$|Chinese world <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> grown rapidly {{over the}} last decades. Total trade was roughly $100 US billion in 1990, 500 billion in 2000, 850 billion in 2004, 1400 billion in 2005, and 2200 billion in 2007. That computes to an over 20-fold {{increase}} in under 20 years and an annualized growth rate of nearly 18%. More remarkably, {{the vast majority of}} China's growth has taken place in the past decade; in other words, not only is the size of China's trade growing, the rate of the growth is accelerating. Thanks to the decades-old Chinese diaspora, the economic dynamism of PRC embassies, China's low-cost manufacturing industry, an efficient export engine, and an exchange rate that until 2010 has been held deliberately low, China's global <b>trade</b> <b>has</b> thrived.|$|E
