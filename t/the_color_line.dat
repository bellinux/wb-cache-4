For the summer routes of 1999, Color Air {{operated}} four daily round trips to Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and five daily round trips to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. In addition, {{there was a}} single daily round trip to London Stansted Airport, and a weekly round trip to Alicante Airport.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Landis's commissionership is the question of race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis's commissionership; Rickey (then running the Brooklyn Dodgers) broke <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>line</b> by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis's death; Robinson became the first black in the major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>line</b> because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E

Liston angrily responded by {{questioning}} whether Dempsey's failure to serve in World War I qualified him to moralize.

25|$|Senators management, {{seemingly}} {{uneasy about}} racial matters, were latecomers to integrating their team, hiring their first black player {{in late summer}} of 1954. The segregationist policy of the Redskins was more overt and controversial. In October 1957, a group of blacks picketed multiple times in front of Griffith Stadium, protesting the lack of black players on the Redskins. It would be five more years before the Redskins finally began employing black players, the last NFL team to erase <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March 1945, {{the white}} majors created the Major League Committee on Baseball Integration. Its members {{included}} Joseph P. Rainey, Larry MacPhail and Branch Rickey. Because MacPhail, {{who was an}} outspoken critic of integration, kept stalling, the committee never met. Under the guise of starting an all-black league, Rickey sent scouts all around the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico, looking for the perfect candidate to break <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>line.</b> His list eventually was narrowed down to three, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe and Jackie Robinson.|$|E

40|$|Data sets {{often include}} {{information}} that can be represented as a mapping that describes how a dependent variable depends on an independent variable. Such a mapping, usually represented as a function graph, can be parameterized to provide a family of function graphs. The challenge is how to efficiently aggregate individual function graph views to represent the whole family and allow visual analysis and search for patterns. We propose a novel view, called <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>lines</b> view, which provides a two dimensional, rectangular view where each line represents a single function graph. The points on the line correspond to values of the independent variable. <b>The</b> point <b>colors</b> represent <b>the</b> value of the dependent variable. The lines, placed next to each other in parallel, show a family of function graphs. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>lines</b> view offers sorting and brushing features which support visual analysis procedures that are difficult to perform with previously existing views...|$|R

Many other top white singers followed suit, including Tony Bennett and Rosemary Clooney, but Cole's show still could not get enough sponsors to continue.|$|E
25|$|The textile industry, once {{concentrated}} in New England with outposts in New Jersey and Philadelphia, had started moving South in the 1880s. By 1933 Southern mills {{produced more than}} seventy percent of cotton and woolen textiles in more modern mills, drawing on the pool of dispossessed farmers and laborers {{willing to work for}} roughly forty percent less than their Northern counterparts. As was the rest of economic life, the textile industry was strictly segregated and drew only from white workers in the Piedmont. Until 1965, when passage of the Civil Rights Act broke <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>line</b> in hiring, less than 2% of textile workers were African American.|$|E

[...] Author Daniel M. Daniel offered Oana's promotion to the Phillies as evidence that, [...] "while baseball is as American as America itself, it is also as cosmopolitan as our national population." [...] Daniel wrote that, without going into the justice of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>line</b> in baseball [...] "is adhered to most strictly." [...] Daniel wrote that, despite Oana's batting record, San Francisco owner Charlie Graham had difficulty selling Oana to a major league club, as some suggested that a full-blooded [...] "Kanaka" [...] may [...] "not be welcome {{in the ranks of}} the big leagues." [...] When the Seals signed Oana, he was rated as [...] "an 'important money' prospect" [...] who would likely draw five figures in a sale to a big league club.|$|E

[...] "To do this, I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within my party and the country."
