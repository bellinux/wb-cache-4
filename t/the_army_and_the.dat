5|$|Bush became {{dissatisfied}} with Colonel Marshall's failure {{to get the}} project moving forward expeditiously, specifically the failure to acquire the Tennessee site, the low priority allocated to the project by <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> location of his headquarters in New York City. Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. He wanted the project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Hitler had {{appointed}} Himmler as Minister of the Interior and Plenipotentiary General for Administration (Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung). In August 1944 Hitler authorised him {{to restructure}} the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, <b>the</b> <b>army,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police services. As head of the Reserve Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war.

5|$|In 1845 King's {{established}} a Military Department to train officers for <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British East India Company, and in 1846 a Theological Department to train Anglican priests. In 1855, King's pioneered evening classes in London; that King's granted {{students at the}} evening classes certificates of college attendance {{to enable them to}} sit University of London degree exams was cited {{as an example of the}} worthlessness of these certificates in the decision by the University of London to end the affiliated colleges system in 1858 and open their examinations to everyone.|$|E
5|$|In {{that year}} he rebelled against Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518), whose fiscal {{stringency}} {{and promotion of}} Miaphysitism were widely unpopular, and allowed Vitalian to quickly win over large parts of <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people of Thrace to his cause. After scoring a series of victories over loyalist armies, Vitalian came to threaten Constantinople itself, and forced Anastasius to officially recant his adoption of Miaphysitism in summer 515. Soon after, however, as Anastasius failed to honour some {{of the terms of}} the agreement, Vitalian marched on Constantinople, only to be decisively defeated by Anastasius' admiral, Marinus.|$|E

5|$|To Sukarno, {{this sort}} of {{operation}} {{had a number of}} merits. Starting a military operation against 'imperialists' would help to bind together the antagonistic forces of <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party (PKI) in supporting him, while not creating a fully escalated conflagration would prevent the militarily superior British and their Commonwealth allies from using their full force. Indonesia had also pulled off a successful operation using similar techniques in the West Irian campaign against the Dutch a decade previous, a raiding campaign into Western New Guinea had ended with the Dutch ceding that territory to prevent Indonesia from 'falling' to Communism.|$|E

5|$|Under Articles102 and 148 of the Constitution, the Brazilian Armed Forces were {{subordinate}} to the Emperor as Commander-in-Chief.

Then, in spring 776, a conspiracy headed by Nikephoros and involving a number of middle-ranking courtiers was discovered. Nikephoros himself was stripped of his rank, but otherwise not harmed, while the other plotters were tonsured as monks and exiled to Cherson in the Crimea.|$|E

5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Radford was a {{principal}} opponent {{to a plan}} to merge the uniformed services. A plan existed to split <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Army Air Forces into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one Cabinet-level defense organization. Fearing {{the loss of their}} branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the National Security Act of 1947, a political victory for the Navy because it created the U.S. Air Force while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, U.S. Department of Defense with limited power and with the Navy maintaining control of its air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the Second Task Fleet, a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.|$|E
5|$|After their marriage, Prince Andrew {{continued}} {{his career in}} the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908, she visited Russia for the wedding of Grand Duchess Marie of Russia and Prince William of Sweden. While there, she talked with her aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order of nurses. Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt's new church. Later in the year, the Grand Duchess began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a more spiritual life. On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, as the Athens government had refused to support the Cretan parliament, which had called for the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League that eventually led to Prince Andrew's resignation from <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.|$|E
