The carrier contributed three Zeros to the total of 11 assigned to the initial combat air patrol over the four carriers.

5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the opening phases of the East Timor {{operation}} began in 1999, the issue regarding the purpose of the Army Reserve still had not been resolved. Instead of being able to provide formed units <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> Regular Army, the Reserves was reduced to providing individuals for round-out purposes only. As a result, in the initial phase of the operation there were only 100 Reservists available to fill positions in INTERFET, mostly in specialist roles that the Regular Army had trouble providing. As the deployment progressed to a second rotation in April 2000, however, a further 630 Reservists volunteered for full-time service.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{suffering}} {{shortages of}} pilots and equipment, No.84 Wing was generally {{able to keep}} pace with the army's requirements. A detachment of No.36 Squadron, flying C-47 Dakotas, was employed <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> wing's supply capabilities. Up until the end of June 1945, No.5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 sorties and No.17 AOP Flight over 1,300, while No.10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No.36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between them. As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased, demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened, and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No.17 AOP Flight.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three months the siege {{continued}} with little significant activity on either side, until the arrival at the end of July of General François Watrin with 5,000 additional men and instructions from General Joachim Murat to prosecute the siege more vigorously. However, the arrival off Porto Ferrajo on 1 August of a powerful British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren in HMS Renown, whose ship chased Bravoure and Succès as far as Leghorn and reopened the sea passage into the port, almost immediately frustrated Watrin's ambitions. At the same time, a small British force under Captain Gordon landed at Porto Ferrajo <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> Tuscan garrison.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water {{collected}} is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system. Various efforts made <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E

5|$|On 17 January 1920, Prohibition {{was instituted}} by {{law in the}} United States. Soon, the {{smuggling}} of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply {{did not have the}} ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission. Tucker was activated and acquired by the Coast Guard on 25 March 1926, as part of a second group of five <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> original twenty.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Army {{had retreated}} from Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced. They {{spent the summer}} of 1776 fortifying those forts, and {{building}} additional ships <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> small American fleet already on the lake. General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fort Saint-Jean, but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake. The Americans, during their retreat, had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake. By early October, the British fleet, which significantly outgunned the American fleet, was ready for launch.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} {{attempted to}} reach out to new audiences by distancing Lords of Shadow from previous Castlevania games, but kept some elements intact to not alienate franchise fans. For example, vampires and werewolves are recurring enemies in the game, but other existing enemies include trolls, giant spiders and goblin-like creatures. The enemies can be defeated for experience points, which can be used to purchase combos or <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> player's abilities further. Lords of Shadow has large-scale bosses known as titans. The Combat Cross can be used to grapple onto their bodies and navigate them, and break the runes that animate the titan.|$|E
5|$|The few {{aircraft}} on the Japanese flight decks at {{the time}} of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of Sōryū, fighters being spotted <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> Combat Air Patrol. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down. Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers to ditch their bombs and attempt to dogfight intercepting F4Fs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first game}} played at Anfield {{after the war}} was against Middlesbrough, on 4 September 1946, which Liverpool lost 1–0 before a crowd of 34,140. Despite this defeat, Liverpool {{finished}} the 1946–47 season as League champions captained again by a Scot, Willie Fagan. Vital to this success were their attacking players; after a 5–0 defeat to Manchester United the club bought Albert Stubbins from Newcastle United, <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> attack alongside Jack Balmer and Billy Liddell. Stubbins and Balmer joined top scpred with 24 league goals and Balmer scoring hat-tricks in three successive matches.|$|E

5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the number}} of {{artillery}} tubes within South Vietnam increased to 430, including new 122mm and 130mm guns, while armored forces were estimated to have increased to 655 tanks and armored personnel carriers, including the new Soviet-built BTR-152. By the end of 1974, the North Vietnamese General Staff had created two army corps headquarters, matching South Vietnam's command and control structure in the I and II Corps Tactical Zones. Most independent North Vietnamese infantry regiments in the south were also combined into divisional structures. A U.S. Defense Attaché Office (established in 1973 to replace MACV, the 50 officers and men of the DAO coordinated all military assistance to South Vietnam) report concluded that the PAVN had increased their strategic reserve from two divisions to seven, making 70,000 additional troops available <b>to</b> <b>augment</b> <b>the</b> 200,000 combat and 100,000 support troops already in South Vietnam.|$|E
