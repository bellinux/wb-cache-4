5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> in NFIB v. Sebelius {{that this}} {{provision}} of the ACA was coercive, and {{that the federal government}} must allow states to continue at pre-ACA levels of funding and eligibility if they chose.|$|E
5|$|In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius {{decided on}} June 28, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> that the {{individual}} mandate was constitutional when the associated penalties were construed as a tax.

5|$|Enforcement {{of federal}} civil rights law in the South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. <b>The</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> in Clyatt v. United States (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court has {{determined}} that the First Amendment also protects citizens from being compelled to say or pay for certain speech. For example, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> that school children could not be punished for refusing either to say {{the pledge of allegiance}} or salute the American flag.|$|E

After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.|$|E
5|$|In Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> {{that where}} a {{shareholder}} receives a dividend representing earnings of a corporation realized by the corporation prior to January 1, 1913, the dividend is not includible in the gross {{income of the}} shareholder for purposes of the Federal Income Tax Act of 1913, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 114 (Oct. 3, 1913). No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations {{between him and his}} aides. The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment. On July 24, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E

5|$|After {{judicial}} {{enforcement of}} the Fifteenth Amendment ended grandfather clauses, white primaries, and other discriminatory tactics, Southern black voter registration gradually increased, rising from five percent in 1940 to twenty-eight percent in 1960. Although the Fifteenth Amendment was never interpreted to prohibit poll taxes, in 1962 the Twenty-fourth Amendment was adopted banning poll taxes in federal elections, and in 1966 <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966) that state poll taxes violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.|$|E
5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, and <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its effect by an act of Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> in Reynolds v. Sims {{that state}} {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned {{on the principle}} of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E

5000|$|The {{proceedings}} of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> are conducted in English only. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>Rules,</b> 1966 are framed under Article 145 of the Constitution {{to regulate the}} practice and procedure of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> same is amended and presently governed by <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>Rules,</b> 2013.(http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/Supreme%20Court%20Rules,%202013.pdf) ...|$|R

5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another area that was {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering v. Board of Education (1968), the Court first articulated the right of {{public employees}} {{to be protected from}} dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E
5|$|The Free Press Clause protects {{publication}} of information and opinions, and applies {{to a wide variety}} of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and New York Times v. United States (1971), <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint—pre-publication censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, the slumbering Fourth Estate awakens to {{make its}} first and final stand. The New York Times sues Googlezon, [...] "claiming the fact-stripping robots are a {{violation}} of copyright law", but <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>rules</b> in favor of Googlezon.|$|R
5|$|Where society's need is great, {{no other}} {{effective}} means of meeting the need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal, certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte (1976), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints. In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz (1990), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints. In Illinois v. Lidster (2004), the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints. However, in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond (2000), <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> that discretionary checkpoints or general crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed.|$|E
5|$|As {{professional}} football {{became a national}} television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, {{but by and large}} the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.|$|E
5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into {{opposition to the}} teaching of evolution, with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting {{to the teaching of}} evolution in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> in Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E
5000|$|In City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, , <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> {{that police}} checkpoints {{set up for}} the purpose of [...] "general crime control" [...] were {{unreasonable}} under the Fourth Amendment. Although <b>the</b> Illinois <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> that Edmond required the trial court to suppress the evidence of Lidster's stop, the Court disagreed.|$|R
25|$|June 28, 2004: In a 5-4 decision, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>rules</b> that Padilla {{should have}} filed his appeal {{in federal court}} in Charleston, S.C., because he is being held at a Navy brig there, rather than in New York, and remands the case to that {{district}} court.|$|R
