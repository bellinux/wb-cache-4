Adams' training was purely <b>technical,</b> <b>teaching</b> Austin the moves, but nothing relating to kayfabe (still somewhat a guarded secret at the time) or business. His first lesson in that came from Tony Falk, the referee in his 1989 televised WCCW debut against Frogman LeBlanc, who called the spots to lead him to a pinfall and a $40 payday.|$|E

25|$|In education, the Brandt Administration {{sought to}} widen {{educational}} opportunities for all West Germans. The government presided over {{an increase in the}} number of teachers, generous public stipends were introduced for students to cover their living costs, and West German universities were converted from elite schools into mass institutions. The school leaving age was raised to 16, and spending on research and education was increased by nearly 300% between 1970 and 1974. Working through a planning committee set up for the “joint task” of university development, the Federal Government started to make investment costs in 1971. Fees for higher or further education were abolished, while a considerable increase in the number of higher education institutions took place. A much needed school and college construction program was carried out, together with the introduction of postgraduate support for highly qualified graduates, providing them with the opportunity to earn their doctorates or undertake research studies. A law on individual promotion of vocational training came into force in October 1971, which provided for financial grants for attendance at further general or <b>technical</b> <b>teaching</b> establishments from the second year of studies at higher technical schools, academies and higher education establishments, training centres of second degree, or certain courses of television teaching. Grants were also made in certain cases for attendance at training centres located outside the Federal Republic.|$|E

6000|$|... 288. And all {{the higher}} {{branches}} of <b>technical</b> <b>teaching</b> are vain without this; nay {{are in some}} sort vain altogether, for they are superseded by this. You may teach imitation, because the meanest man can imitate; but you can neither teach idealism nor composition, because only a great man can choose, conceive, or compose; and he does all these necessarily, and because of his nature. His greatness is in his choice of things, {{in his analysis of}} them, and his combining powers involve the totality of his knowledge in life. His methods of observation and abstraction are essential habits of his thought, conditions of his being. If he looks at a human form he recognizes the signs of nobility in it, and loves them--hates whatever is diseased, frightful, sinful, or designant of decay. All ugliness, and abortion, and fading away; all signs of vice and foulness, he turns away from, as inherently diabolic and horrible; all signs of unconquered emotion he regrets, as weaknesses. He looks only for the calm purity of the human creature, in living conquests of its passions and of fate. That is idealism; but you cannot teach anyone else that preference. Take a man who likes to see and paint the gambler's rage; the hedge-ruffian's enjoyment; the debauched soldier's strife; the vicious woman's degradation;--take a man fed on the dusty picturesque of rags and guilt; talk to him of principles of beauty! make him draw what you will, how you will, he will leave the stain of himself on whatever he touches. You had better go lecture to a snail, and tell it to leave no slime behind it. Try to make a mean man compose; you will find nothing in his thoughts consecutive or proportioned--nothing consistent in his sight--nothing in his fancy. He cannot comprehend two things in relation at once--how much less twenty! How much less all! Everything is uppermost with him in its turn, and each as large as the rest; but Titian or Veronese compose as tranquilly as they would speak--inevitably. The thing comes to them so--they see it so--rightly, and in harmony: they will not talk to you of composition, hardly even understanding how lower people see things otherwise, but knowing that if they do see otherwise, there is for them the end there, talk as you will.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study looks at <b>teaching</b> <b>technical</b> vocabulary in Saudi Arabian industrial colleges as a problematic issue. Both {{the teachers of}} ESP and specialized courses are unaware of their role when they <b>teach</b> <b>technical</b> words to their students which in turns make investigating the instructional overlap comes {{at the heart of}} this study. Many SLA researchers, applied linguists and experienced teachers in the field argue that it is not the job of ESP teachers to embark on "TV direct teaching " i. e. teaching TV meaning(s) and leave this task instead to the specialists in the field. Yet, the actual classroom practice of ESP and specialized teachers reveals clearly how far both types of practitioners are from such argument. However, because technical terminology is made up of low frequency words, applicable only for a specific field of knowledge, this deters researchers from exploring the topic and leaves the field with a noticeable gap in the literature. I can say that this study will be the first of its kind in the Saudi ESP educational domain. Among the main issues which will questioned are; how do ESP and content area practitioners in Saudi industrial colleges approach <b>teaching</b> <b>technical</b> vocabulary, who is really <b>teaching</b> <b>technical</b> words Do their beliefs match their practices, Do they overlap when they <b>teach</b> <b>technical</b> words and do they look at <b>teaching</b> <b>technical</b> words as a problem in their teaching context...|$|R
