John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout praised the song as [...] "possibly the album's strongest offering" [...] and said that its message is one [...] "most everyone can gravitate towards". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today commented that [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] sets up <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> Moment, which he defined as [...] "enjoying the God-given time we're blessed with". Deborah Evans Price of CCM Magazine regarded the song as a [...] "meaningful anthem" [...] and stated that it would [...] "take its place alongside [...] Chapman classics such as 'For the Sake of the Call' and 'The Great Adventure'".|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics in {{the album}} range from band member's {{frustration}} with each other, themselves, and loved ones, {{as well as}} more politically themed songs—a rarity in Ramones music. [...] "My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)" [...] saw the Ramones criticizing US President Ronald Reagan for his actions in Bitburg, Germany regarding World War II; Johnny however, did not agree with <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> song and refused to play it live. Critically, Animal Boy was not nearly as acclaimed as its predecessor, Too Tough to Die, receiving generally mixed reviews, where it was often pointed out that the band had strayed far from their original style and were exploring several genres by this point. It also charted in four different countries, including the United States and United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Also in November 2006, Billboard {{magazine}} was {{curious as to}} why the artist is credited as just his first name, [...] "Yusuf" [...] rather than [...] "Yusuf Islam". His response was [...] "Because 'Islam' doesn't have to be sloganised. The second name is like the official tag, but you call a friend by their first name. It's more intimate, and to me that's <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> record." [...] As for why the album sleeve says [...] "the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens", he responded, [...] "That's the tag with which most people are familiar; for recognition purposes I'm not averse to that. For a lot of people, it reminds them of something they want to hold on to. That name is part of my history {{and a lot of the}} things I dreamt about as Cat Stevens have come true as Yusuf Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fathers of the Church dwell {{constantly}} on the symbolism of this hour. Noon is the hour {{when the sun is}} at its full, it is the image of Divine splendour, the plenitude of God, the time of grace; at the sixth hour Abraham received the three angels. We should pray at noon, says St. Ambrose, because that is the time when the Divine light is in its fulness. Origen, St. Augustine, and several others regard this hour as favourable to prayer. Lastly and above all, it was the hour when Christ was nailed to the Cross; this memory excelling all the others left a still visible trace in most of the liturgy of this hour. This scene from Good Friday is the background for Sext. [...] "Lead us not into temptation" [...] is <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hour. It is also a time to ask God to grant one health and peace of heart, as in the traditional hymn Rector Potens.|$|E
6000|$|The reader should grasp {{clearly the}} date at which {{this book was}} written. It was done in 1907: it {{appeared}} in various magazines as a serial in 1908 and {{it was published in}} the Fall of that year. At that time the aeroplane was, for most people, merely a rumour and the [...] "Sausage" [...] held the air. The contemporary reader has all the advantage of ten years' experience since this story was imagined. He can correct his author at a dozen points and estimate the value of these warnings by the standard of a decade of realities. The book is weak on anti-aircraft guns, for example, and still more negligent of submarines. Much, no doubt, will strike the reader as quaint and limited but upon much the writer may not unreasonably plume himself. The interpretation of the German spirit must have read as a caricature in 1908. Was it a caricature? Prince Karl seemed a fantasy then. Reality has since copied Prince Carl with an astonishing faithfulness. Is it too much to hope that some democratic [...] "Bert" [...] may not ultimately get even with his Highness? Our author tells us in this book, as he has told us in others, more especially in The World Set Free, and as he has been telling us this year in his War and the Future, that if mankind goes on with war, the smash-up of civilization is inevitable. It is chaos or the United States of the World for mankind. There is no other choice. Ten years have but added an enormous conviction to <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> book. It remains essentially right, a pamphlet story--in support of the League to Enforce Peace. K.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Detecting {{termination}} of a distributed computation {{is a fundamental}} problem in distributed systems. We present two optimal algorithms for detecting {{termination of}} a non-diffusing distributed computation for an arbitrary topology. Both algorithms are optimal in terms <b>of</b> <b>message</b> complexity and detection latency. The first termination detection algorithm has to be initiated along with the underlying computation. <b>The</b> <b>message</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> algorithm is Θ(N + M) and its detection latency is Θ(D), where N {{is the number of}} processes in the system, M is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> application <b>messages</b> exchanged by <b>the</b> underlying computation, and D is the diameter of the communication topology. The second termination detection algorithm can be initiated at any time after the underlying computation has started. <b>The</b> <b>message</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> algorithm is Θ(E + M) and its detection latency is Θ(D), where E is the number of channels in the communication topology. Key words: termination detection, quiescence detection, optimal message complexity, optimal detection latency...|$|R
