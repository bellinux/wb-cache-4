Pre-service classroom <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> been joined in this research. In order to determine the pre-service teachers’ views about the nature of technology ″Views on Science-Technology-Society (VOSTS) which was designed by Aikenhead, Fleming and Ryan (1989) instrument was used.

25|$|In the Middle Ages {{the cathedral}} also functioned as an {{important}} cathedral school. In the early 11th century Bishop Fulbert established Chartres {{as one of the}} leading schools in Europe. Although the role of Fulbert himself as a scholar and <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> been questioned, perhaps his greatest talent was as an administrator, who established the conditions in which the school could flourish, as well as laying the foundations for the rebuilding of the cathedral after the fire of 1020. Great scholars were attracted to the cathedral school, including Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and the Englishman John of Salisbury. These men were {{at the forefront of the}} intense intellectual rethinking that culminated in what is now known as the twelfth-century renaissance, pioneering the Scholastic philosophy that came to dominate medieval thinking throughout Europe.|$|E
500|$|It {{is only in}} the 1990s and 2000s that Barbauld {{and other}} female {{educational}} writers are beginning to be acknowledged in the history of children's literature and, indeed, in the history of literature itself. As Myers points out, [...] "the writing woman as <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> not captured the imagination of feminist scholars", and Barbauld's children's works are usually consigned to [...] "the backwaters of children's literature surveys, usually deplored for their pernicious effect on the emergent cultural construction of Romantic childhood, or in the margins of commentary on male high Romanticism, a minor inspiration for Blake or Wordsworth perhaps". The male Romantics did not explore didactic genres that illustrated educational progress; rather, as Myers explains, their works embodied a [...] "nostalgia for lost youth and [...] pervasive valorization of instinctive juvenile wisdom" [...] not shared by many female writers at this time.|$|E
500|$|... {{consider}} {{a model of}} classroom scheduling [...] in which a set of n teachers must be scheduled to teach each of m cohorts of students. The number of hours per week that teacher i spends with cohort j is described by entry Rij of a matrix R given as input to the problem, and each teacher also has a set of hours during {{which he or she}} is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is NP-complete, even when each <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when each teacher only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable vij corresponds to an hour that teacher i must spend with cohort j, the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher's available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned to a teacher {{at the same time as}} each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|It is essential, {{according}} to Dewey, that the classroom <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> the mental propensity {{to overcome the}} demands and stressors placed on her because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] Such negative demeanors, {{according to}} Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. [...] It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers {{must be aware of}} how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.|$|E

Their methods in the classroom have changed because of new technology and the implementation of e-learning (Loogma 2010). Changes in teaching, emerging from new target groups and the growing diversity of student populations (e.g. increasing numbers of students with special needs), have also brought new roles as shown in other studies (Ümarik and Rekkor 2013; Loogma 2010). <b>Teachers</b> <b>have</b> to support these students in the learning process in ways that differ from the support they offer other students in order to make sure the students stay in school (Espenberg et al. 2012). VET <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> had different experiences and attitudes regarding the national curriculum development and implementation process in their work. Therefore, some <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> adopted the changes more easily than others (Rekkor et al. 2013).

2500|$|During the Japanese Occupation (February 1942 - September 1945), {{the school}} {{ceased to exist}} as it was shut down by the Japanese {{military}} administration. After the Japanese surrender, the British Military Administration took charge of Singapore and {{attempts were made to}} revive the school again. The school had lost most of its administrative documents, records, its former students and teachers at the aftermath of the war. The school was finally re-opened on the premises of Outram School by headmaster, Percival Frank Aroozoo on 13 May 1946. Aroozoo, a Eurasian of Portuguese descent was the grandson of Simon Aroozoo, who happened to be a close friend and colleague of Gan Eng Seng when both men worked together at Guthrie and Company for fifty years. A year later, the school was moved to the former Japanese National School building (now the Stamford Arts Centre) at No. 155 Waterloo Street and remained there until 1951. During this period, GESS was still a primary school. The teething problems were soon over and on December 1949, Aroozoo launched the school's periodical, Onward to chronicalise the legacy and milestones of the school. On 29 May 1950, GESS became the first school in Singapore to form the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). Its formation was an initiative by Aroozoo: [...] "Parents as much as the <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> {{a great deal to do}} with the training and development of a child as a useful member of the community." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 1987 {{study at}} Indiana University Bloomington used 14 Mechanical Universe episodes {{as part of}} an {{introductory}} course on Newtonian mechanics, with generally positive results:hese tapes were particularly effective in placing Newtonian mechanics in a historical perspective; dramatizing the historical overthrow of Aristotelian and medieval ideas; illustrating the diverse nature of scientists and the scientific endeavor; stimulating student interest and enthusiasm; and, through excellent animation, illustrating the time dimension of certain mechanics concepts. The companion text [...] was placed on library reserve for the course but was not extensively utilized by students.A follow-up study found that the videos could also be helpful explaining physics to professors in other fields. Negative reactions generally had less to do with the intrinsic perceived quality of the episodes than with the time the science-history material took away from content seen as [...] "critical exam-preparing instruction". The investigator recalled,ome students, thinking that the videotape material would not be covered on the tests, headed for the doors when the lights dimmed! To counter this tendency I started to use a few test questions based on historical or literary details discussed in the videotapes. Some students were outraged: [...] "What is this, a poetry class?"A 2005 column in The Physics Teacher suggested The Mechanical Universe as preparatory viewing for instructors attempting to teach physics for the first time.
