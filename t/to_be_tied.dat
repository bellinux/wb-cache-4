5|$|The Horse Project has an {{official}} website, which encourages participation, and offers instructions for tethering. The project accepts donations and volunteer support. Participants considered selling kits for consumers interested in tethering horses. One Portland resident has reportedly installed more than 150 horses. Horses {{are the most}} frequent animal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> to rings, but pigs, dolls, and other animals have also appeared throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Applications {{for grants}} from the Nordic Game Program, which had funded Limbo initial development, {{increased}} 50% {{in the second half}} of 2010, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> to the game's success. Playdead was able to buy itself back from its investors in August 2011 from the revenue made from sales of Limbo. Playdead's follow-up title, Inside, first released in June 2016, is visually and thematically similar to Limbo, and includes some elements that were cut from Limbo development.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's {{basketball}} season head coach Mitch Henderson began his tenure at Princeton, taking over for Sydney Johnson. With the move {{that resulted from}} Johnson taking a new coaching job, Princeton has six alumni who are active Division I head coaches, a total second only to eight by the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program. The Ivy League media poll selected Princeton <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> with Yale for second place behind Harvard. Princeton had been the preseason favorite the year before.|$|E

5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E
5|$|Journalists {{noted that}} many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked {{negative}} opinion of the game, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> to the minimal impact on Portal 2s release time. These users cited complaints about the game being too short (with some saying it is only four hours long), the existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions, and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version. Journalists have defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co-op mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E
5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.|$|E

25|$|According to Danish scholar Miriam K. Zeitzen, anthropologists treat serial monogamy, {{in which}} divorce and {{remarriage}} occur, {{as a form}} of polygamy as it also can establish a series of households that may continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> by shared paternity and shared income. As such, they are similar to the household formations created through divorce and serial monogamy.|$|E
25|$|The reins {{were mostly}} {{the same as}} those in use in the 19th century, and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal.

25|$|The modern Western saddle was {{developed}} from the Spanish saddles that were brought by the Spanish Conquistadors {{when they came to}} the Americas.

During this period, Zamboanga City earned the appellation as the cleanest city in the Philippines.
