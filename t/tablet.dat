5|$|All 24 tablets of {{the fourth}} row, {{designed}} and manufactured by Royal Doulton, were added as a single batch in August 1908. A single Royal Doulton <b>tablet</b> to PC Alfred Smith was added in June 1919, followed in October 1930 by similar Royal Doulton tablets to three further police officers, and a replacement <b>tablet</b> with the correct details of the East Ham Sewage Works incident of 1895. A single <b>tablet</b> made by Fred Passenger in the original DeMorgan style, honouring schoolboy Herbert Maconoghu, was added in April 1931 {{to fill the gap}} in the centre row left by the removal of the original, incorrect <b>tablet</b> to the victims of the East Ham Sewage Works incident. In 2009 a 54th <b>tablet</b> was added, {{in the style of the}} Royal Doulton tiles, to commemorate print technician Leigh Pitt, the first addition to the wall for 78 years.|$|E

5|$|At {{the launch}} event, Barra {{announced}} that the <b>tablet</b> would initially be shipped to Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the <b>tablet</b> {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the <b>tablet</b> will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the <b>tablet,</b> he will explain he wishes to use the <b>tablet</b> for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the <b>tablet</b> to Yeesha, the <b>tablet</b> simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the <b>tablet,</b> ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|At this time, one of De Morgan's 1902 tablets was removed. Commemorating four {{workers who}} had died in an {{accident}} at the East Ham Sewage Works in 1895, Watts had mistakenly listed the incident as having taken place at the West Ham Sewage Works in 1885. The DeMorgan <b>tablet</b> was removed and replaced with a Royal Doulton <b>tablet</b> giving the correct location and date. As the Doulton tablets were in such a different style to DeMorgan's, the replacement <b>tablet</b> was installed in the second row next to the three new tablets to police officers, rather than in the space left by the original.|$|E

40|$|Fast-disintegrating (FD) <b>tablets</b> {{containing}} nicorandil-loaded dry emulsions {{were prepared}} and their controlledrelease properties were examined and {{compared with the}} plain FD <b>tablets</b> (FD <b>tablets</b> without dry emulsions) and commercial <b>tablets.</b> The dry emulsions were prepared with myristyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and their property was modified by mixing {{the ratio of the}} two alcohols. Disintegration time of the prepared FD <b>tablets</b> was sufficiently fast (i. e., 12 to 23 s). In vitro release of nicorandil from the FD <b>tablets</b> containing the dry emulsions was sustained over 6 h, while that from plain FD and commercial <b>tablets</b> was complate within 5 min. In vivo absorption of nicorandil from the <b>tablets</b> was evaluated by oral administration in beagle dogs. FD <b>tablets</b> containing dry emulsions showed a similar AUC, lower Cmax, and delayed Tmax compared to the plain FD and commercial <b>tablets.</b> These results suggest that the dry emulsionloaded FD <b>tablets</b> can be utilized to improve the sustained-release property of active drugs...|$|R
