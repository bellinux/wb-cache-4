The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given.

5|$|The {{variations}} {{between the}} AADT and the ASDT traffic volumes are attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> motorway carries certain tourist traffic from Hungary to the Croatian motorway network {{and ultimately to}} the Adriatic Sea.
