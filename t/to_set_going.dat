6000|$|... "Yes. Tomassov {{had done}} it. Destiny had led that De Castel {{to the man}} who could {{understand}} him perfectly. But it was poor Tomassov's lot to be the predestined victim. You know what the world's justice and mankind's judgment are like. They fell heavily on him with a sort of inverted hypocrisy. Why! That brute of an adjutant, himself, was the first <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>going</b> horrified allusions to the shooting of a prisoner in cold blood! Tomassov was not dismissed from the service of course. But after the siege of Dantzig he asked for permission to resign from the army, and went away to bury himself in the depths of his province, where a vague story of some dark deed clung to him for years.|$|E
6000|$|After all, however, {{there was}} a dull space of time which needed {{relieving}} with bread and cheese and ale, {{and when he was}} seated alone with these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly slapped his knee, and exclaimed, [...] "Ladislaw!" [...] That action of memory which he had tried <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>going,</b> and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly completed itself without conscious effort--a common experience, agreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no value. Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the name, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not being at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to tell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like that of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{did you do}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> him <b>going?</b> Don't scream so, you 'll frighten Polly!" [...] and Fan {{gave the}} cherub a shake, which {{produced}} an explanation.|$|R
6000|$|With some {{difficulty}} the Jew preserved his gravity. [...] "Very well," [...] he resumed. [...] "I {{will make it}} up to sixty pounds (<b>to</b> <b>set</b> you <b>going</b> again) on two conditions." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{lips were}} {{compressed}} for another 'Pshaw,' when he bethought himself. 'Well, I don't know--the more the better. Only it won't {{do for you}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going.</b> Flora must be the woman for that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{clock in}} the count's chamber has stopped, and it wearies him to lie there and not know how the time passes, so he has {{requested}} you to fetch in a craftsman <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going</b> again." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} was saved. Conversationally, I am like a clockwork toy. I have <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>going.</b> On {{the affairs of}} the farm I could speak fluently. I sketched for her the progress we had made since her visit. I was humorous concerning roop, epigrammatic {{on the subject of the}} Hired Retainer and Edwin.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do mention it," [...] protested his lordship, shrilly. [...] "It just proves what I say. If I had had {{a decent}} allowance, it wouldn't have happened. And you wouldn't give me enough <b>to</b> <b>set</b> me <b>going</b> in the {{diplomatic}} service. That's another thing. Why wouldn't you do that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I do love <b>to</b> <b>set</b> her <b>going,</b> Mistress Blythe," [...] chuckled the unrepentant sinner. [...] "It's the {{greatest}} amusement I have in life. That tongue of hers would blister a stone. And {{you and that}} young dog of a doctor enj'y listening to {{her as much as}} I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} {{the first thing is}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the stove <b>going.</b> Guess if I'm going to get on a record hustle I want my breakfast." ...|$|R
60|$|After poking {{under the}} clock in the dark, and failing <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the {{pendulum}} <b>going</b> again properly in that way, she next attempted to lift the clock, {{and give it a}} shake. It was set in a marble case, with a bronze figure on the top; and it was so heavy that she was obliged to hunt for something which she could use as a lever. The thing proved to be not easy to find {{on the spur of the}} moment. Having at last laid her hand on what she wanted, she contrived so to lift the clock a few inches and drop it again on the mantelpiece, as <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going</b> once more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, he won't! I'm sure he won't. Things {{always do}} come right. Oh, what a coup d'etat mine was after all! Things always do come right. You, that {{were born to}} it! Didn't old Tripp say how they had had the bells rung for you? I should like <b>to</b> <b>set</b> them <b>going</b> this minute!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I could {{but take}} all with me!' said Nuttie. 'Oh dear! {{whatever}} will you do, Aunt Ursel? Oh mother, the choir! Who {{will play the}} harmonium? and who will lead the girls? and whatever will Mr. Spyers do? and who will take my class? Mother, couldn't we stay a little longer <b>to</b> <b>set</b> things <b>going</b> here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well:--and so {{you came}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going.</b> It is very good-natured of you, John. I {{depended}} on you or Theodora for helping me through, but I {{did not think}} you would have come in this way. I am glad you have, for now you have seen her you can't say a word against it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Being {{permitted}} to reach land in safety, I prepared to eclipse Fan's ring and Mary's necklace with my rich and rare rococo watch. But I {{found it impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going,</b> though I tried all the keys in the house, so I took it to an experienced watchmaker and left it to be regulated. Every one knows what that means, and can imagine my impatience as week after week went by and still that blessed thing was not done. It came at last, however, and with it a bill that startled me; but I could not dispute it, for the job was a difficult one, owing to the antiquity of the works and the skill required <b>to</b> <b>set</b> a watch <b>going</b> that probably had not been wound up for half a century.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad that}} I have seen her," [...] said Mrs. Arnott. [...] "I {{should never have}} {{understood}} her by description. I always said that I must come home <b>to</b> <b>set</b> my correspondence <b>going</b> rightly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic gave resounding {{approval}} <b>to</b> the <b>set,</b> <b>going</b> {{so far as}} {{to claim}} that all 78 songs are [...] "timeless classics," [...] making it the ideal purchase for the casual listener. They also praised the booklet included, especially the Police biography, and asserted that the digital remastering is so superior to the sound quality of the original releases that they would recommend the purchase even to those who already have all the recordings on the box set.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} {{saw my father}} not long since?" [...] Bertram said this, not quite knowing how <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the {{conversation}} <b>going,</b> {{so that he might}} bring in the tidings he had come there to communicate.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never told}} us that before!" [...] "The Davenports have been away some years, and I forgot all about them. But when I was making my plan, I knew I must have a good name or two <b>to</b> <b>set</b> me <b>going,</b> so I just wrote and asked Mrs. D. if she would help me. She came and saw us and was very kind, and has got these pupils for me, like a dear, good woman as she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Hobson's choice," [...] {{the young}} man remarked. [...] "We must try some bold stroke of the sort. Have you chosen the right sort of men for agents? You should have men of some {{standing}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> such reports <b>going.</b> They would have more weight then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Jack Hopkins, 'just <b>to</b> <b>set</b> us <b>going</b> again, Bob, I don't mind {{singing a}} song.' And Hopkins, incited thereto by tumultuous applause, plunged himself at once into 'The King, God bless him,' which he sang {{as loud as}} he could, to a novel air, {{compounded}} of the 'Bay of Biscay,' and 'A Frog he would.' The chorus was {{the essence of the}} song; and, as each gentleman sang it to the tune he knew best, the effect was very striking indeed.|$|R
40|$|It is so {{tempting to}} try and tell our {{learners}} “all the things” in the limited time in which we see them. This keynote will challenge that approach to teaching information skills, recommending instead that we use play and creative approaches <b>to</b> <b>set</b> sparks <b>going</b> inside our learners’ minds. This talk will include playful interactions, giving attendees “permission to play” with the ideas presented, along with outlining why attendees should use play in their teaching, and examples of how play and games are used in libraries...|$|R
6000|$|... "We say yes, to be sure," [...] {{answered}} Allan. [...] "I {{think our}} spirits {{have been a}} little dashed by Mr. Pentecost's illness and Mrs. Pentecost's bag," [...] he added, in a whisper to Miss Milroy. [...] "A change of this sort is the very thing we want <b>to</b> <b>set</b> us all <b>going</b> again." ...|$|R
60|$|It was the Sewing Circle day again--at Sarah Gardiner's this time. I was late; {{everybody}} else was there when I arrived, and the minute I entered the room I knew something had happened, although I couldn't imagine what. Everybody looked {{at me in the}} strangest way. Of course, Wilhelmina Mercer was the first <b>to</b> <b>set</b> her tongue <b>going.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first act, The Course of the Years, is {{performed}} as a ballet, {{accompanied by a}} tenor, bass, actor-singers, modern orchestra, tape and sound projectionist. Lucifer challenges Michael to a contest, a race of the years. He, Lucifer, will attempt {{to stop the flow}} of time, and Michael shall try <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going</b> again. Four dancers personify the years, the decades, the centuries, and the millennia, while four groups of musicians play music in four corresponding temporal layers. Lucifer stops the race four times with temptations, and each time Michael finds incitements to get it going again [...]|$|R
6000|$|By degrees, as she sat, Felice's mind--helped {{perhaps by}} the anticlimax of {{learning}} that her lover was unharmed after all her fright about him--grew wondrously strong in wise resolve. For the moment {{she was in a}} mood, in the words of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, [...] "to run mad with discretion;" [...] and was so persuaded that discretion lay in departure that she wished <b>to</b> <b>set</b> about <b>going</b> that very minute. Jumping up from her seat, she began to gather together some small personal knick-knacks scattered about the room, to feel that preparations were really in train.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{the poor}} fire-fly has lit the lamp of {{learning}} for six idle children, no other cause for dimness need be sought. No, I was well and wicked in {{the height of}} the pain, and long after it wore out--for wear out it did--and I am glad he is too wise <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going</b> again. I don't like emotions. I only want to be let alone. Besides, he has got into such a region of goodness, that his wife ought to be super-excellent. I know no one good enough for him unless you would have him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bannadonna," [...] {{said the}} chief, [...] "how long ere {{you are ready}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the clock <b>going,</b> so that the hour shall be sounded? Our {{interest}} in you, not less than in the work itself, makes us anxious to be assured of your success. The people, too,--why, they are shouting now. Say the exact hour when you will be ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strong's his man of business, {{draws the}} Governor's bills, and indosses 'em, and does his odd jobs and that; and I suppose Altamont's in it too," [...] Mr. Lightfoot replied. [...] "That kite-flying, you know, Mr. M., always takes {{two or three}} on 'em <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the paper <b>going.</b> Altamont put the pot on at the Derby, and won {{a good bit of}} money. I wish the Governor could get some somewhere, and I could get my book paid up." ...|$|R
50|$|The Liskeard and Looe Railway {{was opened}} on 27 December 1860 to carry goods traffic; {{passenger}} trains running from 11 September 1879. The railway {{in those days}} connected with the Liskeard and Caradon Railway at Moorswater {{and there was no}} station at Coombe but a platform was provided here from 1896 and trains would call <b>to</b> <b>set</b> down passengers <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Liskeard railway station if they notified the guard, as the steep road from Coombe to the station was considerably shorter than the route from Moorswater through Liskeard.|$|R
60|$|Medical men are, as a class, {{very much}} {{too busy to}} take stock of {{singular}} situations or dramatic events. Thus it happens that the ablest chronicler of their experiences in our literature was a lawyer. A life spent in watching over death-beds--or over birth-beds which are infinitely more trying--takes something from a man's sense of proportion, as constant strong waters might corrupt his palate. The overstimulated nerve ceases to respond. Ask the surgeon for his best experiences and he may reply that he has seen little that is remarkable, or break away into the technical. But catch him some night when the fire has spurted up and his pipe is reeking, with a few of his brother practitioners for company and an artful question or allusion <b>to</b> <b>set</b> him <b>going.</b> Then you will get some raw, green facts new plucked from the tree of life.|$|R
60|$|Helena {{has left}} {{home on a}} visit to a {{northern}} town by the seaside. She is staying in the house of a minister (one of papa's friends), and is occupying a position of dignity in which I should certainly lose my head. The minister and his wife and daughters propose <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up a Girls' Scripture Class, on the plan devised by papa; and they are at a loss, poor helpless people, to know how to begin. Helena has volunteered <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the thing <b>going.</b> And there she is now, advising everybody, governing everybody, encouraging everybody--issuing directions, finding fault, rewarding merit--oh, dear, let me put it all in one word, and say: thoroughly enjoying herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must marry an heiress, Lionel," [...] Geoffrey laughed. [...] "Surely Sir Lionel Vickars, one of {{the heroes}} of Nieuport, and many another field, {{should be able to}} win the heart of some fair English damsel, with broad acres as her dower. But seriously, Lionel," [...] he went on, {{changing}} his tone, [...] "if peace come, and with it lack of employment, the best thing for you will be to join me. Mendez is getting on in years; and although he is working hard at present, in order, as he says, <b>to</b> <b>set</b> everything <b>going</b> smoothly and well here, he is looking forward to taking matters more easily, and to spending his time in tranquil pleasure with Dolores and her children. Therefore, whensoever it pleases you, there is a place for you here. We always contemplated our lines running in the same groove, and I should be glad that they should do so still. When the time comes we can discuss what share you shall have of the business; but at any rate I can promise you that it shall be sufficient to make you a rich man." ...|$|R
60|$|The old palmer did {{his best}} to prolong a mood so {{beneficial}} to the wounded young man. The surgeon also nodded approval, and attributed this happy state of the patient's mind, and all the physical advantages growing out of it, to his own consummate skill; nor, indeed, was he undeserving of credit, not often to be awarded to medical men, for having done nothing to impede the good which kind Nature was willing to bring about. She was doing the patient more good, indeed, than either the surgeon or the palmer could fully estimate, in taking this opportunity to recreate a mind that had too early known stirring impulse, and that had been worked to a degree beyond what its organization (in some respects singularly delicate) ought to have borne. Once in a long while the weary actors in the headlong drama of life must have such repose or else go mad or die. When the machinery of human life has once been stopped by sickness or other impediment, it often needs an impulse <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it <b>going</b> again, even after it is nearly wound up.|$|R
50|$|They faced {{off again}} {{a month later}} in the final of Wimbledon, which was their first meeting on grass. Federer won in four <b>sets</b> <b>to</b> capture his fourth {{consecutive}} Wimbledon title with two <b>sets</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tiebreakers.|$|R
60|$|But {{the largest}} and most {{important}} company of loungers was that towards which Tito had to direct his steps. It was the busiest time of the day with Nello, and in this warm season and at an hour when clients were numerous, most men preferred being shaved under the pretty red and white awning in front of the shop rather than within narrow walls. It is not a sublime attitude for a man, to sit with lathered chin thrown backward, and have his nose made a handle of; but to be shaved was a fashion of Florentine respectability, and it is astonishing how gravely men look at each other when they are all in the fashion. It was the hour of the day, too, when yesterday's crop of gossip was freshest, and the barber's tongue was always in its glory when his razor was busy; the deft activity of those two instruments seemed <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>going</b> by a common spring. Tito foresaw that it would be impossible for him to escape being drawn into the circle; he must smile and retort, and look perfectly at his ease. Well! it was but the ordeal of swallowing bread and cheese pills after all. The man who let the mere anticipation of discovery choke him was simply a man of weak nerves.|$|R
