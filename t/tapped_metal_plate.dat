5000|$|As screw heads {{damage the}} wood and could put extra stress on it, {{typically}} a rectangular <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> or a pair of <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> are used to secure the joint and re-distribute the screw pressure evenly. Such a plate is usually criticized for making playing on top frets uncomfortable, so, manufacturers sometimes employ some kind of more intricate method to hide a <b>metal</b> <b>plate,</b> smooth the angles and make access to top frets easier. However, a visible <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> is usually considered {{as a part of}} [...] "vintage" [...] style and they are a popular place to emboss manufacturer's logos, stamp out serial numbers and put other artwork.|$|R

50|$|Charge in the {{universe}} is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the <b>metal</b> <b>plate).</b> This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by raising the charged <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential {{energy in the form}} of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so raising the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> actually increases its voltage relative to the dielectic plate.|$|R

40|$|Uniformity of the {{temperature}} in the mold plate is of paramount important since it will affect the dimensional stability of the part produced. To provide uniform temperature to the <b>metal</b> <b>plate,</b> many factors need to be considered such as choice of heating technology, uniformity of a heat source, a type of control, etc. This paper aims to study {{the temperature}} uniformity of <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> using closed-loop oscillating heat pipe (CLOHP) as a heat transfer device. The <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> which were P- 20 with the size of 306 x 130 mm 2 were used. <b>Metal</b> <b>plate</b> was gouged to a depth of 3 mm for installing the CLOHP. Distances from the heating device to the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> surface were 5 and 10 mm. The surface temperatures of the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> were controlled at 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 °C. Sixteen pointa of temperature were recorded. The results were then compared to those using the heat source as the cartridge heater arranged in the similar way with the same heating capacity. Once the system entered the steady state, {{it was found that the}} temperature distribution of <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> using the CLOHP has a deviation in the range of ± 1. 00 °C and ± 0. 94 °C at the CLOHP depth of 5 mm. and 10 mm., respectively. While those of using cartridge heater deviated in the range of ± 1. 35 °C and ± 1. 16 °C. Compare to the recommended value from the ASTM Standard that the mold surface temperature need to be in the range of ± 2. 0 °C, the CLOHP shows the very promising results...|$|R

40|$|A {{broadband}} microstrip-to-waveguide transition {{has been}} studied and tested for low-cost microwave circuits on FR 4 multilayer boards having an internal thick <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> (1). It is obtained, at first, milling a slot in a thick <b>metal</b> <b>plate.</b> Subsequently the PCB is built up, using standard PCB process, inserting the thick <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> as the second layer. In this way the slot results filled with FR 4 prepreg. A further simple milling process removes the lower layers up to the thick <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> and creates {{a part of the}} waveguide transformer and an area for <b>plate</b> to <b>metal</b> housing connection. The transition integration in the multilayer is obtained just fixing the board on the metal housing which includes the rest of the transformer and the waveguide. Moreover, as the transition shows low sensitivity to manufacturing tolerances, the above process is characterised by high reliability and reproducibility...|$|R
