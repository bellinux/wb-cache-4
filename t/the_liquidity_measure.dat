40|$|Purpose - The study {{sought to}} examine <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> {{linkages}} between <b>the</b> South African bond and equity markets before the global financial crisis in 2008. Design/methodology/approach: The window of observation covered the period January 2000 to September 2008. In order to ensure robustness in the estimation, the study used foreign participation in the various markets as an additional <b>measure</b> of <b>liquidity.</b> <b>The</b> other <b>liquidity</b> <b>measures</b> considered in <b>the</b> study were volume and value traded of the various securities respectively. Time series modeling techniques {{were used in the}} estimation. An unrestricted vector autoregressive (VAR) model was estimated following which the standard innovation accounting techniques, impulse response functions and forecast error variance decompositions were applied. In the empirical analysis, the Granger-causality between the two markets was also used. Findings - While all <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>measures</b> suggest <b>the</b> existence of linkages between the bond and equity markets, the direction of causality was found to be unidirectional from equity to the bond market using the volume and value measures. On the other hand, the foreign participation <b>measure</b> of <b>liquidity</b> suggests bi-directional causality. The study also provides evidence of long run relationship between key macroeconomic variables such as inflation, exchange rate and interest rate on one hand and <b>liquidity</b> in <b>the</b> debt and equity markets on the other. As empirical findings indicates that <b>the</b> linkages in <b>liquidity</b> between these markets positive, this consistent with studies conducted by Chordia et al (2003 & 2005) and Engsted and Tanggaard (2000) who found the relationship was a positive one.

40|$|Policy-makers and {{academics}} recognize that liquidity is central in {{the dynamics of}} a financial crisis, and that measurement of liquidity is critical in evaluating and regulating systemic risk. 2 The proposed Basel Liquidity Coverage Ratio, for example, calls for banks to maintain a sufficient buffer of liquid assets to cover outflows over the next thirty days.

The author utilizes the Liquidity-Adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model (LCAPM) recently developed by Acharya and Pedersen (2005) to test whether liquidity level and risks significantly affect stock returns. Three different liquidity measures – Amihud, FHT, and PQS – are incorporated into the model to find any difference between the results they could provide. It appears that the findings largely depend on <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>measure</b> used. In general the results exhibit more evidence for insignificant influence of liquidity level and risks as well as market risk on stock returns. The similar conclusion was reported earlier by Lee (2011) for several regions, including France. This finding of the thesis, however, is not consistent across all the liquidity measures. Nevertheless, the difference in the results between these measures provides new insight to the existing literature on this topic. The Amihud-based findings might indicate that market resiliency is not priced in the French stock market. At the same time the contradicting results from FHT and PQS provide some foundation for the hypothesis that one of two leftover liquidity dimensions – market depth or breadth – could significantly affect stock returns.

Balancing these lofty returns are the liquidity concerns of trading in emerging markets. Adopting the model of security returns developed by Lesmond, Ogden, and Trzcinka (1999), liquidity measures are estimated for all securities and time periods (63798 firm-years) for which daily prices are available in 31 emerging markets from 1991 to 2000. Significant cross-sectional differences and time-series variations typify <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>measure</b> over the period 1991 to 2000.

Previous studies have documented that liquidity providers manage additional uncertainty by decreasing liquidity exposure – widening the spread and reducing the depth. In the immediate aftermarket, however, I document that quoted spread is the only dimension along which <b>the</b> <b>liquidity</b> providers manage <b>the</b> additional uncertainty. I also document that the magnitude of the quoted spread increases as the time since the IPO elapses, which supports the hypothesis that the market makers have an incentive to offer additional <b>liquidity</b> to ensure <b>the</b> success of the offering. Surprisingly, the magnitude of spread increases seems to have negligible effect on post-event return predictability on daily basis. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} empirical studies on <b>liquidity</b> <b>measuring</b> of financial market in the Western Balkan region (<b>the</b> Serbian market). <b>Liquidity</b> itself is not observable and therefore, has to be proxies by different <b>liquidity</b> <b>measures.</b> <b>The</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>measures</b> covered in this paper are: Bid-Ask Spread, Amivest’s measure, Amihud’s measure, Amihud’s based measure, zero-return proportion, and price pressure of non-trading. Market liquidity is a fundamental aspect of market development. In order integrate Serbian market into EU financial market, structural change is required. Serbian market belongs to frontier markets. One of the major requirements that this market transforms to emerging, and then to develop market is to improve its liquidity. For empirical analysis of Serbian market liquidity we use two measures: zero-return proportion and price pressure of non-trading as in Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2007), for the period: 2005 - 2009. Results of this paper showed that the Serbian market is extremely illiquid. It {{is just one of}} the key barriers that foreign investors face while investing in the Western Balkan region. Additionally, for whole the Serbian market, the most illiquid year was 2008, while the least illiquid year was 2007, according to the value of zero-return proportion. Particularly, in the post-crises period level of illiquidity increased for both BELEX indices...|$|R
