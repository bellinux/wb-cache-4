5|$|For this thirteenth season, Seven {{chose to}} move Blue Heelers from its Wednesday-night, primetime <b>timeslot,</b> {{which it had}} {{occupied}} for 10 years, to the lower-rated Saturday-night <b>timeslot,</b> which also saw it up against popular British police programme The Bill; this move was slammed by cast member John Wood. Ratings for this season were generally low; no episode ranked in OzTAM's top 20 programme list for the week.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth and}} final season of The O.C., an American teen drama {{television}} series, aired in the United States from November 2, 2006 to February 22, 2007 and consisted of sixteen episodes. The O.Cs final season aired Thursdays at 9:00p.m. ET in the United States on Fox, a terrestrial television network. Fox tested a new <b>timeslot</b> by airing the second episode on Wednesday at 9:00p.m. ET against ABC's Lost and CBS's Criminal Minds. With Lost about to enter a three-month hiatus, Fox hoped that changing the <b>timeslot</b> for The O.C. would attract back viewers it had lost {{since the end of}} the previous season; however, the move was unsuccessful and the show returned to its Thursday <b>timeslot.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} on a Saturday night <b>timeslot</b> as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely to}} watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks would boost its <b>timeslot.</b> However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm <b>timeslot,</b> and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun of the coverage of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC Choice. In the US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes edited out to accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|E

50|$|Some {{high end}} mobiles, usually also {{supporting}} UMTS, also support GPRS/EDGE multislot class 32. According to 3GPP TS 45.002 (Release 12), Table B.1, mobile stations of this class support 5 <b>timeslots</b> in downlink and 3 <b>timeslots</b> in uplink {{with a maximum}} number of 6 simultaneously used <b>timeslots.</b> If data traffic is concentrated in downlink direction the network will configure the connection for 5+1 operation. When more data is transferred in the uplink the network can at any time change the constellation to 4+2 or 3+3. Under the best reception conditions, i.e. when the best EDGE modulation and coding scheme can be used, 5 <b>timeslots</b> can carry a bandwidth of 5*59.2 kbit/s = 296 kbit/s. In uplink direction, 3 <b>timeslots</b> can carry a bandwidth of 3*59.2 kbit/s = 177.6 kbit/s.|$|R
40|$|EasyMap MAC {{protocol}} {{is a new}} {{and simple}} Medium Access Control protocol, which allows a wireless sensor network to operate with low power and good throughput. This new protocol is specially designed for the applications which collect data on a relatively regular schedule and which are required to last {{for a long period}} of time. EasyMap medium access control protocol fits especially well for the wireless networks in which the wireless sensor nodes are deployed in a linear topology − such as a wireless sensor network for bridge monitoring, oil pipe monitoring, power distribution system monitoring, etc. A special feature of this protocol is that each node transmits relatively short beacon message of its own in order to announce its presence and to send signalling information related to the availability <b>timeslots.</b> Such mechanisms address the hidden node problem and allow the sensor nodes to go to sleep for a large fraction of time and save energy. In this protocol, nodes are synchronized, and the time line consists of a series of superframes. Each superframe contains control <b>timeslots</b> and application <b>timeslots.</b> The relatively shorter length of the control <b>timeslots</b> and the consecutive placement of the control <b>timeslots</b> in a frame in EasyMap make more application <b>timeslots</b> available for data transmission or reception...|$|R

5|$|This season focuses {{primarily}} on the show's main protagonist, Senior Sergeant Tom Croydon, his failing health and his personal troubles. John Wood, who portrays Croydon, is the only actor to appear in every episode of Blue Heelers and is, indisputably, the pillar of the show. The final episode of the thirteenth season aired as a 2-hour, movie-length tribute starting with an introduction from John Wood, and concluding with a compilation of Blue Heelers moments from over its 13-season run. For this thirteenth season, Blue Heelers was moved from its primetime Wednesday-night <b>timeslot</b> to the lower rating Saturday-night <b>timeslot,</b> which saw it come up against The Bill, a British police drama which has become quite popular in Australia. Ratings for this season, partially due to the series' move to its lower-rating <b>timeslot,</b> were relatively low; ratings were around the 1.2 million viewer mark, increasing to 1.5 million for the finale. Blue Heelers failed to even {{make it into the}} top 20 programmes at any time during its thirteenth season.|$|E
