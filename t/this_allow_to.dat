Then, we can bound exponents and degree of the pull-back maps and further list all possible ramification cases. This generalizes a result due to C. Doran for the Painleve VI case. We explicitely construct one of these solutions. Comment: 22 page...|$|E

It is thus found that the asymptotic state predicted by bosonization is consistent with the prethermalized state. From the bosonized representation, we explicitly construct the Generalized Gibbs Ensamble that describes the prethermalized state. A protocol to perform an interaction quantum quench in a dipolar gas of Erbium atoms is also described. Comment: 9 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

Our analysis of the gap labelling in the quasi-momentum space opens the way to an experimental proof of the gap labelling itself within the framework of an optics experiment, polaritons, or with ultracold atoms.

40|$|Several smart {{materials}} such as shape memory alloys (SMA) and electroactive polymers (EAP) have good properties in small scales and are often {{a good choice for}} tiny surface deflection applications. However they need continuous powering to keep their shape change, leading to a significant loss of energy. An interesting approach is to associate a smart material with a bistable element, which provides two stable positions without power. This action requires some energy to snap from one position to the other one. This association gives a very power-efficient solution. In this paper, we present a mechanical study on the actuation of a bistable structure, using a distributed torque actuation that is very suitable for smart materials.
