Throughout the 1990s, he and his colleagues took the methodology from a relatively unknown study by James Deese from 1959 and worked to develop it into one of the most widely used tools in human memory research; the DRM Paradigm. In a typical DRM experiment, a subject listens to a list of related words, for example; <b>Thread,</b> Pin, <b>Eye,</b> Sewing, Sharp, Point, Prick, Thimble, Haystack, Torn, Hurt, Injection, Syringe, Cloth, Knitting, and is then tested on their memory for this list. Typically, subjects will recall or recognise an associated, but unpresented lure word (Needle). Roediger and McDermott asked people whether they actually remembered hearing this unpresented word, or if they merely felt like they had heard it. Interestingly, participants often reported actually remembering hearing the word, illustrating memory for an event that never occurred.|$|R

40|$|In {{a special}} issue of the Journal of Memory and Lan-guage devoted to {{research}} on memory illusions, Roedi-ger (1996) provided a historical overview of errors in perception and memory. He defined a memory illusion as an instance in which a person’s report of a past event seriously deviates from the actual event. One striking ex-ample offered as evidence of a memory illusion was Deese’s (1959) finding of false recall in a list-learning paradigm. Deese presented subjects with lists of seman-tic associates to nonpresented critical words. For exam-ple, for the critical word needle, the presented list con-sisted of <b>thread,</b> pin, <b>eye,</b> sewing, sharp, point, pricked, thimble, haystack, pain, hurt, and injection. When the subjects were given a free recall test after each list’s pre-sentation, the nonpresented critical word was often erro-neously recalled more frequently than nonpresented but unrelated words. This procedure induced subjects to re-call specific words that were never presented in the lists.

This conclusion, {{which is based on}} new data reported by Miller and Wolford, overlooks the fact that Roediger and McDermott's false-memory account is as compatible with the new findings as the criterion-shift account is. Furthermore, a consideration of prior work concerned with investigating the conditions under which participants are and are not inclined to adjust the decision criterion suggests that the criterion-shift account of false memory is unlikely to be correct. Roediger and McDermott (1995) resurrected a procedure first used by Deese (1959) that seemed to reliably produce false memories of words. The procedure involves asking people to memorize items that are closely related to a critical item that did not appear on the list.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this design was to {{integrate}} techniques learned at workshops at the International Textiles and Apparel Association’s annual conferences. I wanted to combine the couture hand sewing technique that was used by Madame Gres in the 1930 s and new leather sewing techniques.

The beauty of the graves and the darkness of death was combined to create the overall look of the garment. Mimicking the alligator skin using the Madame Gres pleating technique was also critical to executing the design. Techniques: creating the front bodice shapes to mimic the alligator skin was a long and technical process. The size, placement, and angle of the pleated pieces was a tedious process. Each pleated piece was applied to a base garment. Once the pleated appliques were sewn on the base fabric it was carefully attached to the back leather bodice.

5000|$|A {{stitching}} awl {{is a tool}} {{with which}} holes can be punctured {{in a variety of}} materials, or existing holes can be enlarged. It is also used for sewing heavy materials, such as leather or canvas. It is a thin, tapered metal shaft, coming to a sharp point, either straight or slightly bent. These shafts are often in the form of interchangeable needles. They usually have an eye piercing at the pointed end to aid in drawing thread through holes for the purpose of manual lockstitch sewing, in which case it is also called a sewing awl. Stitching awls are frequently used by shoe repairers and other leatherworkers. Sewing awls are used to make lock stitches. The needle, with the <b>thread</b> in the <b>eye</b> is pushed through the material. The thread is then pulled through the eye to extend it. As the needle is pushed through the material, the extra thread from the first stitch is then threaded through the loops of successive stitches creating a lock stitch.

They are also used in the printing trades to aid in setting movable type and in bookbinding.|$|R

The rosy tints of the declining luminary were gilding the peaks and crags which lined the path, through which the horsemen wound slowly; and as these eternal battlements with which Nature had hemmed in the ravine which our travellers trod, blushed with the last tints of the fading sunlight, the valley below was gray and darkling, and the hard and devious course was sombre in twilight. A few goats, hardly visible among the peaks, were cropping the scanty herbage here and there. The pipes of shepherds, calling in their flocks as they trooped homewards to their mountain villages, sent up plaintive echoes which moaned through those rocky and lonely steeps; the stars began to glimmer in the purple heavens spread serenely overhead and the faint crescent of the moon, which had peered for some time scarce visible in the azure, gleamed out more brilliantly at every moment, until it blazed as if in triumph at the sun's retreat.

40|$|In Part I of the thesis, {{a general}} {{physical}} framework describing the kinetics of protein- DNA interaction is developed. Recognition and binding of specific sites on DNA by proteins is central for many cellular {{functions such as}} transcription, replication, and recombination. In the process of recognition, a protein rapidly searches for its specific site on a long DNA molecule and then strongly binds this site. Earlier {{studies have suggested that}} rapid search involves sliding of the protein along the DNA. I treat sliding as a one-dimensional diffusion in a sequence-dependent rough energy landscape. I demonstrate that, despite the landscape's roughness, rapid search can. be achieved if one-dimensional sliding is accompanied by three-dimensional diffusion. I estimate the range of the specific and nonspecific DNA-binding energy required for rapid search and suggest experiments that can test the proposed mechanism. It appears that realistic energy functions cannot provide both rapid search and strong binding of a rigid protein. To reconcile these two fundamental requirements, a search-and-fold mechanism is proposed that involves the coupling of protein binding and partial protein folding. In this regard, I propose an effective energy landscape that incorporates longitudinal (sliding) and transversal (folding) dynamics. I also study the influence of finite correlation length in the binding potential profile on the one-dimensional diffusion. The proposed mechanism has several important biological implications for search in the presence of other proteins and nucleosomes, simultaneous search by several proteins, etc. (cont.) In Part II, I analyze the behavior of random walks in presence of smooth manifolds. First, I treat a random walk (or gaussian polymer) confined to a half-space using a field-theoretic approach. Using path integrals, I derive basic scaling relations and the probability distribution function for arbitrary coupling strength between the polymer and the manifold. Next, I consider self-avoiding polymers attached to the tip of an impenetrable probe. The scaling exponents [gamma] ₁ and [gamma]₂, characterizing the number of configurations for the attachment of the polymer by one end, or at its midpoint, are shown to vary continuously with the tip's angle. These apex exponents are calculated analytically by [epsilon]-expansion and compared to numerical simulations in three dimensions. I find that when the polymer can move through the attachment point, it typically slides to one end; the apex exponents quantify the entropic barrier to <b>threading</b> the <b>eye</b> of the probe. by Michael Slutsky.

50|$|Power loom {{workers were}} usually girls and young women. They had the {{security}} of fixed hours, and except in times of hardship, {{such as in the}} cotton famine, regular income. They were paid a wage and a piece work bonus. Even when working in a combined mill, weavers stuck together and enjoyed a tight-knit community. The women usually minded the four machines and kept the looms oiled and clean. They were assisted by 'little tenters', children on a fixed wage who ran errands and did small tasks. They learnt the job of the weaver by watching. Often they would be half timers, carrying a green card which teacher and overlookers would sign to say they had turned up at the mill in the morning and in the afternoon at the school. At fourteen or so they come full-time into the mill, and started by sharing looms with an experienced worker where it was important to learn quickly as they would both be on piece work. Serious problems with the loom were left to the tackler to sort out. He would inevitably be a man, as were usually the overlookers. The mill had its health and safety issues, there was a reason why the women tied their hair back with scarves. Inhaling cotton dust caused lung problems, and the noise was causing total hearing loss.

40|$|U. S. {{campaign}} finance regulation {{is currently in}} bad shape. The combination of congressional inaction, regulatory ineffectiveness, and constitutional constraint perpetuates a status quo that no one intended and many deplore. Public financing for presidential elections is effectively dead, while Super PACs {{and other forms of}} independent spending are on the rise. The 501 (c) (4) nonprofit disclosure rules are very leaky, allowing corporations and others to conceal soft money contributions to Super PACs if they so choose. The Supreme Court has effectively precluded comprehensive {{campaign finance}} reform by its rulings, which have thrown out independent and personal expenditure bans, 1 limited public finance to opt-in schemes, 2 loosened the definition of issue ads, 3 and allowed corporations to use unlimited amounts of their treasury monies to fund independent campaigns. 4 To borrow from Vladimir Lenin, 2 ̆ 2 [W]hat is to be done? 2 ̆ 25 Professor Lawrence Lessig, in his Jorde Symposium Essay, What an Originalist Would Understand 2 ̆ 2 Corruption 2 ̆ 2 to Mean, believes the answer is to reframe the campaign finance problem as 2 ̆ 2 dependence corruption 2 ̆ 2 using originalist logic. Is he right? I have my doubts, as I will explain. In an effort to persuade the Court to reconsider its very narrow construction of permissible campaign finance reform, Professor Lessig is trying to <b>thread</b> the <b>eye</b> of a doctrinal needle. He wants to broaden the Buckley v. Valeo material corruption logic 6 but avoid the Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce equality rationale 7 that was overturned in Citizens United v. FEC. 8 This is a hard task that he makes even harder by embedding 2 ̆ 2 dependence corruption 2 ̆ 2 in an originalist argument. In this short commentary, I will examine the merits of this approach from a political science perspective and offer an alternative way to look at the same problem. Lessig 2 ̆ 7 s original-intent account rests on too many contestable counterfactual assumptions regarding what the Founders would have thought about conditions and political practices that they could not have imagined in their day. Moreover, the argument that the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s intent was only direct popular sovereignty ignores the Electoral College and U. S. Senate elections, which are based on geography. Nonetheless, I must leave it to constitutional scholars to determine whether his story is plausible enough to convince the Court. 9 My focus is on whether dependence corruption is the right principle for regulating campaign finance. As I will explain, I prefer to think that the problem is one of democratic distortion, and that the solution under the current constitutional constraints requires continuing efforts to open up donor participation to all voters, fix the broken disclosure system, and preserve the current system of congestion pricing. 1...|$|R

The effect was frustrated by the agile movements of the Huron, who had clothes to grasp by, and whose feet avoided the attempt with a nimbleness equal to that with which it was made. Then followed a sort of melee, if such a term {{can be applied to}} a struggle between two in which no efforts were strictly visible, the limbs and bodies of the combatants assuming so many attitudes and contortions as to defeat observation. This confused but fierce rally lasted less than a minute, however; when, Hurry, furious at having his strength baffled by the agility and nakedness of his foe, made a desperate effort, which sent the Huron from him, hurling his body violently against the logs of the hut. The concussion was so great as momentarily to confuse the latter's faculties. The pain, too, extorted a deep groan; an unusual concession to agony to escape a red man in the heat of battle. Still he rushed forward again to meet his enemy, conscious that his safety rested on it's resolution. Hurry now seized the other by the waist, raised him bodily from the platform, and fell with his own great weight on the form beneath. This additional shock so stunned the sufferer, that his gigantic white opponent now had him completely at his mercy. Passing his hands around the throat of his victim, he compressed them with the strength of a vice, fairly doubling the head of the Huron {{over the edge of the}} platform, until the chin was uppermost, with the infernal strength he expended. An instant sufficed to show the consequences. The eyes of the sufferer seemed to start forward, his tongue protruded, and his nostrils dilated nearly to splitting. At this instant a rope of bark, having an eye, was passed dexterously within the two arms of Hurry, the end <b>threaded</b> the <b>eye,</b> forming a noose, and his elbows were drawn together behind his back, with a power that all his gigantic strength could not resist. Reluctantly, even under such circumstances, did the exasperated borderer see his hands drawn from their deadly grasp, for all the evil passions were then in the ascendant. Almost at the same instant a similar fastening secured his ankles, and his body was rolled to the centre of the platform as helplessly, and as cavalierly, as if it were a log of wood. His rescued antagonist, however, did not rise, for while he began again to breathe, his head still hung helplessly over the edge of the logs, and it was thought at first that his neck was dislocated. He recovered gradually only, and it was hours before he could walk. Some fancied that neither his body, nor his mind, ever totally recovered from this near approach to death.|$|R

Through my childhood and developmental years, I looked {{to her for}} guidance and support through nearly every aspect in my life. Rebellious Elegance represents a strong-willed, young-hearted, spontaneous woman who thrives on the adventure of living life to the fullest and conquering anything that stands in her way. This {{made me think of}} black swans. They stand {{out in the middle of}} a flock of white swans because of their natural born characteristics of being visually attractive, confident, and having a mind of their own. Process: Initially I started sketching designs that I have always imagined my sister wearing. Being the older sister, I always felt that she was a bit more risqué and daring in her choices. Therefore, I created the dress with triangle shaped cutouts on the side panels of the princess seam dress. I knew that I wanted her dress to resemble a black swan and after researching photographs and artwork of black swans, gowns, and trend forecasts, I came up with a flouncy yet fitted silhouette. My sister’s personality is integrated into the overall design of the dress with its open side panels, low back, fitted bodice, and high leg slit. Techniques: The dress was created through the draping technique, which is a method of constructing a garment through arranging fabric on a mannequin using the natural hang or fall of to get a desired look. Once draped and trued, a pattern was made. Next I constructed a sample and fit the sample on my model. I made the necessary alterations to my pattern from the fitting and created the final fully lined garment. To finish off the design I added a satin ribbon detail around the neckline and back bodice edge.

40|$|Transverse aortic {{constriction}} (TAC) in mice {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used surgical techniques for experimental investigation of pressure overload-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and its progression to heart failure. In the majority of the reported investigations, this procedure is performed with intubation and ventilation of the animal which renders it demanding and time-consuming and adds to the surgical burden to the animal. The aim of this protocol is to describe a simplified technique of minimally invasive TAC without intubation and ventilation of mice. Critical steps of the technique are emphasized in order to achieve low mortality and high efficiency in inducing LVH. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice (10 -week-old, 25 - 30 g, n= 60) were anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine. In a spontaneously breathing animal following a 3 - 4 mm upper partial sternotomy, a segment of 6 / 0 silk suture <b>threaded</b> through the <b>eye</b> of a ligation aid was passed under the aortic arch and tied over a blunted 27 -gauge needle. Sham-operated animals underwent the same surgical preparation but without aortic constriction. The efficacy of the procedure in inducing LVH is attested by a significant increase in the heart/body weight ratio. This ratio is obtained at days 3, 7, 14 and 28 after surgery (n = 6 - 10 in each group and each time point). Using our technique, LVH is observed in TAC compared to sham animals from day 7 through day 28. Operative and late (over 28 days) mortalities are both very low at 1. 7 %. In conclusion, our cost-effective technique of minimally invasive TAC in mice carries very low operative and post-operative mortalities and is highly efficient in inducing LVH. It simplifies the operative procedure and reduces the strain put on the animal. It can be easily performed by following the critical steps described in this protocol...|$|R

There was Deacon Dundas, a great wagon load of an old gentleman, whose ample pockets looked as if they might have held half the congregation, who used to establish himself just on one side of me, and seemed to feel such entire confidence in the soundness and capacity of his pastor that he could sleep very comfortably from one end of the sermon to the other. Occasionally, to be sure, one of your officious blue flies, who, as every body knows, are amazingly particular about such matters, would buzz into his mouth, or flirt into his ears a passing admonition as to the impropriety of sleeping in meeting, when the good old gentleman would start, open his eyes very wide, and look about with a resolute air, as much as to say, [...] "I wasn't asleep, I can tell you;" [...] and then setting himself in an edifying posture of attention, you might perceive his head gradually settling back, his mouth slowly opening wider and wider, till the good man would go off again soundly asleep, as if nothing had happened.|$|R
