5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began {{to believe that the}} fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined <b>the</b> <b>pond,</b> but the fish survived. They raked <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.|$|E

5|$|An air well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dew pond. A dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock.

40|$|The {{thousands}} of agricultural <b>ponds</b> in <b>the</b> Taoyuan plateau were developed for farmland irrigation adjustment by early inhabitants.

5|$|Research by Jennifer A. Clack and {{her colleagues}} showed that the very {{earliest}} tetrapods, animals similar to Acanthostega, were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land.

40|$|A {{study was}} made on four {{environmental}} ponds in Sölvesborgs municipality. The reason for this was to see if <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> had fulfilled {{some of the questions}} that was mentioned in the project “Rädda Hanöbukten”. The questions were as following; do <b>the</b> environmental <b>ponds</b> decrease <b>the</b> leakage of nitrogen and phosphorus into Hanöbukten, do <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> decrease <b>the</b> use of groundwater in Sölvesborgs Municipality and are there any restrictions on what the water in <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> is allowed to be used for. In order to answer these questions a questionnaire was made and interviews were held. Also data from 19 different test sites around Sölvesborg were analysed. Discussions were held concerning how well <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> worked as a trap for nitrogen and phosphorus. Possible connections between the soil, the surrounding environment, precipitation and the collected data were studied. In the questionnaire and in the interviews it was asked if there existed any restrictions on how to use the water from <b>the</b> <b>ponds.</b> <b>The</b> last point that was examined was if <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> had managed to decrease the use of groundwater in Sölvesborg municipality. The results showed that there were no restrictions on how to use the water from <b>the</b> <b>ponds.</b> It also showed that <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> had not decreased the use of groundwater significantly, but that they had hindered an increase in the use of groundwater. Furthermore the results showed that <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> worked well as a trap for nitrogen and phosphorous but how large the effects were could not be seen in the results...|$|R

5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement.

5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings.

But if <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

Nancy sleeps with Rick again although the next morning she has regrets. On the night of her hen do, Nancy is attacked by Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) following an argument, and he attempts to rape her while wearing a mask. However, she is saved by Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill), and Darren and Nancy get remarried anyway. Finn is arrested and Darren stands by Nancy in court, however due to the DNA tests, Nancy is forced to admit her affair and that she slept with Rick within 24 hours before the attack. This creates more strife between Darren and Nancy; Darren sleeps with Sienna.
