5|$|The {{membership}} decline {{continued in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and dwindled {{to the point where}} the congregation could no longer afford <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary, and thought they would have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and prozdor (high school).|$|E

40|$|The Thermal Enhanced Vapor Extraction System (TEVES), which {{combines}} powerline frequency heating (PLF) and radio frequency (RF) heating with vacuum soil vapor extraction, {{was used to}} effectively remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) from a pit in the chemical waste landfill (CWL) at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) within a two month heating period. Volume average temperatures of 83 {degrees}C and 112 {degrees}C were reached for the PLF and RF heating periods, respectively, within the 15 ft x 45 ft x 18. 5 ft deep treated volume. This resulted in the removal of 243 lb of measured toxic organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs), 55 gallons of oil, and 11, 000 gallons {{of water from the}} site. Reductions of up to 99 % in total chromatographic organics (TCO) was achieved in <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> zone. Energy balance calculations for <b>the</b> PLF <b>heating</b> period showed that 36. 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> added went <b>to</b> <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> soil, 38. 5 % went to evaporating water and organics, 4. 2 % went <b>to</b> sensible <b>heat</b> in <b>the</b> water, 7. 1 % went <b>to</b> <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> extracted air, and 6. 6 % was lost.

Energy balance closure was 92. 8 % for <b>the</b> PLF <b>heating</b> and 98 % for <b>the</b> RF <b>heating.</b> <b>The</b> energy input requirement per unit soil volume heated per unit temperature increase was 1. 63 kWH/yd{sup 3 }-{degrees}C for PLF heating and 0. 73 kWH/yd{sup 3 }{degrees}C for RF heating...|$|R
5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected <b>to</b> <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed <b>to</b> <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E

5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the past were used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|E

During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall hosted 16 ice hockey matches between 12 and 26 February, {{including}} two quarter-finals and one semi-final. The remaining matches were played at the larger Håkons Hall in Lillehammer. In March 1995, the operator announced that the ice would remain throughout the year. Because of the natural cooling of the mountain, the operator saved 1,000 kilowatts in heating costs by reusing the cooling system <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> rest of the cavern hall. On 4 April 1995, the venue was used to host an international match between Norway and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} heat pump in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} {{the idea of}} using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912. But {{it was not until the}} late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, {{the turret}} {{layout of the}} Delawares was also retained, with its {{respective}} challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, {{was placed on the}} main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E

5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> factory with engine exhaust.|$|E
25|$|Seawater {{is pumped}} into an evaporator, {{where it is}} boiled by a heating coil. Vapour {{produced}} is then compressed, raising its temperature.

To start the cycle, an electric pre-heater is used <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> first water supply.
