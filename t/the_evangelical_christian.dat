25|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, many Restoration Movement churches not {{affiliated}} with the three larger Restoration bodies existed under such names as Canadian Evangelical Christian Churches, Evangelical Christian Churches, Independent Christian Churches, Christian Churches of North America, Christian Missionary Churches, Bible Evangelical Churches, Community Churches, Evangelical Congregational Churches, Congregational Christian Churches, and the Evangelical Protestant Churches which traces its roots to various Lutheran and Reformed churches from Germany in 1720. The Congregation Christian Church itself {{was the product of}} a merger in 1931, between the Congregational Church and a number of Christian Churches. The Congregational Church developed in England before migrating to the United States. Some of these united in 1966 as <b>the</b> <b>Evangelical</b> <b>Christian</b> Churches, Farmland, Indiana.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Evangelical</b> <b>Christian</b> Church (Christian Disciples) in Canada is non-denominational and {{its member}} churches are self-governing in the {{tradition}} of congregational polity. Ministers who are the Elders of the church are held accountable only to the scriptures, and guaranteed freedom of thought and conscience to practice their faith without doctrinal restrictions. The ECC maintains a high commitment to religious freedom, Christian , and the priesthood of all believers who make up the body of Christ. The ECC permits only those practices that it believes are found in the guidelines of New Testament living and worship as taught by the early church. The ECC divides the country into 10 districts assigned to district superintendents for liaison with the congregations and ministers in the appointed province. A hierarchical leadership is in place nationally, including the provincial superintendents, the general minister, the board of directors or general council, and regional field representatives.

50|$|From <b>the</b> 1920s, <b>Evangelical</b> <b>Christians</b> and Baptists were {{prohibited}} in Soviet Ukraine. To some extent, {{they were}} revived {{during and after}} World War II.

The oldest Christian Disciples Church in Canada was founded in 1810 by John R. Stewart, an immigrant from Perthshire, Scotland. The first Meeting House was a log cabin built in 1813. From 1907 to 1947, the church was operated as a Baptist charge in conjunction with Scottish Baptist churches in Alexandra and Hazelbrook, when it apparently again became an Evangelical Christian Church. After the Second World War, a collaboration between an All-Canadian and North American (Evangelical Christian Church) Movement began {{as a way to}} coordinate and unite the various churches of the Restoration Movement in order to reform the church along non-sectarian, non-creedal lines. Several church bodies identifying with the Stone-Campbell movement were very creedal and range from ultra-conservative to ultra-liberal {{as can be seen in}} the United Church of Christ which is an attempt to unite all Christian denominations into one national body. In the beginning of the early 1940s, this movement organized a Great Western revival meeting, causing an increase in religious interest and excitement in the Canadian Evangelical Christian Church, unifying Christians based on their interpretations of New Testament principles.|$|E
500|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? {{was named}} Book of the Year by <b>the</b> <b>Evangelical</b> <b>Christian</b> Publishers Association in 1998 {{when it was}} chosen by Christian {{retailers}} as the title they most enjoyed selling; Yancey's The Jesus I Never Knew had received the same award two years earlier. In 1998, Christianity Today compared What's So Amazing About Grace? to Joel A. Carpenter's Revive Us Again, writing that both books productively analyze Christian fundamentalism. That year, Karla Vallance's Christian Science Monitor review called the book similarly sentimental to John Newton's hymn [...] "Amazing Grace".|$|E
500|$|The campaign's {{strategy}} {{called for}} winning the initial two contests– the January 3, 2008, Iowa Republican caucuses and the adjacent-to-his-home-state January 8 New Hampshire primary– and propelling Romney nationally. However, he took second place in both, losing Iowa to a vastly outspent Huckabee who received more than twice <b>the</b> <b>evangelical</b> <b>Christian</b> votes, and losing New Hampshire to the resurgent McCain. Huckabee and McCain criticized Romney's image as a flip flopper and this label would stick to Romney through the campaign (one that Romney rejected as unfair and inaccurate, except for his acknowledged change of mind on abortion). Romney seemed to approach the campaign as a management consulting exercise, and showed a lack of personal warmth and political feel; journalist Evan Thomas wrote that Romney [...] "came off as a phony, {{even when he was}} perfectly sincere." [...] The fervor with which Romney adopted his new stances and attitudes contributed to the perception of inauthenticity that hampered the campaign. Romney's staff would conclude that competing as a candidate of social conservatism and ideological purity rather than of pragmatic competence had been a mistake.|$|E

5000|$|In 1939, despite {{differences}} in dogma and worship, the National Renaissance Front regime compelled the Christians of the Scriptures {{to merge with}} <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Evangelicals,</b> resulting in <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Evangelical</b> Church. <b>The</b> resultant church had two branches: branch I, which practised believer's baptism, and the Tudorite branch II, which employed infant baptism.
