5|$|Talented slaves with a {{knack for}} {{business}} might accumulate a large enough peculium to justify <b>their</b> <b>freedom,</b> or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (Lex Fufia Caninia) limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.|$|E

The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort. By the early 1930s, censorship in the United States was diminishing.|$|E
5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence. Those paying Jizya were subjected to insults and humiliation by the tax collectors. Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> if they converted to Islam.|$|E

Also, they feel shameful because they notice the unhappy expressions that are on their parent's faces.|$|R
5|$|After {{the final}} battle, which {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory and in Petar Kružić's death, the Klis defenders, who were lacking in water supplies, finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> on 12 March 1537. Citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated {{to the city of}} Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army. Klis became an administrative centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet, and would remain so for a century.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund and Andrew were reconciled, and Sigismund renounced Transylvania {{in favor}} of Andrew in March 1599. Andrew was {{supported}} by Poland and the Ottoman Empire. Rudolph II persuaded Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, to invade Transylvania. Michael defeated Andrew's troops at the Battle of Sellenberk {{with the assistance of}} Székely commoners, to whom he had promised to restore <b>their</b> <b>freedom.</b> Andrew wanted to flee to Poland, but Székely serfs captured and killed him.|$|E
5|$|Slaves in Toraja society were family property. Sometimes Torajans {{decided to}} become slaves when they {{incurred}} a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Slaves could buy <b>their</b> <b>freedom,</b> but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime punishable by death.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine {{sources have}} not {{recorded}} {{the aftermath of}} the battle but, according to the accounts of the contemporary Arab historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, the Bulgarians marched towards Constantinople. Leo VI was in such a panic that he considered arming Arab prisoners of war and sending them against the Bulgarians in return for <b>their</b> <b>freedom,</b> but eventually abandoned the idea. Further negotiations followed until the Byzantines agreed to the Bulgarian demands.|$|E

5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{operation}} was mounted too late to prevent the attacks on Saigon, the Australians and New Zealanders successfully disrupted the communist lines of communication, limiting <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> of manoeuvre to attack the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex, while they were also able to successfully interdict their withdrawal, causing heavy casualties. The operation was also significant {{as it was the}} first deployment of 1 ATF outside its Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR) in Phuoc Tuy, and in this it set a precedent for later operations outside the province. Meanwhile, the remaining Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy Province also successfully repelled repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien, as part of the Tet Offensive that had engulfed population centres across South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{believed}} in the abolition of slavery, inspired not only on written works by Victor Schoelcher, John Brown, Lamartine and Tapia, but also on personal experience, {{based on what he}} saw at his father's farm and in daily Puerto Rican life. Based on his beliefs, he founded a civic organization in 1856, one of many others that were later called the Secret Abolitionist Societies by historians. Little is known about them due to their clandestine nature, but Betances and Salvador Brau (a close friend who later became the official Historian of Puerto Rico) describe them in their writings. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries where slavery had been abolished already; other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out <b>their</b> <b>freedom.</b>|$|E

5|$|Galland {{was summoned}} to Karinhall on 18 August 1940, and missed the intense air battle that day, known as The Hardest Day. During the meeting, Göring insisted that, in combat, Bf 109 fighters escort Bf 110s, which could not survive against {{single-engine}} fighters. As high-scoring aces, both Galland and Mölders shared their concerns that close escort of Bf 110s and bombers robbed fighter pilots of <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> to roam and engage the enemy on their own terms. They also pointed {{to the fact that}} German bombers flew at medium altitudes and low speed, the best height area and speed for the manoeuvrability of the Spitfire. Galland resented his pilots having to carry out a task unsuited to their equipment but Göring would not move from his position.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than <b>their</b> <b>freedom.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 344BC Demosthenes {{travelled}} to the Peloponnese, {{in order}} to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence, but his efforts were generally unsuccessful. Most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> and sent a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances against Demosthenes' activities. In response, Demosthenes delivered the Second Philippic, a vehement attack against Philip. In 343BC Demosthenes delivered On the False Embassy against Aeschines, who was facing a charge of high treason. Nonetheless, Aeschines was acquitted by the narrow margin of thirty votes by a jury which may have numbered as many as 1,501.* D. M. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator, ch. 12 (in fine).|$|E
5|$|Junayd {{used the}} {{diversion}} {{to break through}} to Samarkand, but as his army exited the defile, his officers persuaded him to make camp and spend the night there instead of making for the city. The advice proved sound, as the Turgesh caught up with them and would likely have annihilated Junayd's army on open ground. As it was, the camp's fortifications could not be completed before the next day, when the Turgesh renewed their attack. At this point, the Arabs were so hard-pressed that Junayd even promised the army's slaves <b>their</b> <b>freedom</b> if they would fight. Many did so, using saddle blankets as armour. The Turgesh attacks were repelled, and despite its heavy casualties the Umayyad army reached Samarkand after almost three days of battle.|$|E
