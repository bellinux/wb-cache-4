5|$|Back at home, Quisling was {{now less}} {{concerned}} about Nasjonal Samling's membership and even wanted action {{to clean up the}} membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to accept his government.|$|E
5|$|Fall Out Boy is an American {{rock band}} formed in Wilmette, Illinois, {{a suburb of}} Chicago, in 2001. The band {{consists}} of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording the group's debut album, <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> to Your Grave (2003). The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, {{as well as some}} moderate commercial success. <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> to Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their <b>take.</b> <b>This,</b> along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840 presidential election, Crittenden again {{encouraged}} Kentucky Whigs {{to support}} the nomination of Henry Clay. After Clay lost the nomination, Crittenden supported eventual victor William Henry Harrison. Crittenden was re-elected to the Senate in 1840 {{even though he was}} widely expected to be named to a position in Harrison's presidential cabinet. He was apparently given his choice of cabinet positions, and chose that of Attorney General. He resigned his Senate seat to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> post.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some <b>take</b> <b>this</b> reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E

Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also <b>take</b> <b>this</b> species when the opportunity arises. However, there is little direct {{evidence to show that}} either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids, such as the European magpie or Eurasian jay, decrease population numbers.|$|E

Andy hesitates to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> privilege away from Emily but is forced to accept the offer after being told by Miranda that she will lose her job if she declines. Andy tries to tell Emily on her way to work. However, Emily is hit by a car and Andy has to break the bad news while visiting Emily in the hospital.|$|E

5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> one step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E

Subsequently, a poll was posted on the 2K Games operated Cult of Rapture community website in which visitors could vote on what features they would most like to see in a special edition; the company stated that developers would <b>take</b> <b>this</b> poll into serious consideration. To determine what artwork would be used for the Limited Edition cover, 2K Games ran a contest, with the winning entry provided by Crystal Clear Art's owner and graphic designer Adam Meyer.|$|E
5|$|He reprised {{his voice}} role in Kung Fu Panda2, {{as well as}} {{produced}} and took a supporting role in 50/50, from Mandate Pictures. The dramedy about cancer {{was based on an}} autobiographical script by screenwriter Will Reiser, and was released in September 2011. In mid-2010, Rogen shot scenes for another upcoming film, <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> Waltz, with Michelle Williams. Another of his movies, Paramount Pictures's road movie The Guilt Trip, also starring Barbra Streisand, was released in cinemas in 2012. The film was about an inventor (Rogen) who invites his mother (Streisand) on a road trip, as he attempts to sell his new product while also reuniting her with a lost love. In 2013, Rogen along with screenwriting collaborator Evan Goldberg made their directorial debut with This Is the End, a comedy movie featuring Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride playing fictional versions of themselves facing a global apocalypse. The film received positive reviews and was number two in the box office on its opening weekend.|$|E
5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side to <b>take.</b> <b>This</b> argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
