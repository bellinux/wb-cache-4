5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E

Bond suspects that the Resident Director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as persona non grata.|$|E

Watts reveals that a vaccine has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; Watts and Black have already been inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells Watts to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, as he hopes to keep them safe in the cabin until the crisis resolves.|$|E

50|$|The theory {{continues}} that Japanese-Soviet relations, and Japanese-Russian relations {{before and}} after the existence of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>have</b> been in some ways secretive and mysterious. For instance, as early as 1925 Japan and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>had</b> secret bilateral fishing rights agreements, with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> giving up much of its fishing rights to Japan with no obvious motive or explanation.|$|R

25|$|The current ethnic {{background}} {{of the people of}} Trabzon is mostly Turkish. There are also descendants of Circassian muhajiris in the city, as well as smaller number of Laz people, Muslim Greeks (Romeyka-speakers) and Armenians (Hemshin). Local Turks are mostly of Chepni Turkmen origin. The main language of these ethnic groups is Turkish.

25|$|An Estonian oil {{syndicate}} {{became a}} joint Estonian-Soviet enterprise in 1928 and Päts {{was hired by}} it as a legal consultant in 1930.

The purpose of the joint enterprise for the Soviets was not supposed to be business-related, but only to attract Päts. This official salary by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> thus been seen as the salary for his long-term cooperation with the Soviets.

Energy Minister Mikhail Sergetov, a non-voting candidate member of the Politburo, suggests making concessions with the West to survive the crisis. He is overruled by the Defense Minister, KGB Chairman Boris Georgiyevich Kosov and the Foreign Minister, who, fearing that the west would {{take advantage of the}} Soviet Union's weakened state to permanently cripple it, instead approve a plan to seize the oil fields in the Persian Gulf by military force. Sergetov reluctantly agrees, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> sufficient oil reserves for the war in order to gain political favor.

25|$|Recent {{historical}} {{scholarship has}} shed {{new light on}} the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> caused a revision of estimates of Soviet WW2 fatalities. According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million. including 8.5 million due to war related famine and disease In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million. Historian Rüdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 that estimated the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe. The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million, while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million.|$|E
25|$|The First Main Directorate (or First Chief Directorate, Russian: Первое главное управление, Pervoye glavnoye upravleniye) of the Committee for State Security of the USSR (PGU KGB) was the {{organization}} responsible for foreign operations and intelligence activities by {{providing for the}} training and management of covert agents, intelligence collection administration, and the acquisition of foreign and domestic political, scientific and technical intelligence in the Soviet Union. The First Chief Directorate was formed within the KGB directorate in 1954, and {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union was renamed as the Central Intelligence Service and finally the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR RF).
