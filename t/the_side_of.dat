5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the carriage.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Washington Masonic National Memorial is a mural by Allyn Cox {{depicting}} Washington {{laying the}} cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{outermost}} triangle {{represent the}} shortest ways of moving a tower from one peg to another one. The edge in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest triangle represents a move {{of the largest}} disk. The edge in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> each next smaller triangle represents a move of each next smaller disk. <b>The</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest triangles represent moves of the smallest disk.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male pelvis {{converge}} {{from the}} inlet to the outlet, whereas <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female pelvis are wider apart.|$|R
5000|$|Sixth Type—the {{shape of}} the recoil spring channel was changed, and <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slide were {{extended}} so they overlapped <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame.|$|R
5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced up <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air up <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer {{air on the}} descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
5|$|School Farmhouse, in School Lane, {{dates from}} the late 17th century and has a studded oak door in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{brick wall}} around the {{platform}} is in a considerably preserved state as well, although parts of it have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the lower platform.|$|E
25|$|Flaunches, flanches or flasks are regions on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, {{bounded by}} a pair of {{circular}} arcs whose centers are beyond <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shield.|$|R
50|$|East Baltimore Midway is a {{neighborhood}} in the Eastern district of Baltimore, Maryland. Its boundaries are <b>the</b> south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> 25th Street, <b>the</b> east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Greenmount Avenue, <b>the</b> west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Harford Road, and <b>the</b> north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> North Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|The tangent {{lines of}} the nine-point circle at <b>the</b> {{midpoints}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> [...] are parallel to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthic triangle, forming a triangle similar to the orthic triangle.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} eight 7-inch 45-caliber {{guns were}} distributed four per side, in casemates on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the ship, below the main deck.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near Blackbird canyon in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.|$|E
5|$|After the {{beginning}} of Bulgaria's engagement in First World War on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Central Powers in autumn 1915, many ethnic Albanians joined the Bulgarians who gave them weapons.

25|$|The ancient Babylonians {{had known}} of theorems on <b>the</b> ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> similar triangles for many centuries, but they lacked {{the concept of}} an angle measure and consequently, studied <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> triangles instead.|$|R
5|$|Albion players – {{along with}} those of other Football League teams – first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the {{abandoned}} season of 1939–40, and names on the back of their shirts from 1999–2000. Red numbers were added to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Albion players' shorts in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} left of the Bastille except some remains of its stone {{foundation}} that were relocated to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and political control during the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Before her death, Plath tried {{several times}} to take her own life. On August 24, 1953, Plath overdosed on pills in the cellar of her mother's home.

50|$|The {{park has}} seven main entrances. Gate 1 {{is located on}} <b>the</b> South <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park in right field, Gate 2 is located on <b>the</b> Southwest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park down the right field line, Gate 3 is located on <b>the</b> West <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park on <b>the</b> 1st base <b>side,</b> Gate 4 is on <b>the</b> Northwest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park behind home plate, Gate 5 is located on <b>the</b> North <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park on <b>the</b> 3rd base <b>side,</b> Gate 6 is located on <b>the</b> Northeast <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park down the left field line and Gate 7 is located on <b>the</b> East <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park in left field.|$|R
50|$|At 101 Street, {{the road}} again changes names to 103A Avenue, it then passes on <b>the</b> south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CN Tower, <b>the</b> north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Edmonton City Hall, <b>the</b> south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Edmonton Police Headquarters, and <b>the</b> north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Chinatown.

50|$|If {{there is}} a defect in the septum, it is {{possible}} for blood to travel from <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart to <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart, or the other way around. Since <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart contains venous blood with a low oxygen content, and <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart contains arterial blood with a high oxygen content, it is beneficial to prevent any communication between <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart and prevent the blood from <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart from mixing with each other.|$|R
5|$|Brock's {{childhood}} home on High Street, St Peter Port, Guernsey still stands, and is {{marked with a}} memorial plaque. A memorial, paid for by Canada, is fitted into <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Town Church, the parish church of St Peter Port.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by plucking. The basin became deeper (especially {{at the base of the}} headwall) as it continued to be eroded by abrasion.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{have shown}} {{evidence}} of a 12th-century masonry building {{on the top of}} the hill, which may be from the probable adulterine castle. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mound may have been terraced for agricultural use due to much of the surrounding land flooded on a regular basis during the medieval period.|$|E
5000|$|To {{overcome}} the steep climb (796 metres between Innsbruck and Brenner) two spiral tunnels were built, using <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a valley at St. Jodok on <b>the</b> Austrian <b>side</b> and <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pflerschtal (German for [...] "Pflersch Valley") on <b>the</b> Italian <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{lines are}} drawn through the Lemoine point {{parallel}} to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a triangle, then the six points of {{intersection of the}} lines and <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle are concyclic, in {{what is called the}} Lemoine circle.|$|R
