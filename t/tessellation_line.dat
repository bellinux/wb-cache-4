50|$|Line and hyper-flat {{processes}} {{have their}} own direct applications, but also find application as one way of creating tessellations dividing space; hence for example one may speak of Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellations.</b> A notable recent result proves that the cell at {{the origin of the}} Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellation</b> is approximately circular when conditioned to be large. Tessellations in stochastic geometry can of course be produced by other means, for example by using Voronoi and variant constructions, and also by iterating various means of construction.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a family of}} random <b>line</b> <b>tessellations</b> of the Euclidean plane introduced {{in a much more}} formal context by Hug and Schneider [Geom. Funct. Anal. 17, 156 (2007) ] and described by a parameter α≥ 1. For α= 1 the zero-cell (that is, the cell containing the origin) coincides with the Crofton cell of a Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellation,</b> and for α= 2 it coincides with the typical Poisson-Voronoi cell. Let p_n(α) be the probability for the zero-cell to have n sides. By the methods of statistical mechanics we construct the asymptotic expansion of p_n(α) up to terms that vanish as n→∞. In the large-n limit the cell is shown to become circular. The circle is centered at the origin when α> 1, but gets delocalized for the Crofton cell, α= 1, which is a singular point of the parameter range. The large-n expansion of p_n(1) is therefore {{different from that of the}} general case and we show how to carry it out. As a corollary we obtain the analogous expansion for the typical n-sided cell of a Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellation.</b> Comment: 26 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{points at}} the centers of the squares, where four fish meet at their fins, form the {{vertices}} of an order-8 triangular tiling, while the points where three fish fins meet and the points where three white lines cross together form the vertices of its dual, the octagonal tiling. Similar <b>tessellations</b> by <b>lines</b> of fish may be constructed for other hyperbolic tilings formed by polygons other than triangles and squares, or with more than three white curves at each crossing.|$|R

In this paper, differences in the arrangement of the cells in these two tessellation models are investigated. In particular, characteristics of the set of cells neighbouring the typical cell are studied. Furthermore, the pair-correlation function and several mark correlation functions of the point processes of cell centres are estimated and compared...|$|R

40|$|A {{stationary}} Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellation</b> {{is considered}} whose directional distribution is concentrated {{on two different}} atoms with some positive weights. The shape of the typical cell of such a tessellation is studied when its area or its perimeter tends to zero. In contrast to known results where the area or the perimeter tends to infinity, it is shown that the asymptotic shape of cells having small area is degenerate. Again {{in contrast to the}} case of large cells, the asymptotic shape of cells with small perimeter is not uniquely determined. The results are accompanied by a large scale simulation study...|$|R
40|$|A {{tessellation}} {{which is}} capable of producing rough boundaries is proposed. Some properties of the proposed tessellation are also described. Key words: tessellation, stochastic growth, roughness 1. Introduction The work described below is motivated by complex images such as that in Fig. 1, which displays grains in rolled aluminium, viewed through polarized light. Statistical analysis of grain characteristics (eg. size, shape) first requires segmentation of the grains. In order to compare quantitatively the performance of different segmentation techniques, {{it is useful to}} develop and analyse models which mimic the important characteristics of real images, such as that in Fig. 1. In this paper, we describe a tessellation which attempts to mimic those shape characteristics. One observation about the grains is that they have rough boundaries. Therefore common tessellations such as the Voronoi, Delaunay and Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellations</b> (see [9]) are inappropriate for our purpose, as they h [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We observe {{stationary}} random tessellations X = {n}n≥ 1 in Rd through a convex sampling window W that expands unboundedly and we determine the total (k − 1) -volume of those (k − 1) -dimensional manifold processes which are induced on the k-facets of X (1 ≤ k ≤ d − 1) by their intersections with the (d − 1) -facets of independent and identically distributed motion-invariant tessellations Xn generated within each cell n of X. The cases of X being either a Poisson hyperplane tessellation or a random tessellation with weak dependences are treated separately. In both cases, however, we obtain {{that all of}} the total volumes measured in W are approximately normally distributed when W is sufficiently large. Structural formulae for mean values and asymptotic variances are derived and explicit numerical values are given for planar Poisson–Voronoi tessellations (PVTs) and Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellations</b> (PLTs) ...|$|R
40|$|The Voronoi {{tessellation}} in {{the plane}} can be computed in a particularly time-efficient manner for generators with integer coordinates, such as typically acquired from a raster image. The Voronoi <b>tessellation</b> is constructed <b>line</b> by line during a single scan of the input image, simultaneously generating an edge-list data structure (DCEL) suitable for postprocessing by graph traversal algorithms. In contrast to the generic case, it can be shown that the topology of the grid permits the algorithm to run faster on complex scenes. Consequently, in Computer Vision applications, the computation of the Voronoi tessellation represents an attractive alternative to rasterbased techniques {{in terms of both}} computational complexity and quality of data structures.

40|$|The point {{process of}} {{vertices}} of an iteration infinitely divisible or more specifically of an iteration stable random tessellation in the Euclidean plane is considered. We explicitly determine its covariance measure and its pair-correlation function {{as well as}} the cross-covariance measure and the cross-pair-correlation function of the vertex point process and the random length measure in general non-stationary regime, and we specialize it to the stationary and isotropic setting. Exact formulas are given for vertex count variances in compact and convex sampling windows and asymptotic relations are derived. Our results are then compared with those for a Poisson <b>line</b> <b>tessellation</b> having the same length density parameter. Moreover, a functional central limit theorem for the joint process of suitably rescaled total edge count and edge length is established with the process (ξ,tξ), t> 0, arising in the limit, where ξ is a centered Gaussian variable with explicitly known variance.

40|$|This paper {{combines}} the stochastic-model-based {{reconstruction of the}} gas diffusion layer (GDL) of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and direct simulation to investigate the pore-level transport within GDLs. The carbon-paper-based GDL is modeled as a stack of thin sections with each section described by planar 2 -dimensional random <b>line</b> <b>tessellations</b> which are further dilated to three dimensions. The reconstruction is based on given GDL data provided by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. With the constructed GDL, we further introduce the direct simulation of the coupled transport processes inside the GDL. The simulation considers the gas flow and species transport in the void space, electronic current conduction in the solid, and heat transfer in both phases. Results indicate a remarkable distinction in tortuosities of gas diffusion passage and solid matrix across the GDL with the former ~ 1. 2 and the latter ~ 13. 8. This difference arises from the synthetic microstructure of GDL, i. e. the lateral alignment nature of the thin carbon fiber, allowing the solid-phase transport to occur mostly in lateral direction. Extensive discussion on the tortuosity is also presented. The numerical tool {{can be applied to}} investigate the impact of the GDL microstructure on pore-level transport and scrutinize the macroscopic approach vastly adopted in current fuel cell modeling...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented which {{makes use of}} three-dimensional Voronoi tessellations to track up to 20 tracers using a PET scanner. The lines of response generated by the PET scanner are discretized into sets of equidistant points, and these are used as the input seeds to the Voronoi <b>tessellation.</b> For each <b>line</b> of response, the point with the smallest Voronoi region is located; this point {{is assumed to be}} the origin of the corresponding line of response. Once these origin points have been determined, any outliers are removed, and the remaining points are clustered using the DBSCAN algorithm. The centroid of each cluster is classified as a tracer location. Once the tracer locations are determined for each time frame in the experimental data set, a custom multiple target tracking {{algorithm is}} used to associate identical tracers from frame to frame. Since there are no physical properties to distinguish the tracers from one another, the tracking algorithm uses velocity and position to extrapolate the locations of existing tracers and match the next frame's tracers to the trajectories. A series of experiments were conducted in order to test the robustness, accuracy and computational performance of the algorithm. A measure of robustness is the chance of track loss, which occurs when the algorithm fails to match a tracer location with its trajectory, and the track is terminated. The chance of track loss increases with the number of tracers; the acceleration of the tracers; the time interval between successive frames; and the proximity of tracers to each other. In the case of two tracers colliding, the two tracks merge {{for a short period of}} time, before separating and become distinguishable again. Track loss also occurs when a tracer leaves the field of view of the scanner; on return it is treated as a new object. The accuracy of location of the algorithm was found to be slightly affected by tracer velocity, but is much more dependent on the distance between consecutive points on a line of response, and the number of lines of response used per time frame. A single tracer was located to within 1. 26 mm. This was compared to the widely accepted Birmingham algorithm, which located the same tracer to within 0. 92 mm. Precisions of between 1. 5 and 2. 0 mm were easily achieved for multiple tracers. The memory usage and processing time of the algorithm are dependent on the number of tracers used in the experiment. It was found that the processing time per frame for 20 tracers was about 15 s, and the memory usage was 400 MB. Because of the high processing times, the algorithm as is is not feasible for practical use. However, the location phase of the algorithm is massively parallel, so the code can be adapted to significantly increase the efficiency...|$|R
