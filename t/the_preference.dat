5|$|<b>The</b> <b>preference</b> for sons over {{daughters in}} India {{is rooted in}} social, {{economic}} and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E

The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E

5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per year because of <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help {{to find out the}} sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too thin to provide a proper motte or simply because of <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of the builder. A fortified manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a division of land in medieval England– and was usually {{the home of the}} local lord. Fortified manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the Legislative Council as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E
5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Passchendaele offensive in October 1917. Following the success of his corps at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917, Godley believed the morale of the Germans was low, and pushed for further attacks to secure the Passchendaele Ridge. This was in concert with <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force. However, Godley's superior officer, General Herbert Plumer, preferred to halt the offensive as the weather had deteriorated immediately after the battle. An attack on 9 October by the 49th and 66th Divisions, both British formations attached to II ANZAC Corps, was hampered by the poor weather which showed no signs of abating and achieved very limited gains.|$|E

5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India.

This increased the apprehension that Nehru's assurances of 1959 and 1963 {{would not be}} kept despite Shastri's assurances to the contrary. Concerns over <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> of Hindi in central government jobs, civil service examinations and the fear that English would be replaced with Hindi as medium of instruction brought students into the anti-Hindi imposition agitation camp in large numbers. On 7 March 1964, the chief minister of Madras State, M. Bhaktavatsalam at a session of the Madras Legislative Assembly recommended the introduction of Three-language formula (English, Hindi and Tamil) in the state. Apprehension over the Three-language formula increased student support for the anti-Hindi cause.|$|E
