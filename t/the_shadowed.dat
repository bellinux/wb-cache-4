The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>shadowed</b> polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shadowed</b> {{portion of}} the crater was imaged with the Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE {{spacecraft}} using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim. The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30° slope that leads down to a 6.6km diameter floor. The handful of craters along the interior span {{no more than a}} few hundred meters. The bottom is covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400m thick. The central peak is about 200m in height.|$|E
5|$|Versions of Gill Sans {{were created}} {{in a wide range}} of styles such as {{condensed}} and shadowed weights. An ultra-light version slightly lighter than the normal light style was also not digitally available until the 2015 Nova release. Several shadowed designs were released, including a capitals-only regular shadowed design and a light-shadowed version with deep relief shadows. In the metal type era, a 'cameo ruled' design that placed white letters in boxes or against a stippled black background was available. <b>The</b> <b>shadowed</b> weights were intended to be used together with the regular, printing in different colours, to achieve a simple multicolour effect. Some of the decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by the Monotype office, with Gill examining, critiquing and approving the designs sent to him by post. The long series of extensions, redrawings and conversions into new formats of one of Monotype's most important designs (extending long beyond Gill's death) has left Gill Sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases. A book weight was created in 1993 in between the light and regular weight, suitable for body text, along with a heavy weight.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to <b>the</b> <b>shadowed</b> cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "shadow" [...] {{effect can}} also be either {{designed}} into a typeface or added to an existing typeface. Designed-in shadows can be stylized or connected to the foreground. [...] An after-market shadow effect can be created by making two copies of each glyph, slightly offset in a diagonal direction and possibly in different colors. [...] Drop shadows {{can also be}} dynamically created by rendering software. [...] The shadow effect is often combined with the outline effect, where the top layer is shown in white with black outline and the bottom layer in black, for greater contrast. An example typeface with an 'inline' effect is Imprint Shadowed, where <b>the</b> <b>shadowed</b> version is more widely distributed than the regular design.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} part of the century, one of the exponents who {{developed}} the style further was Edwin Lutyens (1864–1944). [...] At The Deanery in Berkshire, 1899, (right), where the client was the editor of the influential magazine Country Life, details like the openwork brick balustrade, the many-paned oriel window and facetted staircase tower, <b>the</b> <b>shadowed</b> windows under the eaves, or the prominent clustered chimneys were conventional Tudor revival borrowings, some of which Lutyens was to remake in his own style, that already predominates in the dark recessed entryway, the confident massing, and his signature semi-circular terrace steps. This is Tudorbethan at its best, free in ground plan, stripped of cuteness, yet warmly vernacular in effect, familiar though new, eminently liveable. An example of Tudorbethan architecture was that seen at Greaves Hall, which was built in 1900 as a mansion house for the Scarisbrick family. [...] Many of the features of the original building could still be seen until it was demolished in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The Turaga {{continue}} their tale {{of how they}} rescued the Matoran from the City of Legends. Upon the Toa Metru's return, they found Metru Nui in ruins. In their absence, vicious spider-like Rahi called Visorak had overrun the city {{under the command of}} their king, Sidorak, and his viceroy, Roodaka, while holding the sleeping Matoran captive. Capturing the Toa, the Visorak cocooned and mutated them into half-Toa, half-Rahi creatures nicknamed [...] "Toa Hordika". Rescued by the Rahaga - six small beings once Toa themselves - the Toa were told that if they wished to reverse their mutations, they must seek the legendary Keetongu: a great Rahi said to be an expert with poisons and antidotes. Putting their own problems aside, the Toa built airships to transport the Matoran out of Metru Nui and retrieved the Kanohi Mask of Light. However, a guilt-ridden Vakama succumbed to his Rahi impulses and betrayed his team by joining Sidorak and Roodaka, who made him leader of the Visorak hordes after kidnapping five of the Rahaga. The remaining Toa Hordika and Rahaga changed priorities and searched for Keetongu. Finding him in Ko-Metru, they enlisted his help in a battle against the Visorak at the Coliseum. During the conflict, Roodaka abandoned Sidorak in a fight against Keetongu and left him to die {{at the hands of the}} Rahi. She then confronted the Toa and demanded their elemental powers, to which they all fired their elemental Rhotuka spinner weapons at her - an action of which had little effect. After dispersing the Visorak, a rejuvenated Vakama also fired a spinner; hitting a shard of crystallized protodermis that sat in Roodaka's armor and knocking her unconscious. Unknowingly, the unity of the Toa's elemental powers released the Makuta from his prison, the viceroy having secretly been working for him the whole time. Seeing that the Hordika had made peace with their animal sides, Keetongu restored them to their original forms. Toa Metru once more, they bid the Rahaga and Keetongu farewell and set off with the Matoran pod-loaded airships for the island of Mata Nui. During the voyage, Vakama retrieved the Mask of Time from the protodermis sea during a battle between the revived Makuta and <b>the</b> <b>Shadowed</b> One (leader of the Dark Hunters) and blackmailed Makuta into giving the Matoran one year of peace. Once on Mata Nui, the Toa Metru sacrificed their powers to awaken the now-amnesiac Matoran and transformed into Turaga leaders. They directed the villagers into building new homes, knowing Makuta would one day return and that new prophesied Toa would, in time, arrive to fight him.|$|E
