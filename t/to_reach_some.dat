5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) {{there was no reason}} to believe that the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but if this was the norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Athenians had attempted to negotiate with the Persians previously. Plutarch suggests that {{in the aftermath of the}} victory at the Eurymedon, Artaxerxes had agreed a peace treaty with the Greeks, even naming Callias as the Athenian ambassador involved. However, as Plutarch admits, Callisthenes denied that such a peace was made at this point (c. 466 BC). Herodotus also mentions, in passing, an Athenian embassy headed by Callias, which was sent to Susa to negotiate with Artaxerxes. This embassy included some Argive representatives and can probably be therefore dated to c. 461 BC (after an alliance was agreed between Athens and Argos). This embassy may have been an attempt <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> kind of peace agreement, and it has even been suggested that the failure of these hypothetical negotiations led to the Athenian decision to support the Egyptian revolt. The ancient sources therefore disagree as to whether there was an official peace or not, and, if there was, when it was agreed.|$|E

500|$|The {{flammability}} of the crinoline {{was widely}} reported. It is estimated that, {{during the late}} 1850s and late 1860s in England, about 3,000 women were killed in crinoline-related fires. One such incident, {{the death of a}} 14-year-old kitchenmaid called Margaret Davey was reported in The Times on 13 February 1863. Her dress, [...] "distended by a crinoline," [...] ignited as she stood on the fender of the fireplace <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> spoons on the mantelpiece, and she {{died as a result of}} extensive burns. The Deputy-Coroner, commenting that he was [...] "astonished to think that the mortality from such a fashion was not brought more conspicuously under the notice of the Registrar-General," [...] passed a verdict of [...] "Accidental death by fire, caused through crinoline." [...] A similar case was reported later that year, when 16-year-old Emma Musson died after a piece of burning coke rolled from the kitchen fire to ignite her crinoline. A month later, on 8 December 1863, a serious fire at the Church of the Company of Jesus in Santiago, Chile, killed between two and three thousand people. The severity of the death toll is credited in part to the large amounts of flammable fabric that made up the women's crinoline dresses. Two notable victims of crinoline fires were William Wilde's illegitimate daughters, Emily and Mary, who died in November 1871 of burns sustained after their evening gowns caught fire. Slaveykov reported in 1864 that over the last 14 years, at least 39,927 women worldwide had died in crinoline-related fires, opining that it was more deadly than the practice of sati or the auto-da-fé. Although flame-retardant fabrics were available, these were thought unattractive and were unpopular.|$|E

2500|$|Australian {{diesel-electric}} submarines {{operate in}} a wide range of geographic and oceanographic conditions, from the cold Southern Ocean to the tropics of the Coral, Arafura, and Timor Seas – requiring the submarines to handle significant variances in temperature, salinity, density, and climate. Australian submarines provide a deterrent towards military aggression against Australia, by patrolling the waters of Australia and nearby nations, and in addition, gather intelligence through the interception of electronic communications by foreign nations, and assist in the deployment and retrieval of special forces operatives. Because RAN submarines operate from a remote location at , and because some of Australia's strategic interests are located as far afield as the Persian Gulf and the North Pacific, Australian submarines have to transit long distances <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> of their potential patrol areas. This requirement for range and endurance resulted in the 1980s Collins-class design incorporating a large fuel load, large engines and sufficient batteries to transit these long distances, although technological improvements since then have enabled smaller diesel-electric submarines such as the German Type 214 submarine and Dutch Walrus-class submarine to achieve similar range and endurance as the Collins-class.

2500|$|It {{have been}} found that, the {{initially}} predicted tsunami height by the tsunami warning system was lower than the actual tsunami height {{and it could be}} connected to the delayed escape of some residents. For the purpose of quick calculation and timely warning, initial earthquake and tsunami warning being issued for the event was base on , which only take about 3 minutes to calculate but is based on the maximum amplitude of seismic wave, similar to Richter magnitude scale, and is thus suffer from the same problem of saturation above the certain earthquake magnitude (Magnitude 8 for JMA magnitude), which resulted in underestimation on tsunami height in initial reports. Also, the warning system was supposed to be updated about 15 minutes after earthquake occur when calculation for moment magnitude scale completed, however thee strong quake have exceeded the measure limit of all the teleseismometer within Japan and thus it was impossible to calculate the moment magnitude based on data from those meters. The second update on the tsunami warning was released 28 minutes after the earthquake based on observation, which was reportedly unable <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> residents due to circumstances like power cut, and observed data from off coast tidal meter were also not fully reflected in the second warning. Also, shortly after the earthquake, some wave meters have reported a fluctuation of [...] "20 centimeter" [...] and the value was broadcast across mass media and warning system, which caused some resident to underestimate the situation and even delayed or suspended their evacuation.|$|E
2500|$|This corrupts {{the bottom}} of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with {{seemingly}} random symbols and tiles, overwriting the values of edible dots which makes it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this [...] "split-screen" [...] level is often referred to as the [...] "kill screen". There are 114 dots on the left half of the screen, nine dots on the right, and one bonus key, totaling 6,310 points. When all of the dots have been cleared, nothing happens. The game does not consider a level to be completed until 244 dots have been eaten. Each time a life is lost, the nine dots on the right half of the screen get reset and can be eaten again, resulting in an additional 90 points per extra man. In the best-case scenario (five extra men), 6,760 points will be the maximum score possible, but only 168 dots can be harvested, and that is not enough to change levels. Four of the nine dots on the right half of the screen are invisible, but can be heard when eaten. [...] Some dots are invisible but the rest can be seen, although some are a different color from normal. One method for safely clearing this round is to trap the ghosts. To trap the three important ghosts, the player must begin by going right until Pac-man reaches a blue letter 'N', and then he goes down. He keeps going down until he reaches a blue letter 'F' and then he goes right. He keeps going right until he reaches a yellow 'B', and then he goes down again. When executed properly, Pac-Man will hit an invisible wall almost immediately after the last turn is made. Eventually, the red ghost will get stuck. The pink ghost follows a few seconds later. The blue ghost will continue to move freely for several moments until the next scatter mode occurs. At that point, it will try <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> location near the right edge of the screen and get stuck with the pink and red ghost instead. The orange ghost is the only one still on the loose, but he is no real threat since he runs to his corner whenever Pac-Man gets close so that it is easy to eat all the dots. Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen if this 256th level is cleared: the fruit and intermissions would restart at level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.|$|E
