40|$|Abstract [...] With {{the large}} {{increase}} of distributed renewable electric energy generation, {{the need for}} more transmission capacity is obvious. As restrictions practically prevent building new overhead lines, options to increase transmission capacities of existing lines are inevitable. The transmission capacity of overhead transmission lines itself is often constrained by temperature limitations of the conductors. One strategy connected with smart energy transmission is to calculate present and future transmission capacities of the lines based on actual weather conditions and forecasts, rather than relying on a static and conservative fixed value. By this, an increased transmission capacity can be enabled. To do so, models to calculate thermal ratings have to be refined and improved, especially in the range of conductor temperatures close to their limits. In this temperature range, measurement data for assessing the accuracy of existing calculation methods is still scarce. The knowledge of the accuracy of the <b>thermal</b> <b>rating</b> calculation methods is vital as otherwise lifetime specifications of the conductors may be at risk. The paper explores the potential of dynamic <b>thermal</b> <b>rating</b> of overhead lines starting with state-of-the-art calculation formulas. The shortcomings of these formulas are discussed. One is the assumption of homogeneous temperature distribution within the conductors. The differential equation for the heat transfer in a cylindrical overhead line conductor is solved taking into account both the skin-effect on the current distribution and different heat transfer conditions. These calculations reveal relevant radial temperature gradients, underlining the importance of more elaborate and reliable thermal modeling of the conductors. Further, planned setups to perform laboratory-experiments are introduced. In particular, an overview of available temperature measurement systems and sensors being under evaluation for the upcoming laboratory and field measurements are presented.

(Mechanical Engineering) Eskom {{fossil fuel}} power {{stations}} operate {{under various conditions}} and the ageing fleet of fossil fuel power stations are under strain due to the rising demand in electricity. The quest for cheaper electricity in growing businesses and bringing foreign investment into South Africa is significant for economic growth. Therefore, minimizing operation costs and improving availability, reliability and <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> are key objectives for {{the operation of the}} business. <b>Thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> calculation is a method used to assess the performance of fossil fuel power stations. It provides an indication of the thermal performance which reflects the condition and operation of the plant. This dissertation refers to the tools used to measure the condenser performance and to identify the reason for unhealthy condenser performance and an increase in <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate.</b> Problem: Poor condenser performance causes significant losses in generation and <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> in fossil fuel plants. Loss in generation and <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> is caused by condenser backpressure. This has an adverse effect on turbine <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> and henceturbine efficiency. The performance of the condenser affects the turbine performance to a large extent. Decreased condenser performance will increase the turbine <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate,</b> i. e. kJ/kWh, because of the increased steam consumption per kWh of energy generated and therefore lowering the overall turbine efficiency. This will result in poor <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> efficiency resulting in an increased coal burn rate, i. e. kg/kWh, and an increased fuel bill and carbon foot print for the fossil fuel power station. The aim of this dissertation is {{to determine the effects of}} condenser performance on <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> and to provide the engineering and operating personnel with a guide for monitoring condenser back pressure in order to improve turbine <b>thermal</b> heat <b>rate</b> and turbine efficiency.

METHODS AND RESULTS:  Actual TSS of Chardonnay, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon was measured in commercial vineyards in Coonawarra, Barossa Valley and Riverland. Predictions used (i) the default 1 °Bé/week; (ii) variety- and location-specific chronological rates between 0. 8 and 1. 2 °Bé/week; and (iii) variety- and location-specific <b>thermal</b> <b>rates</b> between 0. 009 and 0. 019 °Bé/Cd.
