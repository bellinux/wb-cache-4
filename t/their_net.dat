5|$|The star Lambda (λ) Tauri is an {{eclipsing binary}} star. This system {{consists}} of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The plane of their orbit lies almost {{along the line of}} sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 astronomical units, so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of <b>their</b> <b>net</b> magnitude throughout each orbit.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting <b>their</b> <b>net</b> income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to relatives or simply saved for retirement.|$|E
50|$|Those {{commercial}} fisherman who trawl generally oppose Rigs-to-Reefs because <b>their</b> <b>nets</b> may snag a rig, {{creating a}} hazardous situation. This is particularly {{the case in}} offshore California with bottom trawling commercial fishermen, who can foul <b>their</b> <b>nets</b> on the shell mounds that build up on the sea floor near the rig. Several fisherman have reported tangling <b>their</b> <b>nets</b> on submerged rigs.|$|R

50|$|Synodontis schall {{are very}} {{important}} to Benin, a country in Africa. Fishermen in Africa catch these fish in <b>their</b> <b>nets</b> and so they must break the spines of the fish {{to get them out of}} <b>their</b> <b>nets.</b> Synodontis schall can be caught for food or even traded since they are prized fish.|$|R
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), <b>their</b> <b>net</b> effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about {{the pros and cons}} of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage <b>their</b> <b>net</b> income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E

60|$|Still we dashed on, {{and still}} the {{fishermen}} dashed on behind. The value of <b>their</b> <b>nets</b> was greater than the fines {{they would have to}} pay for violating the fish laws; so to cast off from <b>their</b> <b>nets</b> and escape, which they could easily do, would profit them nothing. Further, they remained by <b>their</b> <b>nets</b> instinctively, as a sailor remains by his ship. And still further, the desire for vengeance was roused, and we could depend upon it that they would follow us {{to the ends of the}} earth, if we undertook to tow them that far.|$|R

Gayle set the tempo through his blitzing knock of 44 off a mere 17 balls. The game was superbly finshed by none other than Pollard himself on the second last ball of the match via a boundary. Gayle's knock and Pollard's finishing helped Karachi win this encounter against Islamabad.|$|E
