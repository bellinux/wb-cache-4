5|$|In-water {{recompression}} (IWR) is {{the emergency}} treatment of decompression sickness (DCS) by sending the diver back underwater {{to allow the}} gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve.

5|$|The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) {{opened a}} file on Burhop in 1948, believing {{him to be}} a secret member of the Communist Party of Australia, and an {{associate}} of Ian Milner, who was known through Venona intercepts to have passed secret documents to the Soviet Union. In July 1951, the British government cancelled his passport when he accepted an offer <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. A new passport was issued after he gave the Foreign Secretary a written assurance that he would not seek <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union or other Iron Curtain countries.|$|E

5|$|An award-winning {{documentary}} about the escape was made by Claude Lanzmann, entitled Sobibor, 14 Octobre 1943, 16 heures. The revolt was also dramatized in the 1987 British TV movie Escape from Sobibor, in which Rutger Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Television) for his portrayal of Pechersky. Pechersky however {{did not attend the}} premiere of the movie; his widow later stated that the Soviet government denied him permission <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance they would have <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pole by dogsled. Budington {{did not want to}} further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E

5|$|Following his release, O'Keefe {{spent one}} month on trial at Aston Villa and {{impressed}} the club's coaching staff, including youth coach Gordon Cowans, but {{was forced to}} leave the club, who were only willing to offer him a one-year youth contract, after struggling <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Midlands-based club on a regular basis as he continued to prepare for his GCSEs. He was also offered a trial with Nottingham Forest, scoring during a friendly match with the club but O'Keefe again moved on after the club stalled over offering him a contract, with Forest only willing to offer him a one-year youth deal.|$|E
5|$|From 1898, the {{newspapers}} that had encouraged so many <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Klondike {{lost interest in}} it. In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking {{the end of the}} rush. The boom towns declined and the population of Dawson City fell. Gold mining activity lasted until 1903 when production peaked after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.|$|E

Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Dorothy died in England the following year.

5|$|Anderson visited Confederate sympathizers as he traveled, {{some of whom}} viewed him as a {{hero for}} {{fighting}} the Union, whom they deeply hated. Many of Anderson's men also despised the Union, and he was adept at tapping into this emotion. The Union soldier held captured at Centralia {{was impressed with the}} control that Anderson exercised over his men. Although many of them wished to execute this Union hostage, Anderson refused to allow it. On October 6, Anderson and his men traveled to meet General Price in Boonville, Missouri. Price was disgusted that Anderson used scalps to decorate his horse, and would not speak with him until he removed them. He was, however, impressed by the effectiveness of Anderson's attacks. Anderson presented him with a gift of fine Union pistols, likely captured at Centralia. Price instructed Anderson <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Missouri railroad and disrupt rail traffic, making Anderson a de facto Confederate captain.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} {{among the}} Christians of Neapolis decreased, {{tensions between the}} Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became {{the site of a}} deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.|$|E
5|$|As {{the civil}} disobedience {{campaign}} {{spread to other}} parts of the north-east, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike accused ITAK of trying to establish a separate state. In April 1961 the satyagrahas were removed by the army using brutal force. A state of emergency was declared on 18 April 1961. ITAK was banned, and its MPs and other leading members arrested and imprisoned at Panagoda Cantonment. Chelvanayakam was allowed to leave the camp and return home due to his deteriorating health. Chelvanayakam suffered from Parkinson's disease and his hearing had been gradually failing. After initially refusing, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike allowed Chelvanayakam <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK to undergo surgery in Edinburgh at the hands of a neurosurgeon Francis John Gillingham. The operation was successful and after a few months recuperating in London Chelvanayakam returned to Ceylon.|$|E
