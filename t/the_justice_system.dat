They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} <b>the</b> administrative <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> {{which represents}} one of the key control mechanisms of the public administration in The Czech Republic. The aim of this thesis is to compare <b>the</b> administrative <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> of <b>The</b> Czech Republic with selected European models of <b>the</b> administrative <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> such as <b>the</b> French and German <b>justice</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>The</b> result of this comparison highlights <b>the</b> differences in <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> and considers <b>the</b> possibility of implementing these models in The Czech legal <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> administrative <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> in <b>The</b> Czech Republic has been developing since 2003, when The Act N. 150 / 2002 came into effect. <b>The</b> operating administrative <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> in <b>The</b> Czech Republic is characterized by the following criteria: statutory framework, power and jurisdiction of the administrative court, organization of <b>the</b> administrative <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> and <b>the</b> course of the judicial administrative proceedings.

The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the general}} population, ethnic {{minorities}} experience {{a range of}} health care disparities. These include a lack of health insurance, {{lack of access to}} health care, lack of knowledge about existing health services, mis/under-diagnoses, and poorly developed cultural sensitivity or discrimination among health care providers. <b>The</b> <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> are disproportionately comprised of ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans and Hispanics. Health care provision, especially mental health, is sorely lacking within <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>systems,</b> contributing to recidivism. Given these considerations, this study aims to investigate the extent that ethnic minorities with histories in <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> report health care disparities. The paper is based on firsthand ethnographic data collected in South Los Angeles from participants at a community-based organization (n= 10). <b>Justice</b> <b>systems</b> involvement was defined as having ever been arrested. All participants (n= 10) were either African American or Hispanic. Results reveal that such individuals report a range of health care disparities...|$|R
5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons working in <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required {{to disclose their}} membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E

5|$|The backstory of {{the game}} is {{described}} in the fourth case, Turnabout Reminiscence. Ten years prior to the game's present, the secretariat of the Cohdopian Embassy was accused of murdering Cece Yew, a witness to a smuggling ring's connection to the embassy. Prosecutor Byrne Faraday and detective Tyrell Badd attempted to convict the secretariat, but he went free after key evidence was stolen. Feeling that <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> was powerless to those who stand above the law, Faraday, Badd, and Yew's sister Calisto, started stealing corporate files detailing illegal or unethical activities and exposed them to the media, under the name Yatagarasu. Three years later, another murder occurred at the embassy. During the trial, in which Faraday was the prosecutor, the suspect, Mack Rell, claimed that he had been told by Faraday to commit the murder, and said that Faraday was the Yatagarasu. A recess was held to replace Faraday with another prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth; before court was reconvened, both Rell and Faraday were found dead. Edgeworth discovered that Calisto had murdered Faraday with help from Rell, then killed Rell and made it look like Faraday and Rell had killed each other. When confronted, Calisto says that she is Yatagarasu, not mentioning her two partners, and that she is part of the smuggling ring. Faraday's daughter Kay is comforted over Faraday's death by Edgeworth, Badd, and detective Gumshoe; she believes her father to be the true Yatagarasu, and vows to catch the fake.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how Burmese residents in Indianapolis perceive <b>the</b> Criminal <b>Justice</b> <b>System,</b> and <b>the</b> perceived effectiveness of the system to their community. This study will enhance past literature by giving a narrative to a minority group that has been overlooked in <b>the</b> Criminal <b>Justice</b> literature. Purposive sampling methods were used and the study was conducted within the Indianapolis area at several public facilities. In-depth interviews will be conducted with approximately 10 - 15 respondents. Questions range from open-ended such as how do you perceive <b>the</b> Criminal <b>Justice</b> <b>System,</b> what has shaped these views, to questions that involve Burmese residents that have interacted with <b>the</b> Criminal <b>Justice</b> <b>System</b> such as how did you perceive your treatment.

40|$|Confidence in <b>the</b> {{criminal}} <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> {{has emerged}} as a critical issue at the interface of <b>the</b> administration of <b>justice</b> and political pressures in western democracies. For more than a decade, governments in the West have felt acute pressure to make <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> more relevant, more transparent and more accountable. The ‘crisis of confidence’, particularly in judges and sentencing, has led to a range of high profi le policy announcements seeking to ‘modernise’ <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> This trend was most pronounced in the United Kingdom in the period from around 1998 to 2004 under the Blair government and led to an outpouring of analyses, investigations and reforms aimed at improving confi dence in <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> This paper reviews some of these developments but also takes {{a closer look at the}} nature of public confidence in <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> in Australia. Using the results of the latest Australian Survey of Social Attitudes, aspects of public confidence are examined with a particular focus on the evaporation of confi dence in <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> from police, through courts to corrections.

This review focuses on how the cumulative policies and practices of <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> contribute to churning, or the recycling of individuals through the system. In conducting our review, we describe how <b>the</b> same criminal <b>justice</b> processes and practices adversely affect select communities.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{criminal}} <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> in Aotearoa, New Zealand has {{a destructive}} history of interactions with Māori. Considered alongside the broader context of colonisation, this history provides a backdrop against which to understand contemporary Māori experiences of institutional racism. This research project aims {{to provide a}} robust understanding of Māori historical, contemporary and lived experiences of institutional racism within <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> Participants were five Māori adults who have had personal encounters with <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> They were interviewed about their experiences within <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> {{with a focus on}} their experiences of institutional racism. As Kaupapa Māori research, within the field of discursive psychology, deficit constructions of Māori were rejected and there is an explicit inclination toward a constructive narrative of Māori culture, identity, and history. From the analysis emerged four recurring linguistic resources; blatant racism, Māori and Pākehā identities, Māori as trapped in <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> and Māori identity and culture as strength. Participants’ perspectives of <b>the</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> reveal that prevailing power relations facilitate the belittling of Māori identity, intrude on Māori rights, and diminish cultural integrity. Institutional racism is constructed as enduring and guided by notions of Māori cultural inferiority. <b>The</b> criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> has persistently operated to disadvantage and marginalise Māori and the discussion extends on arguments for a separate Māori criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
