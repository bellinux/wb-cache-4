5|$|Herne Bay {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Chatham Main Line, which runs between Ramsgate in East Kent and London Victoria. Other {{stations}} on this line include Broadstairs, Margate, Whitstable, Faversham, Gillingham, Rochester and Bromley South. Herne Bay is around 1hour and 40minutes from London. A National Express coach service also runs between London Victoria and Ramsgate, around every <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> during daytime. A selection of trains run to London's Cannon Street station, primarily for business commuting.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> to complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E

5|$|Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan {{waited for}} Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was {{expected}} to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite12:00 or 14:00varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. The narrow defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack in waves. Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle. The French were outnumbered more than three to one, assaulted in the front by Miloradovich's column, in the middle by Strik's and in the rear by Dokhturov.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E
50|$|English {{language}} media often conflate the siesta {{with the}} <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> lunch break which {{is characteristic of}} Spanish working hours, even though the working population {{is less likely to}} have time for a siesta and the two events are not necessarily connected. In fact, the average Spaniard works longer hours than almost all their European counterparts (typically 11-hour days, from 9am to 8pm).|$|R
50|$|The PCCA {{curriculum}} {{is centered on}} individualized instruction and concentrating on the student's selected artistic major. Through blocking courses with <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> segments of time, the student {{has the opportunity to}} develop a work in depth while the teacher is afforded time to work individually with the students as well as provide guest artists and field trips without impinging on the student's daily four academic classes.|$|R
50|$|Argia {{operates}} {{during the}} months of May through October. She is a replica of a 19th-century schooner, designed and built by Captain Frank Fulchiero. Fulchiero named the boat after Argia the water nymph of the Tiber River in Rome. She carries up to 49 passengers on the waters of Fishers Island Sound for <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> day sails, charters, and marine science/ coastal ecology programs. The Coastal Ecology Program utilizes various sampling and testing techniques {{to provide students with}} a better understanding of marine and coastal ecosystems.|$|R
5|$|The player {{directly}} {{controls the}} character Lightning through a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the character, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of Lightning Returns, as with Final Fantasy XIII and its sequel XIII-2, is rendered to scale with the character, who navigates the world on foot. In one of the areas, the player can use chocobos, a recurring animal in the Final Fantasy series. The player is able to freely navigate the game's open world layout, explore towns and country areas, and accept quests from various non-playable characters (NPCs). Lightning is also able to sprint for limited periods, climb up ladders and jump freely. The game features three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard, the latter of which is unlocked after first completing the game. There is also a New Game+ option, whereby players can start a new game while carrying over their equipment and stats from a previous playthrough. The in-game clock runs continuously during normal navigation, with one in-game day equating to <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> in real time on Easy mode and one hour on Normal and Hard modes. The timer starts out at seven in-game days, but can be extended {{to a maximum of}} thirteen days. The timer stops during cutscenes, conversations and battles. Lightning can also pause time using an ability called Chronostasis.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} concern of raw milk, {{there is a growing}} need for other methods of {{preparing}} rancid milk for milk judging. The origin of rancidity in milk is due to lipolysis caused the lipase enzyme. However, with pasteurization, the lipase enzyme is inactivated. The purpose of this experiment was to compare the effect of using lipase powder to other current methods of preparing rancid milk, such as utilizing raw milk. Result showed that all treatments caused desired rancidity. The second purpose was to compare the rancidity between Method A, <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> incubation at room temperature, and Method B, twenty-four hour refrigerated.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} web based collaboration tools fuels design conversation between heterogeneous stakeholders across organizational boundaries, underscoring {{the need for}} new designers to get to the heart of conversations that might include huge numbers of entries. The goal of this work is to show that linkography is a viable candidate to help make that kind of discovery possible. A linkograph links design moves with prior moves, resulting in a model of the design episode. The research methods were mixed, though primarily qualitative. The primary data comprised records of a series of eleven <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> design meetings over a six month duration, with five participants. A model for predicting the location of topic shifts was developed on the first two exploratory meetings, and tested on the remaining nine design meetings. The model used a finer-than-topic-shift granularity linkograph of the nine meetings to predict topic shifts. It combined a measure of both backward and forward links, plus a threshold, in order to segment the design discourse on topic shifts. An additional threshold comprising a number of segments was used to filter transitive links to retrieve contextualizing information from the discourse. The test included quantitative comparison of model segmentation with human segmentation, and qualitative evaluation of relevant contextual information drawn (using the model, the segmentation, and the linkograph) from previous design conversations. The results suggest that employment of linkography is a viable and pragmatic addition to design rationale...|$|R
