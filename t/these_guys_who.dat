Jesus, what sheer power! ... It was a noise you could never forget. RLI Lance-Corporal Jimmy Swan recalls the assault on Jorge do Limpopo on 29 May 1977 The 24 men from 2 Commando charged the anti-aircraft positions as RhAF Hawker Hunters flew in overhead at 100 ft, strafing the FRELIMO-ZANLA lines. The guerrillas retreated into well-camouflaged foxholes as the Rhodesians moved forward. The RLI men were now joined {{by most of the}} Selous Scouts, who left their vehicles outside the town. Nearby buildings were swept for hidden guerrillas while 2 Commando bombed three bunkers, killing nine or ten FRELIMO fighters. With resistance at the town's border destroyed, the Scouts now advanced through it street by street, clearing it quickly, efficiently and ruthlessly. The Rhodesians rendezvoused at Jorge do Limpopo railway station, where the flying column's vehicles assembled. Murphy discovered that the main ZANLA base had been moved to Mapai, a village with an airstrip on the Nuanetsi River to the south-west, and diverted his force to attack it.

[...] Deriding the character as a [...] "living embodiment of an Avril Lavigne t-shirt", he pointed out the pointlessness of being inspired to super heroics by radical philosophy, and the contradictory nature of fighting crime as an anarchist.

Similarly, Cracked contributor Henrik Magnusson listed Anarky's debut at No.3 on a list of [...] "5 Disastrous Attempts at Political Commentary in Comic Books." [...] Magnusson's scorn focused on Anarky's poorly written speeches, which he derided as [...] "pedantic" [...] and laden with [...] "pseudo-philosophical catchphrases." [...] Referring to the original identity of Lonnie Machin as a [...] "naive pre-teen", Magnusson considered this fine satire of [...] "base-level philosophy" [...] and teen rebellion. However, the understanding that Grant had intended Anarky to be a vehicle for his personal views, and that the [...] "Anarky in Gotham City" [...] narrative describes Batman as sympathetic to his goals, if not his methods, upset Magnusson. [...] "I think Anarky's age is right now. He looks like a street protester. He looks like Anonymous. He's like one of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> wants {{to go out there and}} change the world to what he believes is the better, and I think of all the Batman enemies, and one of the reasons I'm most excited about Anarky, is he feels relevant today." [...] —Eric Holmes, 2013. Several global events of the early 2010s included the rise of hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec; large scale protest movements, including the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, and Quebec student protests; the crypto-anarchist activity on the part of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson; and the various information leaks to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning, the Stratfor email leak by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond, and the global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden. The rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that Anarky's relevance as a character had dramatically increased, and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media. This sentiment led the creative team that developed Batman: Arkham Origins to include Anarky in the game. Describing Anarky's anti-government and anti-corporate agenda, Holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement. Holmes stressed in one interview, [...] "In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today." [...] Even as early as 2005, James Peaty recommended that Anarky should be included in more publications in the midst of the ongoing War on Terror, stating [...] "Anarky is a terrorist!

40|$|Selling to the {{processing}} industry Cue: High value spice crops like vanilla and cardamom {{can be a}} tempting option for farmers wanting to earn more money. But growing these crops needs specialist knowledge and attention to detail, and farmers {{must be ready to}} invest in order to get their production started. One way {{to reduce the risk of}} failure is to have a contract with a buyer, such as a spice company, who can support in the production of the crop and be a guaranteed market. Uganda Crop Industry, for example, is a food processing company which contracts farmer groups to grow cardamom, a popular spice in Asian cooking. Ronald Kafeero is the chairman of one of these groups, and he spoke recently to Wambi Michael about how they grow and sell the spice. Before visiting Ronald, however, Wambi first met with Abdul Majidu, an extension worker with {{the processing}} company. He asked Abdul how many farmers supply their cardamom. IN:	?We have around 400 people ? OUT:	? have got that good example. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ronald Kafeero, who grows cardamom for the Uganda Crop Industry. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Majidu	We have around 400 people. The people were just very much in contact. Michael	They finally sell the product to you? Majidu	Indeed. Michael	Now let?s start our motorcycle, we go and see <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> grow cardamom. We are now going to see some of the farmers who grow cardamom in part of this area. SFX	Motorcycle engine. Michael	We are now in Lugazi. We are meeting one of the farmers here in Lugazi Good afternoon sir. Kafeero	Good afternoon. Michael	How are you? Kafeero	I?m alright, how are you sir? Michael	Fine, how is here? Kafeero	We are ok here. Michael	Now we are talking about the growing of cardamom and I can see we are standing next to this crop. When did you begin growing cardamom? Kafeero	I began growing cardamom in 2004. We have a group which is called Kyosimbonanya. We were trained to grow cardamom so I became a model farmer here and I?m benefiting from cardamom. Michael	And how many are you in the group? Kafeero	We are 18 members. Michael	Ok, how do you market this cardamom after growing? Kafeero	After growing cardamom, after picking it from the garden, we take it straight to the Uganda Crop Industry and get our money just immediately. Michael	Immediately? Because in the past we used to have scenarios where you would grow coffee then they wait for years to get their money. So with cardamom you grow it immediately and get it? Kafeero	Yeah, and get the money. Michael	Ok. Tell us how you market this product? Kafeero	Ok. Us in our group we just gather our cardamom, all of us here, so that we send it and sell it as a group, in Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How good is that? Kafeero	That one is better because it takes a short time, takes a little time. One person can go, a person who we trust can go there, and the rest remain working in their farms, so that we don?t waste time. Michael	Now how do you ensure the quality of cardamom that you send to Uganda Crop Industries? Kafeero	That one, we were trained by some of our instructors. The best quality of cardamom we know and we just collect it, when it is about green. Michael	Now let?s talk again about this group marketing element. How are the farmers who are growing cardamom benefiting from selling of cardamom? Kafeero	We were suffering when we were selling it, this coffee, because we were selling just individually. But now as a group, our people have benefited very much because we gather our crop at my home here and we take it there to Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How do you share out what you have got in terms of sales? Kafeero	I have a weighing scale here. So every person who has brought his cardamom we have to know the exact kilos which we are just taking. So we gather it together, after getting the kilos of every individual, so that we send it there. Michael	And how good is this? Kafeero	That one is very good because it does not waste time and we are working together. So we are benefiting and we are advising the money which we get from there, we advise our farmers, do this one, do that one. Myself, I?m going to Kituza for more knowledge and I?ll be going to the other institute at Kampala there for more training because I have gathered enough money. Even some boda bodas, the boys are busy making money. Michael	You mean you bought motorcycles that you gave out to people? Kafeero	To people. Michael	Are you doing that also as a group, like a grouped people? Kafeero	Yes, we are doing it in Kyosimbonanya Farmers? Group, and already about ten of us we have boda bodas which are busy at the Lugazi town, who work there. Michael	In the past we had some farmers when they had the vanilla boom, people used to bring nails and whatever and they put in vanilla. So you as a group, how do you ensure quality of the cardamom? Kafeero	As we have learnt from our people with vanilla, they were spoiling their crop, whereby even there it had no market. So with us we ensure that we do something which is good so that it does not spoil our market, as it spoiled the market of those people with vanilla. We have got that good example.
