6000|$|... "I know, sir!" [...] exclaimed the Captain, {{who stood}} at the dunce's {{extremity}} of the line, holding <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> with true schoolboy eagerness.|$|R
60|$|Abruptly, {{still under}} the {{pressure}} of <b>his</b> wrath, he <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
60|$|Summerlee <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> chin, {{with its}} little wagging tuft of goatee beard.|$|R
60|$|Tom Haggin <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand in abrupt good-bye, resolutely {{keeping his}} eyes from {{dropping}} to Jerry in the other's arms.|$|R
60|$|A sharp cry {{broke from}} the spy's lips. He threw himself forward, <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> neck, {{expanded}} his eyes, clenched his hands.|$|R
60|$|Stenterello <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> paw {{and gave}} four short, shrill barks; {{upon which the}} elder lady turned round and raised her forefinger.|$|R
6000|$|Blake <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hands in}} a gesture of horrified repudiation. [...] "Richard!" [...] he cried in deep reproof and again, [...] "Richard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then--then take that!" [...] But {{the blow}} never touched Trent. He <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hand and held}} his assailant away at arm's length.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon he leisurely {{consumed}} {{the property in}} dispute, shut his eyes, yawned, turned upon <b>his</b> back, <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> legs divergently, and died.|$|R
6000|$|The giant {{rolled his}} single bloodthirsty eye, and sneered, <b>thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> heavy jaw. [...] "We'll wring the dog's neck if there's any treachery." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> mangled fore-foot, all {{dark with}} dried blood. There were cruel bites low {{down on his}} side, and his throat was torn and worried.|$|R
60|$|The door slowly opened, just {{far enough}} for the Ugly One to <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand and take the {{handkerchief}} and the knife. Then it closed again.|$|R
60|$|The old man <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> tongue; and, to Pool's amazement, he saw {{the surface}} of that {{sensitive}} organ, from root to tip, tattooed in intricate designs.|$|R
60|$|But this Christmas--he {{surprised}} {{himself and}} Nelly suddenly by hotly <b>thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand and touching her sleeve with the searching finger-tips {{of a child}} comforted from night fears.|$|R
5000|$|Moe holding <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> to Curly and says, [...] "See that?" [...] When Curly replies, [...] "Yeah," [...] he smacks {{the fist}} dismissively, {{in which it}} swings in a circle behind Moes body, over his head, and bops Curly {{on the head with}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "The odds be damned!" [...] Wolverstone <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> heavy jowl. [...] "We're used to odds. The odds was heavier at Maracaybo; yet we won out, {{and took}} three ships. They was heavier {{yesterday}} when we engaged Don Miguel." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ready-Money Jack was on {{his feet}} in a twinkling, <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, gave his ancient crony the gripe of a giant, and {{slapping}} the other hand on a bench, [...] "Sit down there," [...] cried he, [...] "Tom Slingsby!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucian, {{sick with}} fury, and half paralyzed by a {{sensation}} {{which he would}} not acknowledge as fear, forced himself to come forward. Cashel <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> jaw invitingly, and said, with a sinister grin, [...] "Put it in straight, governor. Twenty pounds, remember." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{attempting}} {{to express his}} gratification, the Chief of Police <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> right hand with such violence that his skin was ruptured at the arm-pit and a stream of sawdust poured from the wound. He was a stuffed Chief of Police.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the child}} could reply to this earnest solicitation, the street-door opened, and Mr Brass <b>thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> night-capped head {{called in a}} surly voice, 'Who's there!' Kit {{immediately}} glided away, and Nell, closing the window softly, drew back into the room.|$|R
6000|$|John Bellew <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hand and}} spoke solemnly. [...] "Christopher, my boy, I {{believe you can}} do it. I believe {{you can do it}} with that pack on your back at the same time. You've made good, boy, though it's too unthinkable to believe." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> long arm and {{snatched}} his wrinkly vest from a chair. He {{took out a}} cigar, a match. He tossed the vest on the floor. He lighted the cigar and puffed savagely. He broke up the match and snapped the fragments at the foot-board.|$|R
60|$|Had {{the blow}} landed as intended, Dave {{would have been}} seriously lamed, and {{possibly}} his arm might have been broken. But Roger was close at hand, and in a flash the senator's son <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hockey stick, so that the blow glanced off, doing little harm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Through here," [...] said Mr. Pogram, {{coming to}} a side door in the garden wall, [...] "we can make a short cut to the police station. As we go along I shall ask you one or two blunt questions." [...] And he <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> under lip: ...|$|R
60|$|The mocking chant rose {{louder and}} louder. Will leaned closer as he danced, <b>thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> tongue. Johnny's left arm shot out {{and caught the}} other around the neck. At {{the same time he}} rapped <b>his</b> bony <b>fist</b> to the other's nose. It was a pathetically bony fist, but that it was sharp to hurt was {{evidenced}} by the squeal of pain it produced. The other children were uttering frightened cries, while Johnny's sister, Jennie, had dashed into the house.|$|R
60|$|The Indian {{was struck}} with this reply, which suited the {{character}} of <b>his</b> mind. <b>Thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, he received mine, and shook it cordially, as much as {{to say he was}} satisfied. Having disposed of this episode thus satisfactorily, we turned to the more interesting subject of our immediate movements.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me go!" [...] yelled Pelter, {{and tried}} to hurl Dick to one side. Then Japson struck <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> but the oldest Rover boy dodged.|$|R
60|$|He {{concluded}} his desultory {{speech by}} <b>thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> large bony paw, {{filled with a}} Scottish mull of huge dimensions, which Herries, who had been standing like one petrified by the assurance of this unexpected address, rejected with a contemptuous motion of his hand, which spilled some {{of the contents of}} the box.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fraser, <b>thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{lower lip}} and making his chant {{of the last}} word the more {{emphatic}} for a little impatience at being interrupted, had already turned his eyes on his book again, while Deronda, as if something had stung him, started up in a sitting attitude {{with his back to}} the tutor.|$|R
6000|$|The whole {{neighbourhood}} {{would be}} aroused by this pomp and circumstance. The cobbler would leave his last; the barber would <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> frizzed head, with a comb sticking in it; a knot would collect at the grocer's door; {{and the word}} would be buzzed {{from one end of}} the street to the other, [...] "The doctor's riding <b>out</b> to <b>his</b> country-seat." ...|$|R
60|$|The broad avenue was {{suddenly}} thronged {{with a mass}} of soldiery--guardsmen {{of the most famous}} of Austrian regiments, brilliant in their white uniforms, their flashing helmets. The small brougham with its great black horses was almost hidden within a ring of naked steel. Dorward, an American to the backbone and a bitter democrat, <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> under-lip.|$|R
60|$|Oliver's {{face turned}} red with furious anger. His strange blue eyes grew cold with hatred, and he <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> scarlet lips till {{he had the}} {{ruthless}} expression of a Nero. The gibe at his obesity had caught him on the raw. Susie feared {{that he would make}} so insulting a reply that a quarrel must ensure.|$|R
6000|$|Challenger <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{aggressive}} chin {{until he}} was all beard and hat-rim. [...] "No doubt, sir, a limited knowledge would have that effect. When one's knowledge is exhaustive, one comes to other conclusions." [...] They glared {{at each other in}} mutual defiance, while all round rose the distant whisper, [...] "We will kill you--we will kill you if we can." ...|$|R
60|$|As he {{said this}} {{he took a few}} crumbs of broken meat {{from the bottom of the}} {{provision}} sack and spread them on his right hand; then he lay down under a bush, covered his face with a few leaves, and <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand. Heywood and the Indian retired a few paces and stood still to await the result.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, sir?" [...] {{answered}} Salterne, in a grim, half-sneering tone, <b>thrusting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> square-grizzled {{beard and}} chin. [...] "Why not, sir? why should I not make merry when I have {{the honor of}} a noble captain in my house? one who has sailed the seas, sir, and cut Spaniards' throats; and may cut them again too; eh, sir? Boy, where's the kettle and the sugar?" ...|$|R
60|$|John Harned replied nothing. He struck <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> He smote Luis Cervallos in {{the face}} so that he fell like a dead man across the chairs and did not rise again. He saw nothing of what followed. But I saw much. Urcisino Castillo, leaning forward from the next box, with his cane struck John Harned full across the face. And John Harned smote him with <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> so that in falling he overthrew General Salazar. John Harned was now in what-you-call Berserker rage--no? The beast {{primitive}} in him was loose and roaring--the beast primitive of the holes and caves of the long ago.|$|R
