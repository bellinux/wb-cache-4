Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E
5|$|Alston is also {{credited}} with helping {{to break down}} <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> for female sports journalists. On October 1, 1974, after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros to clinch the NL Pennant at the Houston Astrodome, he invited Anita Martini to the post-game press conference in the locker room. She became the first female journalist allowed in any major league locker room.|$|E
50|$|Without {{sediment}} supply {{erosion of}} <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is rapid as normal {{processes such as}} washover continue. This happens when waves hit <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> and push sediment from the ocean side to the lagoon side, there is no incoming sediment on the ocean side to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>barrier.</b> This means that <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> migrate landward as <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> ridges are reworked. The ratio of fine to coarse sediments making up <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is also increased. The coarse sediments armour <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> structure against ocean swell and wind waves, without this sediment the fines are much more vulnerable to being removed leaving <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> structure more vulnerable. Maximum wave height for this section of coast during one October {{was found to be}} 6.3 metres, and other studies have recorded frequent breakers around 5 metres high. This means that <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> would frequently have to deal with overtopping events.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Foss <b>Barrier</b> {{is built}} {{across the river}} near its mouth at Castle Mills. When closed, it {{prevents}} floodwater from the River Ouse forcing {{the flow of the}} Foss back on itself. When the river Ouse reaches a level of 7.4m above ordnance datum, the staff at <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> are alerted. When the level reaches 7.8m AOD <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is then lowered, after running pumps for several minutes to clear silt and debris from the river bed. This provides a watertight fit. It takes four minutes to lower <b>the</b> <b>barrier.</b> To avoid <b>the</b> build-up of water behind <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> causing <b>the</b> Foss to burst its banks, the water is pumped around <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> and into <b>the</b> Ouse. This is done by eight pumps that pump water at 30 tonnes per second, this prevents the Foss flowing back on itself. The water pumped out should maintain a water level of 6.5m AOD behind <b>the</b> <b>barrier.</b> When <b>the</b> two sides of <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> are equalised, <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is raised.|$|R

5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} beside <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> of {{the circuit}} on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into the pit lane {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to the pit lane on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to pass him. Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced wide in avoidance. Later on Alesi collided with Diniz and struck <b>the</b> <b>barriers,</b> having lost his car's two left wheels. The safety car was once again deployed as carbon fibre was scattered across the grass.|$|E

5|$|Following the Monaco Grand Prix on 4 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6–8 June {{to prepare for}} the Canadian Grand Prix. Barrichello set the first day's fastest times, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Testing was halted when Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively. Häkkinen was fastest on the second day. BAR's Ricardo Zonta lost control of his car and crashed into <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> at the Parabolica corner, limiting his testing time as repairs were made to his car. Jenson Button for Williams was quickest on the third day. Ferrari undertook additional testing at their private facility, the Fiorano Circuit, with their test driver Luca Badoer who performed practice pit stops and starts, utilising different car set-ups, testing new car components and ran on an artificially wet track.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session.

5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{made it a}} clean {{sweep of}} fastest times in {{practice}} on Saturday morning, setting a time of 1:30.904, again less than {{a tenth of a}} second ahead of Rosberg. The session started in wet conditions following a rain shower thirty minutes before it commenced. It was interrupted with 22 minutes to go, after Marcus Ericsson crashed heavily at the exit of Stowe corner. With the car cleared from the track, lengthy repair work at <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> followed, leaving just five minutes of running when practice was restarted. The drivers then set their fastest times of the session. Again, it were the Red Bull drivers closest to the Mercedes, with Ricciardo ahead of Verstappen in third, both about half a second off Hamilton's time. Ericsson was sent to hospital for tests following his accident and received a five-place grid penalty since his gearbox had to be changed. Vettel received the same penalty after his gearbox failed {{towards the end of the}} third practice session.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{made his}} pit stop shortly thereafter, {{putting on the}} soft {{compound}} tyre, while Hamilton stayed out. In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third place, right behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton came into the pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come out behind both Red Bull drivers. More trouble was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, {{who was in the}} lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> after his rear right tyre had exploded.

40|$|Humans can {{recognize}} and navigate {{in a room}} when its contents have been rearranged. Rats also adapt rapidly to movements of objects in a familiar environment.

We recorded from single CA 1 pyramidal cells as rats foraged for food in a cylindrical arena (the room) containing a tall <b>barrier</b> (<b>the</b> furniture). Our main finding is {{a new class of}} cells that signal proximity to <b>the</b> <b>barrier.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is fixed in position, these cells appear to be ordinary place cells. When, however, <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is moved, their activity moves equally and thereby conveys information about <b>the</b> <b>barrier's</b> position relative to the arena. When <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is removed, such cells stop firing, further suggesting they represent <b>the</b> <b>barrier.</b> Finally, if <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> is put into a different arena where place cell activity is changed beyond recognition (“remapping”), these cells continue to discharge at <b>the</b> <b>barrier.</b> We also saw, in addition to barrier cells and place cells, a small number of cells whose activity seemed to require <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> to be in a specific place in the environment. We conclude that <b>barrier</b> cells represent <b>the</b> location of <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> in an environment-specific, place cell framework.

Since each day in the tz'olkin had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the haab, producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by Mayanists as the Calendar Round.

40|$|The {{electron}} velocity distribution function (EVDF) of electron swarms in N 2 has a constricted part at an electron energy of around 2 - 3 eV.

In order to investigate <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> effect in detail further, we simulated the electron behaviour around the energy range of <b>the</b> <b>barrier.</b> We found that momentum transfer collisions {{also contribute to}} <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> effect in collaboration with vibrational excitation.
