25|$|Eleven batsmen {{averaged}} over 40 in the series, {{the most}} in an Ashes series in Australia since <b>the</b> <b>timeless</b> Tests of 1928–29 when twelve batsmen achieved this feat. It has not been equalled since, though ten batsmen averaged over 40 in 2002–03. Bill Lawry's 592 runs (84.57) was {{the most in}} an Ashes series since Don Bradman's 680 runs (97.14) in 1946–47 and his three centuries were the most since Arthur Morris three in 1948.|$|E

25|$|His play The Skin of Our Teeth {{opened in}} New York on November 18, 1942, {{featuring}} Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead. Again, the themes are familiar – <b>the</b> <b>timeless</b> human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the alternate history of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake, {{that much of}} the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from James Joyce's last work.|$|E

25|$|Having {{been sent}} to Skegness to restore his health, he responded with a marvellous season in 1936. His 12 for 52 against the strong Surrey batting side on an admittedly damaged pitch was his finest feat. In all, he took 140 wickets for less than 13 runs each in the County Championship, and was chosen for the Ashes tour {{at the end of}} the season. Though he headed the averages for all matches, Copson's body was not {{resilient}} enough for <b>the</b> <b>timeless</b> matches on rock-hard Australian pitches, and he did not play in any of the Tests.|$|E
25|$|Into the 21st century {{abstraction}} {{remains very}} much in view, its main themes: the transcendental, the contemplative and <b>the</b> <b>timeless</b> are exemplified by Barnett Newman, John McLaughlin, and Agnes Martin as well as younger living artists. Art as Object {{as seen in the}} Minimalist sculpture of Donald Judd and the paintings of Frank Stella are still seen today in newer permutations. The poetic, Lyrical Abstraction and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as Robert Motherwell, Patrick Heron, Kenneth Noland, Sam Francis, Cy Twombly, Richard Diebenkorn, Helen Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell, among others.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 New York Public Radio's The Jerome L. Greene Performance Space premiered The Invisible Man a {{multimedia}} audio play written by Arthur Yorinks. The play takes place during {{one evening in}} a contemporary New York City homeless shelter and in its minimalist fashion, speaks to not only the timely subject of homelessness and abandonment, but to <b>the</b> <b>timeless</b> and tragic existential human condition of invisibility. A collage of sound, live voices, and sound effects was joined by a never-before-heard original piano score composed and improvised by Michael Riesman, director of the Philip Glass Ensemble, in a rare live musical performance. Lighting, video, and conceptual design were by Mark Stanley, resident lighting designer for The New York City Ballet. Arthur Yorinks directed.|$|E

From 1999, when Marceau returned with his classic solo show to New York and San Francisco after 15-year absences for critically acclaimed sold-out runs, his career in America enjoyed a remarkable renaissance with strong appeal to a third generation. He latterly appeared to overwhelming acclaim for extended engagements at such legendary American theaters as The Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>timeless</b> appeal {{of the work and}} the mastery of this unique artist.|$|E
25|$|The Sikh gurus {{established}} a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react {{as a community}} to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, {{was responsible for the}} creation of the concept of Akal Takht (throne of <b>the</b> <b>timeless</b> one), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the Harmandir Sahib. The Sarbat Ḵẖālsā (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Hola Mohalla and when {{there is a need to}} discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A gurmatā (literally, guru's intention) is an order passed by the Sarbat Ḵẖālsā in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs. The term hukamnāmā (literally, edict or royal order) is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā. However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which is a given order to Sikhs.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1891 Schiller had {{independently}} reached a doctrine {{very similar to}} William James' Will to Believe. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down <b>the</b> <b>timeless,</b> perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation {{is to make the}} same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.|$|E
