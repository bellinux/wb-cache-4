The change to the section is masked by the presence of four large pinnacles which rise from the corners at this point, as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> on the buttresses but are in line with the tower itself. Behind the pinnacles, once again Blacket has placed an encircling battlement which appears to mark the point where the tower ceases to be tower and becomes spire, or vice versa. Harmonious with the four crocketed pinnacles, and on the same level, are little dormer windows.|$|E
500|$|When William Acton ran {{the jail}} in the 1720s, the income from charities, {{collected}} {{to buy food}} for inmates on the common side, was directed instead {{to a group of}} trusted prisoners who policed the prison on Acton's behalf.

In response, noting that public inquiries had failed to stop construction, they decided to gather support. In May 1992, environmental organisations attempted to take Department for Transport to the High Court, stating that the road was against the government's own environmental protection laws. The European Commission dropped the case that August.

500|$|Nimoy {{approached}} ILM {{early in}} development and helped create storyboards for the optical effects sequences. Many shots used matte paintings to extend backgrounds and create establishing shots without {{the cost of}} building a set. Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real—while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion, Evans said that photographers would [...] "shoot things that [...] are odd in some way" [...] and end up with results that look natural instead. The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department, who had to make it feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco. The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided design input. The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent, and filmed them on a large area of smooth concrete runway at the Oakland Airport. Elements like a shuttlecraft that thirty extras appeared to interact with were also mattes blended to appear as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> by the actors. Ultimately the artists were not satisfied with how the shot turned out; matte photography supervisor Craig Barron believed that there were too many elements in the scene.|$|E

The reining hand should be bent at the elbow, held close to the rider's side, and centered over the horse's neck, usually within an inch of the saddle horn. Due to the presence of the saddle horn, a true straight line between rider's hand and horse's mouth is usually not possible. Common faults of western riders include slouching, hands that are too high or too low, and poor position, particularly a tendency to sit on the horse as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in a chair, with their feet stuck too far forward.

2500|$|Nakhchivan {{became a}} scene of {{conflict}} during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. On May 4, 1992, Armenian forces shelled the raion of Sadarak. The Armenians claimed that the attack {{was in response to}} cross-border shelling of Armenian villages by Azeri forces from Nakhchivan. David Zadoyan, a 42-year-old Armenian physicist and mayor of the region, said that the Armenians lost patience after months of firing by the Azeris. [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> on our hilltops and harassing us with gunfire, what do you think our response should be?" [...] he asked. The government of Nakhchivan denied these charges and instead asserted that the Armenian assault was unprovoked and specifically targeted the site of a bridge between Turkey and Nakhchivan.

2500|$|At 19:20 that night, a major {{air attack}} began while {{the task force}} was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, {{parachute}} flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she {{was hit by a}} torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers' mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> on a couch that apparently absorbed the shock of the explosion. Settling [...] by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated steering unit was quickly devised, and Lexington made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December. She reached Bremerton, Washington, on December 22 for full repairs, completed on February 20, 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan's Tokyo Rose, the first of several such assertions.|$|E

After it was rejected by 37 publishers he rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who [...] "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with Roger Ebert, for example, stating [...] "there is, in short, nothing I liked about My Life in Ruins, except some of the ruins" [...] and calling Reiss' script [...] "lousy".
