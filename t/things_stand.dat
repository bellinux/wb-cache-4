25|$|The {{demotion}} {{is bound}} to concentrate Dalziel's mind on whether she should run for the Christchurch mayoralty. As <b>things</b> <b>stand,</b> a place for her in a Labour cabinet as minister for the earthquake recovery looks unlikely, but {{she would be a}} strong candidate for mayor.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>things</b> <b>stand</b> {{now this}} brings {{the process to}} another impasse. To avoid it some {{definition}} of what happens after a shelf agreement is needed. One possible idea by this essay is to agree ahead of time that following attainment of a final status agreement {{there will be a}} negotiated detailed and staged implementation agreement which would define a process which would allow the creation of a stable functional Palestinian state in stages and over time. In Aug 2013 an indication that such an idea can be acceptable to the Palestinians was given by Mahmud Abbas in a meeting with Meretz MK-s. [...] In the meeting Abbas stated [...] "that there cannot be an interim agreement but only a final status deal that can be implemented in stages".|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{concern that the}} {{conflict}} between those who seek renewed utilisation of whales and those who seek protection for every whale has placed a dangerous strain on the IWC. Oran Young and eight other noted scholars in the field assert that [...] "changes in the current [...] arrangements are inevitable" [...] and that [...] "the killing of whales for human consumption will continue, whether whalers operate within a reconstructed international whaling regime, opt to join alternative arrangements like NAMMCO, or seek to establish a hybrid system". The BBC also reports that [...] "onservationists argue that the IWC should be devoting far more of its attention to issues such as whales being hit by ships, the effects of pollution and climate change, and the pressures that drive species such as the baiji (or Yangtse river dolphin) to extinction. As <b>things</b> <b>stand,</b> it cannot. The logjam of hunting has to be overcome first." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2016 feature via The Quietus, Kavus Torabi {{shed light}} on several past, present, and future Cardiacs projects. [...] It was an {{extraordinarily}} interesting and brilliant time for me because we’d already talked {{a great deal about}} what the plan was {{for the next few years}} for Cardiacs. We were going to make a film. Tim and I were planning out loads of treatments and scripts. Tim wanted to share the burden of Cardiacs a bit with someone and I was more than happy to do that. The way <b>things</b> <b>stand,</b> [...] is nearly done but needs vocals and eyebrows and some of them need a few other touches. What there is does sound great but there’s far more stuff completed that hasn’t come out yet, that needs to come out. Tim is a perfectionist, and rightly so. Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 September 2016, Prime Minister Turnbull {{introduced}} into the House the Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016, the bill to create the plebiscite. Under {{the provisions of the}} legislation, Australian voters would be required to write either [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] in answer to the question [...] "Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?" [...] Additionally, $15 million of taxpayer funding will be equally distributed to the official [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no" [...] campaigns. If passed by the parliament, the plebiscite would be held on 11 February 2017. On 11 October 2016, the Labor Opposition announced it had officially resolved to oppose the plebiscite legislation, meaning that as <b>things</b> <b>stand,</b> the legislation lacks majority support in the Senate and the plebiscite will not go ahead. Debate on the Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016 was held in the House between 11–20 October, until the Government moved to end debate on the second reading and move for a vote. The bill passed the House 76–67 votes and moved to the Senate. Debate on the bill was held in the Senate throughout the day and evening of 7 November. The bill was defeated in the Senate at the second reading stage by 33 votes to 29. Following the result in the Senate, Prime Minister Turnbull stated the government had [...] "no plans to take any other measures on this issue".|$|E
