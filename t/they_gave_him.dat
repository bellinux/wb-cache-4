5|$|Unknown to Karman, {{both men}} were PKI members and intent on making him join the party. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> {{communist}} pamphlets and indoctrinated him in Party philosophy. When Karman was late in telling Rifah his feelings, losing her to another man, the PKI manipulated his emotions to make him leave Islam and hate Haji Bakir. Ultimately this was successful: Karman abandoned his mandatory prayers and began to espouse the Party's politics. After Karman was refused marriage to Rifah a second time, following her husband's death, he had Haji Bakir imprisoned. In this time Karman married Marni, intending to convert her family to communism.|$|E
5|$|Born in Enfield, London, Boucaud {{joined the}} youth system at Queens Park Rangers in 2000 {{and after the}} club lost their Academy status {{he moved to the}} Reading youth system towards the end of 2001. After {{breaking}} into Reading's reserve team, he signed a professional contract with the club on 25 March 2002 that contracted him at the club until the summer of 2004. Boucaud was pursued by Premier League club Arsenal, but stayed with Reading as <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a three-year contract. He was loaned out to Second Division club Peterborough United {{until the end of the}} 2002–03 season on 27 March 2003 and he made his debut two days later as an 85th minute substitute in a 5–1 victory away to Mansfield Town. He finished the season with six appearances for Peterborough.|$|E

5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. For a few minutes Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E
5|$|In Kinkladze's {{first season}} at the club, Dinamo won a league and cup double. However, due to the ongoing Georgian Civil War, during 1993 the Dinamo Tbilisi {{management}} sought to put their players in a more stable environment. As part of this, Kinkladze was sent on loan to 1. FC Saarbrücken in Germany. Kinkladze made his Saarbrücken debut in a 2. Bundesliga match against Tennis Borussia Berlin, a 2–2 draw on 4 March 1994. He was unable to settle into the side at Saarbrücken, rarely playing a full 90 minutes, and was sent off in a 1–3 defeat to Hertha Berlin. At {{the end of the}} season, Kinkladze returned to Tbilisi to resume his career in Georgia, where he was named the national Player of the Year for 1993. Dinamo president Merab Jordania was still uncomfortable with Kinkladze playing in Georgia amid political instability, and offered the player to Atlético Madrid for approximately £200,000; <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a trial, but no contract. He then trained with Real Madrid's reserves, where he caught the eye of Boca Juniors scouts, who took him to Argentina for a month's loan. Kinkladze met his childhood hero Diego Maradona, but did not gain a permanent contract, as manager Silvio Marzolini regarded him as too similar to Boca's Argentine international playmaker Alberto Márcico.|$|E

25|$|Sehul first enters {{history as}} having {{played a part}} in some of the {{difficulties}} that were experienced by the delegation sent to Cairo to obtain a new Abuna (bishop) for the empire in 1745. On their outbound trip, the party had been held up at Massawa by the local Naib for six months, and only released them after <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> half of their funds. On the return trip, Abuna Yohannes was held for ransom at Arqiqo until the abbot of the monastery of Debre Bizen helped him to escape. This affront was too serious to be overlooked, and the then Dejazmach Mikael was subjected to a punitive campaign by the Emperor Iyasu II. However Dejazmach Mikael remained too powerful, and he was soon forgiven.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like {{a breath of fresh}} air – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach to each of the students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> constant tasks to listen to and write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate the words for his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E
25|$|Sun Hao {{turned out}} to be a cruel and superstitious tyrant. His {{subjects}} were hesitant in attempting to persuade him to mend his ways, but due to Teng Mu's honoured status, they often asked Teng Mu to help them present their proposals to Sun Hao because the emperor might be offended if <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> advice directly. Sun Hao eventually grew tired of Teng Mu's suggestions and Empress Teng fell out of her husband's favour as a consequence. In 266, Sun Hao suddenly ordered Teng Mu to move to Cangwu (蒼梧; in present-day Wuzhou, Guangxi) — effectively sending the latter into exile — even though he did not strip the latter of his titles. Teng Mu died of distress on the journey to Cangwu. Sun Hao considered deposing Empress Teng as well but his superstitious beliefs worked in the empress's favour — his sorcerers (whom he trusted) told him that replacing the empress would lead to disaster for him. Sun Hao's mother, Empress Dowager He, also intervened by protecting and speaking up for Empress Teng. Empress Teng lived with her mother-in-law and rarely saw Sun Hao again but retained her authority as the empress. At the same time, Sun Hao gave empress signets to many of his other concubines.|$|E

25|$|Even in the non-international tour matches, Lawry's {{team could}} not escape controversy. The next match against South Zone at Bangalore {{generated}} more allegations of cheating. Australia's reserve wicketkeeper Ray Jordon claimed that Alan Connolly had bowled Prasanna. Prasanna disagreed but eventually walked after Jordon repeatedly insisted that he was out. The Australians then had an altercation {{in the dressing room}} after some members accused Jordon of cheating, asserting that the delivery had missed the stumps. Lawry scored 120 in the first innings, his only century of the tour, as his colleagues collapsed to be all out for 195. This gave South a 44-run lead and they declared at 6/255 on the final day. Australia needed to bat for only two hours on the final day to salvage a draw, but a collapse had them at 8/90 with an hour left with Lawry still at the crease. Gleeson came out to bat and talked with both umpires at length before taking guard; he later claimed to teammates that he had threatened to hit the umpires in the head if <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> out. Gleeson then padded every ball away without attempting a shot, but every leg before wicket appeal was rejected. In an attempt to waste time, Lawry pulled away from the wicket when a woman in a colourful sari walked into front of the sightscreen, leading to allegations that he had insulted Indian womanhood. In any case, the crowd expressed dismay at the Australian tactics by rioting and throwing rocks at the players. The match ended early because of the crowd trouble and Australia avoided being the first international team to lose to an Indian zone.|$|E
