The defects are produced in the semiconductor near-surface regions during heterostructure formation and further heat treatment. The correlation between the physico-chemical interactions at contact interfaces and the contact electrophysical parameters occurs through these defects.

For example, carbon fibers are commonly used in aluminium matrix to synthesize composites showing low density and high strength.

5000|$|Over {{the years}} newer and tougher {{composites}} have been developed, giving {{about five times}} the protection value of the original pure ceramics, the best of which were again about five times as effective as a steel plate of equal weight. These are often a mixture of several ceramic materials, or metal matrix composites which combine ceramic compounds within a metal matrix. The latest developments involve the use of carbon nanotubes to improve toughness even further. Commercially produced or researched ceramics for such type of armour include boron carbide, silicon carbide, aluminium oxide (sapphire or [...] "alumina"), aluminium nitride, <b>titanium</b> <b>boride</b> and Syndite, a synthetic diamond composite. Of these boron carbide is the hardest and lightest, but also the most expensive and brittle. Boron carbide composites are today favoured for ceramic plates protecting against smaller projectiles, such as used in body armour and armoured helicopters; this was in fact in the early sixties the first general application of ceramic armour. Silicon carbide, better suited to protect against larger projectiles, {{was at that time}} only used in some prototype land vehicles, such as the MBT-70. The ceramics can be created by pressureless sintering or hot pressing. A high density is required, so residual porosity must be minimised in the final part.|$|E
5000|$|Refractory {{carbides}} like {{titanium carbide}} and borides like <b>titanium</b> <b>boride</b> and zirconium boride can evaporate without undergoing decomposition in the vapor phase. These compounds are deposited by direct evaporation. In this process these compounds, compacted {{in the form}} of an ingot, are evaporated in vacuum by the focused high-energy electron beam, and the vapors are directly condensed over the substrate. [...] Certain refractory oxides and carbides undergo fragmentation during their evaporation by the electron beam, resulting in a stoichiometry that is different from the initial material. For example, alumina, when evaporated by electron beam, dissociates into aluminum, AlO3 and Al2O. Some refractory carbides like silicon carbide and tungsten carbide decompose upon heating, and the dissociated elements have different volatilities. These compounds can be deposited on the substrate either by reactive evaporation or by co-evaporation. In the reactive evaporation process, the metal is evaporated from the ingot by the electron beam. The vapors are carried by the reactive gas, which is oxygen in case of metal oxides or acetylene in case of metal carbides. When the thermodynamic conditions are met, the vapors react with the gas in the vicinity of the substrate to form films. Metal carbide films can also be deposited by co-evaporation. In this process, two ingots are used, one for metal and the other for carbon. Each ingot is heated with a different beam energy so that their evaporation rate can be controlled. As the vapors arrive at the surface, they chemically combine under proper thermodynamic conditions to form a metal carbide film.|$|E

40|$|In this study, <b>titanium</b> <b>borides</b> {{reinforced}} Ti- 6 Al- 4 V composites {{have been}} successfully prepared by hot isostatic pressing (HIPing). The microstructure of the as-fabricated samples was investigated using X-ray diffraction technique, secondary electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction and the mechanical properties evaluated through micro-hardness and wear resistance measurements together with nano-indentation. It was found that during HIPing the additive particles TiB 2 have transformed into TiB needles which tend to decorate at prior particle boundaries of the consolidated powder particles to form a network structure. Under the same HIPing condition, the needles became increasingly coarser and agglomerated with increased addition of TiB 2. The micro-hardness of the synthesized materials increased with increased volume fraction of TiB.

During directional solidification, α (AlMnSi) particles nucleate ahead of the planar solidification front and are pushed and later engulfed by the interface forming a banded particle layer structure. The presence of fine <b>titanium</b> <b>boride</b> particles (clusters) {{in front of the}} growing α (AlMnSi) particles makes the interaction between the intermetallic α (AlMnSi) particles and solidification front much more complex than most proposed models for particle/interface interactions.

40|$|Basic aim of {{the present}} {{doctorate}} thesis is the production of alloyed coatings {{on the surface of}} different types of steel, using the plasma - transferred arc (PTA) welding technique. In particular, while trying to nitride these coatings, we found the best welding parameters for the PTA technique. Additionally, the already nitrided coatings were reinforced with hard TiB 2 particles, so as to increase both their anti-friction and anti-corrosive behavior. Firstly, the production of four different coatings on the surface of carbon steel is achieved by using TiB 2 and B powder. According to the microstructure study, the coatings’ microstructure consists of proeutectic <b>titanium</b> <b>borides,</b> which are uniformly spread all over the eutectic matrix of ferrite and eutectic borides. The addition of boron to the coating leads to increased hardness, due to the simultaneous existence of FeB and TiB 2. Finally, by using a pin-on-disk apparatus with a ball of tool steel or Al 2 O 3 revealed that the %wt of free B in the coatings affected their tribological behaviour. Especially, an increase of B led to a decrease of the wear rate. Next, following the microstructure study of the Fe - Cr - N coatings, their anti-corrosive properties are described and studied extensively. The basic aim was to be found if it was possible for a carbon steel to absorb nitrogen, since it is known that the solubility of nitrogen in this type of steel is very low. The experiments showed that an increase of the %wt of chromium on the surface of a carbon steel led to an easier and smoother absorption of the nitrogen contained in the shielding gas. The percentage of austenite increased proportionally with the increase in chromium and nitrogen percentage. The existence of chromium nitrides or sigma - phase deteriorated the anti-corrosive behavior of the produced coatings, since chromium did not spread uniformly through the whole matrix. In a next step, the production of coatings with 100 % austenitic microstructure and with low nickel content is described. Especially, the nitrogen of the shielding gas substituted the nickel in the crystal lattice. The examination of these coatings using X - Ray Diffraction technique proved that their microstructure was indeed 100 % austenitic. Moreover, the nitrides existed only in the coatings with the highest chromium content and with other alloying elements (Mn, Mo). Once again, the produced nitrides and sigma - phase deteriorated the anti-corrosive behaviour of the produced coatings. Moreover, the production of a coating with super-austenitic microstructure on the surface of an austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L is thoroughly studied. The chemical composition of this coating was the following: 24 % Cr, 18 % Ni, 5 % Mo and 0, 4 % N (the rest was the %wt Fe). The electrochemical and chemical corrosion experiments proved that this coating has a better anti-corrosive behavior compared to that of the AISI 316 L substrate and slightly worse comparing to that of a super-austenitic material used as reference. In the final Chapter, there is a description of the production of a coating using pure TiB 2 powder and nitrogen from the shielding gas, in order to study its microstructure and its anti-corrosive behaviour. As it is widely known, the existence of titanium nitrides or carbonitrides in a metal matrix leads to increased anti-corrosive and anti-friction behaviour. Following this study, there is a comparison between the produced coating and the coating with pure TiB 2, regarding their anti-corrosive and anti-friction behaviour. ...|$|R
