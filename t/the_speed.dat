5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light.|$|E
5|$|The {{interference}} pattern {{between the two}} beams when the light is recombined at the observer depends upon the transit times over the two paths, {{and can be used}} to calculate <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light as a function of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of the water.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} specifies how speed ratings {{should be}} {{reported by the}} camera. If <b>the</b> noise-based <b>speed</b> (40:1) is higher than <b>the</b> saturation-based <b>speed,</b> <b>the</b> noise-based <b>speed</b> should be reported, rounded downwards to a standard value (e.g. 200, 250, 320, or 400). The rationale is that exposure according to <b>the</b> lower saturation-based <b>speed</b> would not result in a visibly better image. In addition, an exposure latitude can be specified, ranging from <b>the</b> saturation-based <b>speed</b> to <b>the</b> 10:1 noise-based <b>speed.</b> If <b>the</b> noise-based <b>speed</b> (40:1) is lower than <b>the</b> saturation-based <b>speed,</b> or undefined because of high noise, <b>the</b> saturation-based <b>speed</b> is specified, rounded upwards to a standard value, because using <b>the</b> noise-based <b>speed</b> would lead to overexposed images.

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light, from an observer's {{point of view}} its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> of an electron can approach, but never reach, <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of photons.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the double-clutch {{technique}} is to aid in matching <b>the</b> rotational <b>speed</b> of <b>the</b> input shaft being driven by the engine to <b>the</b> rotational <b>speed</b> of <b>the</b> gear the driver wishes to select (directly connected to rotating wheels). When <b>the</b> <b>speeds</b> are matched, <b>the</b> gear will engage smoothly and no clutch is required. If <b>the</b> <b>speeds</b> are not matched, the dog teeth on the collar will [...] "clash" [...] or grate {{as they attempt to}} fit into the holes on the desired gear. A modern synchromesh gearbox accomplishes this synchronization more efficiently. However, when <b>the</b> engine <b>speed</b> is significantly different from <b>the</b> transmission <b>speed,</b> <b>the</b> desired gear can often not be engaged even in a fully synchronized gearbox.

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light is much faster than <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of sound.|$|E
