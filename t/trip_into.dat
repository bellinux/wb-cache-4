5|$|In 1923, Braunschweigs {{bridge was}} rebuilt and enlarged. The year {{followed}} the same pattern as the previous one, with visits to foreign ports in July; Braunschweig stopped in Helsinki, Finland and Gothenburg, Sweden during her trip. Joint maneuvers were held again in August and September, after which Püllen left the ship. On 15 October, VAdm Hans Zenker, then the Oberbefehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte (O.d.SCommander of Naval Forces), reorganized the fleet structure, disbanding the North Sea and Baltic commands and replacing them with organizations based on ship type. Braunschweig was now assigned to the Linienschiffsdivision (Battleship Division), where she served as Zenker's flagship. The division also included the battleship Hannover. In February and March 1924, the ship served as an icebreaker in the Baltic. The usual cruise abroad in July 1924 ventured further than in previous years, with a <b>trip</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic. Braunschweig stopped in A Coruña from 6 to 13 July. Fleet maneuvers followed {{at the end of}} August, and at their conclusion, the fleet anchored off Sassnitz for a naval review for Admiral Paul Behncke, the retiring Chef der Admiralität (Chief of the Admiralty). Zenker was promoted to replace Behncke, who was in turn replaced by now-VAdm Mommsen, who again made Braunschweig his flagship. Further exercises were held from 29 September to 5 October.|$|E
