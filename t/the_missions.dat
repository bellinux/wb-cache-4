5|$|Many Indians {{who joined}} <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> {{were looking for}} {{protection}} from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores. In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities {{in harmony with the}} paradise where they had encountered the indigenous peoples.|$|E

5|$|In 1762, missionaries {{established}} two unauthorized missions {{south of}} San Sabá, in the Nueces River valley. For several years the Apache lived in <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> {{most of the}} year, but left in winter to hunt buffalo. One of <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> closed in 1763, when the Apache never returned from their hunt. The surviving mission closed in January 1766, after a force of 400natives from the northern tribes attacked, killing 6Apaches and taking 25captives {{as well as all}} the livestock in the valley. Forty-one Spanish troops and their small cannon ambushed the northern tribes as they returned to East Texas. Before the Spanish were forced to retreat, over 200Indians and 12Spanish soldiers died. After the battle, the Apache refused to return to the mission and returned to raiding near San Antonio. Raids by the northern tribes decreased, however.|$|E

50|$|This {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> has been {{explained}} by Christopher Anderson, {{who found that}} <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> was mostly used by the Wujalwujalwarra ‘mob’ of the Bloomfield River area, on whose land <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> stood. They incorporated the resources available at <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> into their social and economic life. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> provided a reliable source of food and tobacco, and material items, such as farm tools and blankets. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> was also used as a ‘caring centre’ where they could leave the elderly, ill and young.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Aguayo {{returned}} to Mexico, the new viceroy of New Spain, Juan de Acuña, marqués de Casafuerte, {{was ordered to}} cut costs accrued {{for the defense of}} {{the northern part of the}} territory. Acuña appointed Colonel Pedro de Rivera y Villalón to inspect the entire northern frontier. Beginning in what is now California in November 1724, Rivera spent the next three years inspecting the northern frontier, reaching San Antonio in August 1727. His reports of Los Adaes, Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto, and the presidio at San Antonio were favorable, but he was unimpressed with Presidio de los Tejas, whose 25soldiers were guarding empty missions. The native population had refused to congregate into communities around <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> and refused baptism unless they were on the brink of death. Because the Indians were well-armed, the Franciscans were unable to compel them to join <b>the</b> <b>missions.</b> The frustrated missionaries finally petitioned the Spanish government for 50soldiers to burn the Indians' houses of worship and force them to build homes near <b>the</b> <b>missions.</b> No troops were forthcoming.|$|E

5|$|The {{cooperative}} Spartan Ops mode originally {{began as}} a Firefight-type mode, similar to that featured in Halo: Reach, but was composed of different objective-oriented mission types. Over the course of development, changes were made to Spartan Ops to include a narrative that would tie Halo 4s multiplayer together. <b>The</b> <b>missions</b> were designed primarily for four player co-op. The Spartan Ops development team worked with the narrative team to use ideas and storylines to shape the mode such that the cinematics would tie in with <b>the</b> <b>missions.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1904 {{the name}} of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> was changed to <b>the</b> Central States <b>Mission.</b> In 1906 Samuel O. Bennion became {{president}} of <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> In that same year <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> headquarters were moved to Independence, Missouri.|$|R

50|$|The {{death of}} Ruatara on 15 March 1815 {{and the loss}} of his {{protection}} for <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> may have contributed to a lack of growth of European settlement in the area and its subsequent displacement, in the 1820s, by <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> at Kerikeri as <b>the</b> senior <b>mission</b> in New Zealand. By the 1830s the houses of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> at Oihi had deteriorated considerably and <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> was moved to Te Puna, further to the west in Rangihoua Bay. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> finally closed in the 1850s.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America {{was largely}} unexplored {{at the end}} of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored and founded eleven settlements in 76 years in the remote Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on the frontier of Spanish America. They built churches (templos) in a unique and distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> were taught European music as a means of conversion. <b>The</b> <b>missions</b> were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, and virtually autonomous from the Spanish crown.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Brood War is {{presented}} through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission, and conversations within <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> themselves, {{along with the}} use of cinematic cut scenes {{at the end of each}} campaign.

5|$|Born into a Fang family, Aubame was {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age. He {{was raised}} by the stepbrother of Léon M'ba, who became Aubame's chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon's first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. Aubame's quick rise in Gabonese politics was spurred by the support of <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> and administration, whereas much of M'ba's strength came from the colonists.|$|E

5|$|By 1851, {{however, the}} {{reduction}} system of <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> had disappeared. Mestizos {{who had moved}} to the area in their quest for land began to outnumber the original indigenous population. Starting with the creation of the Province of José Miguel de Velasco in 1880, the Chiquitania was split into five administrative divisions. With the rubber boom {{at the turn of the}} century, more settlers came to the areas and established large haciendas, moving the economic activities together with the native peoples out of the towns.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces is a first-person shooter (FPS). The player {{controls}} Kyle Katarn from a first-person perspective, with a {{focus on}} combat against various creatures and characters from the Star Wars universe, although the game also includes environmental puzzles and hazards. Dark Forces follows a central storyline outlined in mission briefings and cutscenes. Each mission includes specific objectives which are related to the story. <b>The</b> <b>missions</b> take place in a variety of environments across the Star Wars universe, including a Star Destroyer interior, Jabba the Hutt's space yacht, and the planet Coruscant, where the player must infiltrate a computer vault.|$|E
5|$|During the Campaign of Guayana, General Manuel Piar fights {{against the}} realists to seize <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> {{of the kingdom}} of Spain.

50|$|Mission San Francisco de Asís in 1845, had <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> lands sold off. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> {{quadrangle}} {{buildings and}} courtyard were sold or leased to businesses. <b>The</b> <b>Mission</b> was thus maintained and in 1857 returned.|$|R
50|$|In 1961 to {{make way}} for the boys' {{secondary}} school <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> was disbanded. <b>The</b> <b>Mission</b> Farm was cut into small parcels of land and distributed to <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> workers.

The Del Valle family moved into the former estancia buildings (near what is now Castaic).|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. program {{there were}} {{teething}} troubles.

Commando Hunt II (1 May through 31 October 1969), however, was thrown off track by phenomena that the Air Force could do absolutely nothing about. The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48inches of rain in July alone).|$|E
5|$|Four {{operational}} missions {{with the}} D-21B took {{place under the}} codename of Senior Bowl.

50|$|Like {{other units}} of the church, a {{leadership}} council is used to assist in governance of <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> Prior to April 2013, this was often called a zone leader council, consisting of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> president, assistants to <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> president and zone leaders. In April 2013 the zone leader council was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> leadership council, which adds <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> president's wife and sister training leaders, a new position consisting of sister missionaries called to give leadership to other sister missionaries.|$|R
50|$|Physical {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> complex began on August 6, 1797.

5|$|In 1892 Gaudí was {{commissioned}} by Claudio López Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions {{for the city of}} Tangier, in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaudí conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaudí deeply regretted the project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Família, in particular the design of the towers, with their paraboloid shape like those of <b>the</b> <b>Missions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the spiritual}} {{administration}} of <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> {{was given to}} German-speaking Franciscan missionaries.

As of , the churches not only serve the mestizo inhabitants of the villages but present spiritual centers for the few remaining indigenous peoples living in the periphery.|$|E
50|$|All missionaries {{serve in}} a <b>mission</b> under <b>the</b> {{direction}} of a mission president, who, like individual missionaries, is assigned by the LDS Church president. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> president must be a married high priest in the Melchizedek Priesthood; his wife is asked to serve alongside him.
