40|$|The {{presence}} of vacuum inside the cavity of a capacitive {{micromachined ultrasonic transducer}} (CMUT) causes the membrane of the device (which is the main vibrating structural component) to deflect towards the substrate, thereby causing {{a reduction in the}} effective gap height. This reduction causes a drastic decrease in the pull-in voltage of the device limiting the DC bias at which the device can be operated for maximum efficiency. In addition, this initial deflection of the membrane due to atmospheric pressure, causes significant stress stiffening of the the membrane, changing the natural frequency of the device significantly from the design value. To circumvent the deleterious effects of vacuum in the sealed cavity, we investigate the possibility of using sealed CMUT cavities with air inside at ambient pressure. In order to estimate the <b>transducer</b> <b>loss</b> due to the {{presence of}} air in the sealed cavity, we evaluate the resulting damping and determine the forces acting on the vibrating membrane resulting from the compression of the trapped air film. We take into account the flexure of the top vibrating membrane instead of assuming the motion to be parallel-plate like. Towards this end, we solve the linearized Reynolds equation using the appropriate boundary conditions and show that, for a sealed CMUT cavity, the presence of air does not cause any squeeze film damping...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Stepped {{exponential}} horns {{are proposed}} {{as a measure}} of acoustic impedance adaptation in an acoustic energy transfer (AET) system. Resonances due to impedance mismatches in the horn are used to obtain a maximal power throughput at a single frequency. Finite element (FE) models are used for optimisation of the horn parameters. Although experimental results do not match particularly well with simulations, the results still look promising. The horns boost the power transfer and efficiency for greater distances, {{which was one of the}} major problems in prior AET systems. The measured output power increased by a factor 3. 1 and the efficiency by a factor 7. 5 at a distance of 10 cm between the transmitter and the receiver. Discrepancies between the model and the measurements are expected to be largely due to variations in transducer parameters. The <b>transducer</b> <b>losses</b> were measured separately by means of impedance measurements in vacuum for improvement of the FE model...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a measurement set-up {{for determining the}} mechanical properties of porous materials at low and medium frequencies, by extending towards higher frequencies the quasistatic method based on a compression test. Indeed, classical quasi-static methods generally neglect the inertia effect of the porous sample and the coupling between the surrounding fluid and the frame: they are restricted to low fre- quency range (< 100 Hz) or specific sample shape. In the present method, the porous sample is placed in a cavity to avoid a lateral airflow. Then a specific electrodynamic ironless transducer is used to compress the sample. This highly linear transducer is used as actuator and sensor: the mechanical impedance of the porous sample is deduced from the measurement of the electrical impedance of the <b>transducer.</b> The <b>loss</b> factor and the Young's modulus of the porous material are estimated by inverse method based on the Biot's model.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} analysis {{based on}} the Johnson noise equation and an established transducer model has revealed a simple mathematical expression for the minimum signal force detectable in air with an open-circuit piezoelectric plate transducer operating in its thickness mode. A significant finding is that, except for any frequency dependence associated with a <b>transducer's</b> intrinsic <b>losses,</b> the minimum detectable signal force is independent of frequency. By contrast, the sensitivity (e. g. volts per unit signal force) {{is known to be}} a strong function of frequency, with the principal peak being at the plate's fundamental thickness resonance. The results are explained by showing that the new equation for minimum detectable force (MDF) is equivalent to the mechanical version of the Johnson noise equation. Both the Johnson noise equation and its mechanical equivalent are consistent with a generalized theory of thermal noise, which is sometimes referred to as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It is now evident that the mechanical equivalent of the Johnson noise equation provides a useful starting point from which many other device-specific MDF equations may be derived with relative ease. This approach is not restricted to piezoelectric transducers and can be applied regardless of whether the device is intended for operation in a solid, liquid or gaseous medium...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{piezoelectric}} energy harvesting, the harvesting efficiency can {{be greatly}} improved with the switching interface called synchronized switch harvesting on inductor. However, we found from experiments that, the voltage across the piezoelectric element reverses {{a little bit}} after every inversion. This reversion, although small compared to the inversion, weakens the inversion effect produced by the switching inductive shortcut, and therefore decreases the voltage magnitude {{as well as the}} harvesting efficiency a lot. This phenomenon can also be found from the experimental waveforms in the previous studies; but it has never been pointed out. In these studies, the analytical results, which used the measured effective inversion factor in calculation, agreed with experiments; yet, the origin of the reversion after every switching action, as well as the quantitative relation between the ideal and effective inversion factors are of interest. In this article, the phenomenon on voltage reversion after every inversion is first described. Based on the experimental results, it is analyzed that this reversion is caused by the <b>transducer</b> internal <b>loss.</b> A revised model con-sidering the influence of the internal energy loss is introduced. With this model, not only the reason, which causes the reversion after every inversion, can be explained; but also the quantitative relation between the ideal and effective inversion factors can be obtained. Experiments are also conducted to validate the revised model...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of label-free biosensors capable of accurately detecting trace contaminants, particularly small organic molecules, is of significant interest for applications in environmental monitoring. This {{is achieved by}} pairing a high-sensitivity signal transducer with a biorecognition element that imparts selectivity towards the compound of interest. However, many environmental pollutants do not have corresponding biorecognition elements. Fortunately, biomimetic chemistries, such as molecular imprinting, allow {{for the design of}} artificial receptors with very high selectivity for the target. Here, we perform a proof-of-concept study to show how artificial receptors may be created from inorganic silanes using the molecular imprinting technique and paired with high-sensitivity <b>transducers</b> without <b>loss</b> of device performance. Silica microsphere Whispering Gallery Mode optical microresonators are coated with a silica thin film templated by a small fluorescent dye, fluorescein isothiocyanate, which serves as our model target. Oxygen plasma degradation and solvent extraction of the template are compared. Extracted optical devices are interacted with the template molecule to confirm successful sorption of the template. Surface characterization is accomplished via fluorescence and optical microscopy, ellipsometry, optical profilometry, and contact angle measurements. The quality factors of the devices are measured to evaluate the impact of the coating on device sensitivity. The resulting devices show uniform surface coating with no microstructural damage with Q factors above 106.

2500|$|Medical {{ultrasonography}} uses ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) {{to visualize}} soft tissue {{structures in the}} body in real time. No ionizing radiation is involved, but {{the quality of the}} images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person (ultrasonographer) performing the exam and the patient's body size. Examinations of larger, overweight patients may have a decrease in image quality as their subcutaneous fat absorbs more of the sound waves. This results in fewer sound waves penetrating to organs and reflecting back to the <b>transducer,</b> resulting in <b>loss</b> of information and a poorer quality image. Ultrasound is also limited by its inability to image through air pockets (lungs, bowel loops) or bone. Its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years.

40|$|Equivalent {{circuits}} for piezoelectric {{devices and}} ultrasonic transmission media {{can be used}} to cosimulate electronics and ultrasound parts in simulators originally intended for electronics. To achieve efficient systemlevel optimization, it is important to simulate correct, absolute amplitude of the ultrasound signal in the system, as this determines the requirements on the electronics regarding dynamic range, circuit noise, and power consumption. This paper presents methods to achieve correct, absolute amplitude of an ultrasound signal in a simulation of a pulse-echo system using equivalent circuits. This is achieved by taking into consideration loss due to diffraction and the effect of the cable that connects the electronics and the piezoelectric <b>transducer.</b> The conductive <b>loss</b> in the transmission line that models the propagation media of the ultrasound pulse is used to model the loss due to diffraction. Results show that the simulated amplitude of the echo follows measured values well in both near and far fields, with an offset of about 10 %. The use of a coaxial cable introduces inductance and capacitance that affect the amplitude of a received echo. Amplitude variations of 60 % were observed when the cable length was varied between 0. 07 m and 2. 3 m, with simulations predicting similar variations. The high precision in the achieved results show that electronic design and system optimization can rely on system simulations alone. This will simplify the development of integrated electronics aimed at ultrasound systems. Validerad; 2007; 20070318 (jerker...|$|R

Each die has four delay-line detection channels, permitting simultaneous measurement of multiple analytes or for parallel detection of single analyte containing samples. Crucial to our biosensor was the development of a transducer that excites the shear horizontal (SH) mode, through optimization of the <b>transducer,</b> minimizing propagation <b>losses</b> and reducing undesirable modes. Detection was achieved by comparing the reference phase of an input signal to the phase shift from the biosensor using an integrated electronic multi-readout system connected to a laptop computer or PDA. The Love wave acoustic arrays were centered at 330 MHz, shifting to 325 - 328 MHz after application of the silicon dioxide waveguides.

40|$|Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) {{techniques}} {{have achieved a}} great development during the last decades as a valuable tool for material characterization, manufacturing control and structural integrity tests. Among these tools, the guided wave technology has been rapidly extended because it reduces inspection time and costs compared to the ordinary point by point testing in large structures, as well as because {{of the possibility of}} inspecting under insulation and coating conditions. This fast development has motivated the creation of several inspection and material characterization systems including different technologies which can be combined with this technique. Different measurements systems based on laser {{techniques have}} been presented in order to inspect pipes, plates and diverse structures. Many of them are experimental systems of high cost and complexity which combine the employment of a laser for generation of waves in the structure and an interferometer for detection. Some of them employ air-coupled ultrasound generation <b>transducers,</b> with high <b>losses</b> in air and which demand high energy for exciting waves in materials of high stiffness. The combined employment of a commercial vibrometer system for Lamb wave sensing in plates has been successfully shown in the literature. In this paper we present a measurement system based on the combined employment of a piezoelectric wedge transducer and a laser vibrometer to sense guided acoustic waves in carbon steel pipes. The measurement system here presented is mainly compounded of an angular wedge transducer, employed to generate the guided wave and a commercial laser vibrometer used in the detection process. The wedge transducer is excited by means of a signal function generator whose output signal has been amplified with a power signal amplifier. A high precision positioning system is employed to place the laser beam at different points through the pipe surface. The signal detected by the laser vibrometer system is amplified with a signal amplifier and then it is displayed in a digital storage oscilloscope. This set-up offers the possibility of analyzing in a simpler way the wave propagation and the material evaluation in pipes of certain wall thickness. The material characterization considering distinct wave propagation modes can be easily achieved, changing the different incident angles of the wedge piezoelectric probe and their combined employment with several driving signals. Moreover, this experimental sensing system offers other possibilities of inspecting and analyzing the wave propagation in some features (bends, flange joints, welds, [...] .) of the pipe surface which cause very large reflections and mode conversions and which in practice limits the inspection range when are inspected with conventional receiving transducer arrangements.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 60 - 64. All transducers used in airborne ultrasonic applications, including capacitive micromachined ultrasonic <b>transducers</b> (CMUTs), incorporate <b>loss</b> {{mechanisms to}} have reasonably wide frequency bandwidth. However, CMUTs can yield high efficiency in airborne applications and unlike other technologies, they offer wider bandwidth {{due to their}} low characteristic impedance, even for efficient designs. Despite these advantages, achieving the full potential is challenging {{due to the lack}} of a systematic method to design a wide bandwidth CMUTs. In this thesis, we present a method for airborne CMUT design. We use a lumped element circuit model and harmonic balance (HB) approach to optimize CMUTs for maximum transmitted power. Airborne CMUTs have narrowband characteristic at their mechanical part, due to low radiation impedance. In this work, we restrict the analysis to a single frequency and the transducer is driven by a sinusoidal voltage with half of the frequency of operation frequency, without any dc bias. We propose a new mode of airborne operation for CMUTs, where the plate motion spans the entire gap. We achieve this maximum swing at a specific frequency applying the lowest drive voltage and we call this mode of operation as Minimum Voltage Drive Mode (MVDM). We present equivalent circuit-based design fundamentals for airborne CMUT cells and verify the design targets by fabricated CMUTs. The performance limits for silicon membranes for airborne applications are derived. We experimentally obtain 78. 9 dB// 20 Pa@ 1 m source level at 73. 7 kHz, with a CMUT cell of radius 2. 05 mm driven by 71 V sinusoidal drive voltage at half the frequency. The measured quality factor is 120. CMUTs can achieve a large bandwidth (low quality factor level) as they can be manufactured to have thin plates. Low-quality-factor airborne CMUTs experience increased ambient pressure and therefore a larger membrane deflection. This effect increases the stiffness of the plate material and can be considered by nonlinear compliance in the circuit model. We study the interaction of the compliance nonlinearity and nonlinearity of transduction force and show that transduction overwhelms the compliance nonlinearity. To match the simulation results with the admittance measurements we implement a very accurate model-based characterization approach where we modify the equivalent circuit model. In the modified circuit model, we introduced new elements to include loss mechanisms. Also, we changed the dimension parameters used in the simulation to compensate the difference in the resonance frequency and amplitude. Yılmaz, AslıPh. D...|$|R
