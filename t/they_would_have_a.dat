5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds {{with some of his}} fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck. He said he opposed these measures because he believed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> negative impact on low income families and children.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Blues {{had been}} the only team to finish the pool stage of the Heineken Cup unbeaten during the 2008–09 season, which saw them given top seeding for the quarter-finals. This meant that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> home quarter-final against the second-best runners-up from the pool stage, Toulouse. Cardiff won the quarter-final 9–6.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (<b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hard time getting through {{a thick layer of}} fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E

5000|$|Norma McCorvey, [...] "Jane Roe" [...] in the {{landmark}} Roe v. Wade (1972) decision, {{in which the}} US Supreme Court ruled that women <b>had</b> <b>a</b> right to determine whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> abortion.|$|R
50|$|Some have L-shaped porches {{to protect}} against wind and rain; some {{particularly}} good examples {{are to be found}} at Grimspound. It is believed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> conical roof, supported by timbers and covered in turf or thatch.|$|R
5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, {{absentee ballot}}s were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
5|$|From 2005 to 2009, {{the series}} {{remained}} largely unmentioned, with the rights still fully belonging to Take-Two. In 2006, German-based Yager Development pitched a cover-based shooter to publisher 2K Games, who rejected the original concept of futuristic soldiers without Dubai as a setting. However, 2K offered {{them a chance}} to develop a reboot for the Spec Ops series, promising that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of creative freedom. Development began in early 2007, with most other fundamentals of the initial game intact. While the game is an installment in the Spec Ops series, the team chose to use new ideas and intentionally avoided using existing elements of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strained relationship {{for many years}} afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E
50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941, many nationalists in Ukraine thought that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to create an independent country once again. An entire Ukrainian volunteer division of the SS had been created.|$|R
50|$|The {{two stars}} <b>have</b> <b>an</b> angular {{separation}} of 5.030 arcseconds. As a binary star system, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> estimated orbital period {{of at least}} 19,500 years and a present-day separation of around 2,000 Astronomical Units. This system is roughly 12 million years old.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 2015, Barrett-Jackson {{announced}} {{that for the}} first time ever, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> auction in the Northeast at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut. The inaugural auction took place from June 23-26, 2016, with the auction block being located inside the Mohegan Sun Arena.|$|R
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
25|$|Just because {{thousands}} {{had managed}} to cross the English Channel safely did not mean <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> safe war. Children from Manchester had recently been evacuated to Canada, as that city was not considered safe, they were replaced by Channel Island children.|$|E

25|$|During 1958, {{his last}} year in Tibet, Chagdud Tulku was advised to marry {{in order to have}} a {{companion}} and helper in the unsettled times to come. He later wed Karma Drolma, the daughter of a wealthy landowner in Kongpo. Later, in exile in India, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son and a daughter, Jigme Tromge and Dawa Lhamo Tromge.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} that the Soviet intelligence had been, at a certain level, implicated in provoking the uprising. The Cheka, employing secret agents in local socialist circles, were well informed of the conspiracy and popular dissatisfaction of the Bolshevik rule. Instructed by Stalin and Ordzhonikidze, Beria and his superior, Kvantaliani, actually encouraged the rebellion so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretext for eliminating all political opposition and avenging personal scores with their former rivals in Georgia.|$|E
25|$|On 8 March 1942, {{the allies}} in the Dutch East Indies {{surrendered}} to the Japanese. Among the 32,500 soldiers taken prisoner, mostly Dutch, British, and Australian, were 534 members of the U.S. battalion, 21 men of the original 558 having been transferred and three killed in action. 99 of the American POWs were from E Battery which had been detached from {{the main body of}} the battalion. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different POW history than the others.|$|E
5000|$|Detectives {{investigating}} the robbery stated: [...] "They {{knew exactly what}} they were looking for and we suspect they already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> market for the jewels." [...] The suspects' details were circulated to all ports and airports but police believed <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> elaborately prepared escape route and had already left the country.|$|R
500|$|The then {{president}} Olusegun Obasanjo, acknowledged fraud and other electoral [...] "lapses" [...] {{but said the}} result reflected opinion polls. In a national television address in 2007, he added that if Nigerians {{did not like the}} victory of his handpicked successor, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to vote again in four years.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in herds. This is suggested by bonebed finds with the remains of many individuals of different ages. Like modern migratory herds, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant effect on their environment, as well as serving as a major food source for predators.|$|R
25|$|Hobens was {{appointed}} pro at Yountakah Country Club in Nutley, New Jersey, and Tom Anderson, Sr. {{took up a}} position ten miles away at Montclair Country Club. In April 1901, Hobens moved less than five miles to Glen Ridge Golf Club and George Thomson from North Berwick took over at Yountakah. In 1907 Hobens married an Irish girl, Delia Agnes Lally (1881–1969), and together <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> house full of children, eight in all. At {{the time of his}} marriage he changed his surname from Hoben to Hobens.|$|E
25|$|Roanoke Island {{was the key}} {{to control}} of the Sounds. If {{controlled}} by the Union forces, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> base that could be attacked only by an amphibious operation, which the Rebels could not mount. If the Union established naval superiority there, all points on the mainland shores would be equally vulnerable to assault. The Confederate defenders would be forced into an impossible situation: they would either have to give up some positions without a fight, or they would have to spread their assets too thin to be of any use.|$|E
25|$|The pirates' {{plan was}} to sail past the Swallow, which meant exposing {{themselves}} to one broadside. Once past, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good chance of escaping. However, the helmsman failed to keep the Royal Fortune on the right course, and the Swallow was able to approach to deliver a second broadside. Captain Roberts was killed by grapeshot, which struck him in the throat while {{he stood on the}} deck. Before his body could be captured by Ogle, Roberts's wish to be buried at sea was fulfilled by his crew, who weighed his body down and threw it overboard after wrapping it in his ship's sail. It was never found.|$|E
50|$|The Parliamentary {{commander}} {{set up his}} batteries at {{two points}} near the Duleek gate, {{on either side of}} St Mary's Church, where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interlocking field of fire. Having opened two breaches in the walls, one to the south the other to the east of the church, he called on the Royalists to surrender.|$|R
50|$|The {{by-election}} {{provoked a}} tough local debate, in which Wylfa Nuclear Power Station became a key issue. If Welsh Labour <b>had</b> won then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{majority in the}} Assembly. On 1 August 2013 Rhun gained 12,601 votes, {{more than three times}} the number of votes secured by the second-placed candidate Tal Michael (Labour), on a turnout of 42.45%.|$|R
50|$|However, on October 16, 2007, House {{opted to}} remain in {{operations}} by announcing {{he changed his mind}} and the Horsemen would be playing the 2008 season in arenafootball2, where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> in-state rivalry ("The War on I-64") with the Louisville Fire. With the move the Horsemen adopted new jerseys, that included a slight change in their blue color scheme.|$|R
25|$|The rites, ceremonies, {{and beliefs}} were kept secret and {{consistently}} preserved from antiquity. For the initiated, {{the rebirth of}} Persephone symbolized the eternity of life which flows from generation to generation, and they believed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reward in the afterlife. There are many paintings and pieces of pottery that depict {{various aspects of the}} Mysteries. Since the Mysteries involved visions and conjuring of an afterlife, some scholars believe that the power and longevity of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from psychedelic drugs. The name of the town, Eleusís, seems to be Pre-Greek and it is probably a counterpart with Elysium and the goddess Eileithyia.|$|E
25|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1739, both Britain and Spain {{expected}} that France would join the war on the Spanish side. This played {{a large role in}} the tactical calculations of the British. If the Spanish and French were to operate together, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> superiority of ninety ships of the line. In 1740, there was an invasion scare when it was believed that a French fleet at Brest and a Spanish fleet at Ferrol were about to combine and launch an invasion of England. Although this proved not to be the case, the British kept the bulk of their naval and land forces in southern England to act as a deterrent.|$|E
25|$|This was a {{tactical}} disadvantage for the GIGN; the positions {{were based on}} the aircraft being parked where the French authorities ordered the placement of the A300. When the aircraft moved, the GIGN had to quickly reorganise its forces. Favier placed snipers on the roof so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> view of the cockpit. He organised a cavalry charge of three passenger boarding stairs and thirty men to take over the aircraft. Favier planned to have two teams, each with 11 people, open the rear left and rear right doors of the A300. A third team of eight would open the front right door. The forces planned to isolate the cockpit, with Yahia, {{from the rest of the}} aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Anny - After 36 days, the Final Four were {{informed}} there wouldn't be anymore tribal councils. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> IC, {{the person who}} won this challenge {{would be one of}} the Final Two. Besides, this person should eliminate one of their tribemates immediately. Marlon won this challenge and he decided to eliminate Anny stating it was time for her to go.|$|R
50|$|Arsinoitheriidae is {{a family}} of extinct hoofed mammals {{belonging}} to the extinct order Embrithopoda. Remains {{have been found in}} the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Romania. When alive, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great, albeit very superficial, resemblance to the modern rhinoceros. Despite this, they were not closely related to rhinoceri (or any other perissodactyl), instead being more related to hyraxes, elephants, sirenians, and possibly desmostylians.|$|R
