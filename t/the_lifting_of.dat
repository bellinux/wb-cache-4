5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate was {{considering}} {{whether or not}} to prosecute WCRC.

40|$|AbstractTwo tandem {{flapping}} {{wings in}} viscous flow were modeled {{by using the}} immersed boundary method for exploration of the aerodynamics of dragonfly in hovering flight. Interaction between the forewing and the hindwing, {{and its effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> forces, were examined by varying the phase difference of the wing motions and the inter-distance of the two wings. Two vortex interaction modes were identified at different phase differences and inter-distances, which give rise to significant variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> forces. <b>The</b> first interaction mode increases <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewing and the second one enhances <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindwing.

5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting {{his office}} in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed {{as a sign of}} increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual labor of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|E

The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg {{delivered}} his maiden speech on 7 July, in a debate {{on the use of}} propaganda.

50|$|Spoilerons help to roll an {{aircraft}} by reducing <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> one wing, but, unlike ailerons, not by increasing <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other wing. As a side effect, a raised spoileron also increases the drag on one wing which causes the aircraft to yaw, {{which can be}} compensated with the rudder. Spoilerons {{can be used to}} assist the ailerons or replace them entirely, as in the B-52G which required an extra spoiler segment.|$|R
5|$|On 6 May, it was {{reported}} that The Jacobite season was likely to start late due to the suspension.

5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. <b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E

Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to the final against FC Barcelona. He came close to scoring the first goal, only for Mark Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United {{went on to win}} the game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13times in the First Division and 19times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the Football League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, several oil {{and natural}} gas rigs were {{evacuated}} due to the proximity of Earl. An estimated 10,000 workers were evacuated from both onshore and offshore rigs. The storm forced many Florida residences to evacuate, especially people living in the barrier islands along the Florida Gulf Coast. About 30 Air Force jets from Eglin Air Force Base were sent to Oklahoma to protect them from the storm. A mandatory evacuation was issued for 20,000 residents in Leon County as well as all barrier islands along the Florida coast due to the risk of substantial flooding. Franklin County was briefly under a mandatory evacuation order on September2, the reasons for <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the order are unknown.

5|$|On 7 August, a {{fleet of}} Persian rafts {{ferrying}} troops across the Bosphorus were surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from August 6 to the 7th also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over.

5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance {{of women on}} the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the ban after {{the founding of the}} Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E
5|$|The Split Agreement was {{a turning}} point in the Bosnian War as well as an {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the JNA barracks in Bjelovar also {{affected}} the ceasefire agreement reached between the JNA and Croatia in Igalo, specifically a provision regarding <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the blockade of the JNA barracks there.

A compromise interpretation was negotiated, only to be dropped by Kadijević specifically because of the events in Bjelovar. On 1 October, Kadijević issued an ultimatum to Croatia threatening destruction of one civilian facility vital to the Croatian population for each military post captured by the ZNG. The ultimatum demonstrated that the JNA considered Croatia enemy territory, rather than part of the country it had a responsibility to protect.|$|E
