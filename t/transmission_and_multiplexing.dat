Recently {{researchers}} at Hewlett-Packard have announced {{the discovery of}} a new material having resistance switching characteristics and which has been characterized as a fourth fundamental circuit component called the “memristor”[1].

We then present a distributed algorithm that emulates the centralized algorithm with a much lower overhead, and enhanced durability to faults. We prove that both algorithms produce identical layouts, thus showing the superiority of the latter algorithm.

40|$|A <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiplexing</b> {{strategy}} {{appropriate for}} voice over {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM), called delayed frame queueing (DFQ), is proposed. This frame-based strategy has features {{in common with the}} synchronous transfer mode and is thus well suited to service synchronous applications such as voice, while retaining the statistical multiplexing capabilities of ATM. In particular, the DFQ service discipline can provide explicit and nontrivial bounds for queue delay and jitter, for both bursty as well as continuous traffic streams. Furthermore, the DFQ discipline can combine a wide range of delay and jitter bounds while also managing the distribution of quality of service violations among the traffic streams when congestion occurs. Jitter control is performed at the network periphery and thus does not negatively influence multiplexing gain at intermediate nodes. This efficient strategy has major implications in terms of the preferred alternatives chosen by clients when implementing source clock recovery for voice. DFQ allows the entire range of implementation alternatives for voice over ATM to be appropriately serviced, such as ATM adaptation layer types 1 and 2 (AAL 1 / 2), adaptive playout, and immediate playout.

40|$|Abstract:- A very known {{method to}} {{transmit}} any signal by optical fiber is the IM-FM (Intensity Modulation-Frequency Modulation) subcarrier modulation. This {{is used in}} our work to transmit the electrical signal generated by wideband-low Mhz range ultrasonic transducers, which are used in NDT (Non Destructive Testing) systems. Usually, these systems are designed to control huge structures, so they take use of several receiving transducers, that are located far apart. Traditionally, transmission of such signals from the receiving transducer to the reception unit is performed using copper cables. For some applications (i. e. continuous monitoring of nuclear plants) metallic cables are not suitable because of their high sensitivity to electromagnetic perturbations. Moreover, the multiplexing is made electronically. When {{the distance between the}} transducers and the reception unit is high and/or electromagnetic noise is important, signal worsening appears. The proposed system implements the <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiplexing</b> of such signals using optical fiber. Optical fiber is made of dielectric materials (silica or plastic) so they are inherently passive to electromagnetic noise. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is utilized to adding channels in the system by means of fiber optic WDM couplers and different light sources. The wavelengths of the optical signals utilized are located far apart inside the optical spectrum in order to avoid serious crosstalk in transmission. The limits of the number of multiplexed channels depends on the selected optical fiber, light sources spectrum and the wavelength division multiplexers or couplers utilized...|$|E

30|$|Besides the {{widespread}} applications already demonstrated in long-distance optical <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> wavelength division <b>multiplex</b> (WDM) systems {{due to the}} superior features of the narrow emission spectrum and high thermal stability, the LC-DFB lasers have also demonstrated advantages for generating CW THz radiation. Compared with the traditional method to create THz radiation by using two independent diode lasers [24 – 26], LC-DFB lasers with simultaneous emission of two modes are very attractive for fabricating THz radiation sources due to the cost-effectiveness, compactness, high stability, and high spectral quality. In contrast to quantum well (QW) lasers, QD-based emitters are well suited for broadband tunable sources owing to two unique features of QD structures. Firstly, the nature of low density of states leads to the easy saturation of the GS levels, resulting in the further population of the excited states (ES). Secondly, the dot size variation can be utilized to extend the tuning range, {{due to the fact}} that the wide size distribution of the self-assembled QD ensemble leads to a wide spectrum of light emission governed by the quantum size effect.|$|R
