40|$|There are {{observational}} evidences for {{the existence}} of <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the solar corona. This inspires us to investigate the effect of a <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> on the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves in coronal loops. To this aim, we solve the incompressible linearized MHD equations in a magnetically twisted nonuniform coronal flux tube in the limit of long wavelengths. Our results show that a <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> can enhance or diminish the rate of phase-mixing of the Alfvén continuum modes and the decay rate of the global kink oscillation depending on the twist model and the sign of the longitudinal (k_z) and azimuthal (m) wavenumbers. Also our results confirm that {{in the presence of a}} <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> when the sign of one of the two wavenumbers m and k_z is changed, the symmetry with respect to the propagation direction is broken. Even a small amount of twist can have an important impact on the process of energy cascade to small scales. Comment: 25 pages, 22 figure...|$|E

We use a {{luminous}} fast magnetic rotator model {{to analyze the}} influence of a magnetic field on the linear waves induced in the wind of a massive star by the radiative instability. We show that a <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> can drive a strong wind with a wind efficiency (˙Mv∞) /(L/c) > 1 even without multiple scattering. The radiation amplified waves in the wind are modified by the <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> so that they can enhance the wind and lead to overestimates for ˙M and v∞. Finally we argue that the spin down time might be consistent with the lifetime derived from the mass loss rate within the uncertainties regarding the stellar structure.

40|$|We have {{performed}} the first fully three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulation for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes {{with a free}} falling corona and thin accretion disk. The initial simulation results with a Schwarzschild metric show that a jet is created {{as in the previous}} axisymmetric simulations with mirror symmetry at the equator. However, the time to form the jet is slightly longer than in the 2 -D axisymmetric simulation. We expect that the dynamics of jet formation are modified due to the additional freedom in the azimuth dimension without axisymmetry with respect to the Z axis and reflection symmetry respect to the equatorial plane. The jet which is initially formed due to the <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> and shocks becomes a wind at the later time. The wind flows out with a much wider angle than the initial jet. The <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> at the earlier time were untwisted and less pinched. The accretion disk became thicker than the initial condition.

Second, flare initiation occurs close to chirality inversion lines (which separate regions with twist of opposite handedness).

If the absorption rate calculated in this paper is used in conjunction with the observed wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient, it is found that the sunspot flux tube must have significant twist in the subsurface layers.

Next, the parameter domain investigated by Lou is substantially enlarged to higher m-values, larger sunspots, and sunspot models with a <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> A parametric study reveals that {{the efficiency of the}} absorption mechanism depends significantly on both the equilibrium model and the characteristics of the p-modes.

40|$|Context. The {{context of}} this paper is buoyant {{toroidal}} magnetic flux ropes, which is a part of flux tube dynamo theory and the framework of solar-like magnetic activity. Aims. The aim is to investigate how twisted magnetic flux ropes interact with a simple magnetized stellar model envelope—a magnetic “convection zone”—especially to examine how the <b>twisted</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> component of a flux rope interacts with a poloidal magnetic field in the convection zone. Methods. Both the flux ropes and the atmosphere are modelled as idealized 2. 5 -dimensional concepts using high resolution numerical magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Results. It is illustrated that twisted toroidal magnetic flux ropes can interact with a poloidal magnetic field in the atmosphere to cause a change in both the buoyant rise dynamics and the flux rope’s geometrical shape.
