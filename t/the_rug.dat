5|$|The {{meanings}} {{expressed in}} kilims derive {{both from the}} individual motifs used, and by their pattern and arrangement in <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> as a whole. A few symbols are widespread across Anatolia {{as well as other}} regions including Persia and the Caucasus; others are confined to Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
25|$|The current Rocky Mountains {{were raised}} in the Laramide orogeny from between 80 and 55 Ma. For the Canadian Rockies, the {{mountain}} building is analogous to a rug being pushed on a hardwood floor: <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> bunches up and forms wrinkles (mountains). In Canada, the terranes and subduction are the foot pushing <b>the</b> <b>rug,</b> the ancestral rocks are <b>the</b> <b>rug,</b> and the Canadian Shield {{in the middle of}} the continent is the hardwood floor.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} tools {{may be used to}} shear the wool depending on how <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> is trimmed as the weaving progresses or when <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> is complete. Often in Chinese rugs the yarn is trimmed after completion and the trimming is slanted where the color changes, giving an embossed three-dimensional effect.|$|E
25|$|To begin {{making a}} rug, one needs a {{foundation}} consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which {{run through the}} length of <b>the</b> <b>rug.</b> Similar threads which pass under and over the warps {{from one side to}} the other are called wefts. The warps on either side of <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> is completed, {{the warp}} ends form the fringes {{that may be}} weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in other ways.|$|E

25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to <b>the</b> <b>rug,</b> but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> is {{arranged}} and organized in typical ways, which {{in all their}} variety are nevertheless recognizable as Persian: One single, basic design may cover the entire field ("all-over design"). When {{the end of the}} field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of <b>the</b> <b>rug.</b> This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is prohibited even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the Quran by Uthman Ibn Affan in 651 AD/19 AH and the Umayyad Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reforms, Islamic art has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Persian rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments, often in form of elaborate spirals and tendrils in a manner called infinite repeat.|$|E

25|$|The {{author of}} The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album is Matt Groening, {{the creator of}} the {{animated}} series The Simpsons on which the book is based. It was released by Harper Paperbacks on November 20, 1991. The book's cover, which features the character Bart Simpson lying naked on his stomach on a bearskin rug, is a reference to a 1972 centerfold of Cosmopolitan in which American actor Burt Reynolds posed naked in a similar way. Newer printings feature Homer naked on <b>the</b> <b>rug.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For me {{this is not something}} that can be swept under <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E
25|$|The Tabriz loom, {{named after}} the city of Tabriz, is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are {{continuous}} and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when {{a portion of the}} carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled {{around the back of the}} loom. This process continues until <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.|$|E

25|$|Another carpet showing two medallions {{with two}} birds besides a tree {{was found in}} the Swedish church of Marby in Jämtland province. <b>The</b> <b>rug</b> was {{radiocarbon}} dated to 1300–1420. More fragments of this type were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. The Marby rug is divided into two rectangles, each containing an octagon with a tree and a pair of birds. The tree is mirrored along the horizontal middle axis of the octagon in a way which suggests its image is reflected in water.|$|E
25|$|King's addictions {{to alcohol}} and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he {{acknowledged}} in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo. Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> {{in front of him}} evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.|$|E
