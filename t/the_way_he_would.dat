5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go down the other side.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Another Rainbow {{took up the}} {{daunting}} task of collecting the entire Disney comic book oeuvre of Barks—over 500 stories in all—in the ten-set, thirty-volume Carl Barks Library. These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks´ pages in pristine black and white line art, {{as close as possible to}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> originally drawn them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, and more than a few surprises. This monumental project was finally completed in mid-1990.|$|E

Philip and Eliot then wake up; Philip seems keen on flatmate Jerene's {{research}} on lost languages. There is then an account of Jerene's childhood up to her coming out to her parents and being spurned by them. Philip and Eliot then talk about their experiences with men. Philip goes on to remember <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> masturbate a lot and how he tried to ask girls out - and they refused. Finally, he recalls going to a gay pornographic cinema when he was seventeen.|$|E

500|$|George Formby (born James Lawler Booth; 4 October 1875– 8 February 1921) was an English comedian {{and singer}} in musical theatre, {{known as one}} of the {{greatest}} music hall performers of the early 20th century. His comedy played upon Lancashire stereotypes, and he was popular around Britain. His nickname, [...] "The Wigan Nightingale", was coined because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> use his bronchial cough as a comedic device in his act.|$|E
500|$|Building on {{the success}} of their singles in the United States, and riding {{on the back of the}} British Invasion, Them {{undertook}} a two-month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. The Doors were the supporting act on the last week, and Morrison's influence on the Doors singer, Jim Morrison, was noted by John Densmore in his book Riders On The Storm. Brian Hinton relates how [...] "Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks." [...] On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on [...] "Gloria".|$|E
500|$|The film {{centers on}} the {{relationship}} between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of [...] "opening up", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and [...] "perfect trust". Hunnam commented that the film is [...] "a love story without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself". Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically [...] "become one", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. Del Toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> a sex scene.|$|E

60|$|Now, not {{far from}} where he lived, and beside the river, stood a willow-tree, and thither the lucky beggar took his purse of money and stuffed it into a knot-hole of a {{withered}} branch, then went his way, certain that nobody would think of looking for money in such a hiding-place. Then {{all the rest of the}} day he sat thinking and thinking of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> spend what had been given him, and what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do to get the most good out of it. At last came evening, and his brother, who had been begging in another part of the town, came home again.|$|R
500|$|As a young man, {{despite his}} dance talent, Sims {{aspired to be}} not a {{professional}} dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E

2500|$|Cosier played club cricket for Northcote {{where his}} captain was Bill Lawry. He made his {{first-class}} debut aged 18 for Victoria {{during the summer}} of 1971-72, opening with Lawry. Early sports writers sometimes compared him to Lawry. Cosier was a different style of batsman but later said [...] "Bill's influence on me was in the way he could fight out of a situation. He was incredible <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> bat with pain and with everything running against him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yorke told The Guardian that Michael Stipe of R.E.M. is his {{favourite}} lyricist, saying [...] "I loved <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take {{an emotion}} {{and then take}} a step back from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful." [...] The chorus lyric of [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] from Kid A was inspired by Stipe, who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: [...] "I'm not here, this isn't happening." [...] Yorke credited Neil Young as another major lyrical influence.|$|E
2500|$|Feeney {{attended}} Portland High School, Portland, Maine, {{where he}} was a successful fullback and defensive tackle. He earned the nickname [...] "Bull" [...] because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lower his helmet and charge the line. A Portland pub is named Bull Feeney's in his honor. He later moved to California and in 1914 began working in film production as well as acting for his older brother Francis, adopting [...] "Jack Ford" [...] as a professional name. In addition to credited roles, he appeared uncredited as a Klansman in D. W. Griffith's 1915 The Birth of a Nation, as the man who lifts up one side of his hood so he can see clearly.|$|E

2500|$|With {{production}} by Wilson, the Beach Boys covered Bacharach's [...] "My Little Red Book" [...] and [...] "Walk On By" [...] in 1967 and 1968 but left the recordings unreleased. Wilson {{has said that}} Bacharach was a direct influence on his [...] "She Knows Me Too Well", [...] "Let's Go Away for Awhile", and [...] "Love and Mercy". Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's [...] "Guess I'm Dumb", [...] "Let Him Run Wild, and [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". Discussing [...] "Let's Go Away", Wilson said: [...] "there {{were a lot of}} chord changes similar to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> put something together. And I think that his music had such a profound thing on my head; he got me going in a direction." [...] He mentions [...] "minor seventh chords" [...] as a specific point of influence.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, Batchelor {{resided in}} Grosse Pointe, Michigan. In his final months, Batchelor {{lived in a}} nursing home in Detroit. Sportswriter Joe Falls {{remained}} close to Batchelor in his later years. After Batchelor died, Falls described a visit to Batchelor at the nursing home:"Batch couldn't have weighed more than 60 pounds at the end, but his mind was nimble. He'd drift between fantasy and fact. ... But before you could feel pangs of sadness at his deterioration, he'd pull you close to the bed and whisper: 'I think it's great the Lions got Munson from the Rams. They couldn't win with Plum and Munson has the poise to be a good quarterback. Pour me a drink' Batch went out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have wanted, with his lifelong friend and companion, Jack Daniels, at his side. He couldn't eat at the end, and water repulsed him, so they let him sip his favorite liquid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ismail's father {{believed}} {{strongly in}} the benefits of education, unlike many Malays of the time, and ensured his children received the best education possible. Two of his sons became lawyers and another an economist. In 1939, the British General Adviser W.E. Pepys lamented that [...] "the only Johore Malay who has got a university degree is Encik(Mr.) Suleiman bin Abdul Rahman, the son of Dato Abdul Rahman, State Treasurer, Johore." [...] Ismail himself went on to obtain a degree at the King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore. In 1945, {{he became the first}} Malay to obtain a MBBS from University of Melbourne, Australia. Ismail's son later said that his education in Australia greatly impacted his worldview: [...] "He was on his own and a member of a minority there. He didn’t have other Malays to prop him up and he had a sense of loneliness. He felt that he was treated as an equal and that this was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> want to treat other people as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Petty's only {{statistical}} {{technique is}} the use of simple averages. He would not be a statistician by today's standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data. Because obtaining census data was difficult, if not impossible, especially for Ireland, he applied methods of estimation. The way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of London. He would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths. His method of using exports is by considering that a 30 percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by 30 – estimating that one out of thirty people die each year. To obtain the population of all of England he would multiply the population of London by 8. Such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and Petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the Crown. (Henry Spiegel) ...|$|E
