500|$|Test pilot Roland Beamont {{finally made}} the first flight from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, on 27 September 1964. Initial flight tests were all {{performed}} with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly controlledwith limits of [...] and [...] on the first (15-minute) flight. Shortly after takeoff on XR219's second flight, vibration from a fuel pump at the resonant frequency of the human eyeball caused the pilot <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> one engine to avoid momentary loss of vision.|$|E
5000|$|Ratio [...] is the {{quantity}} that determines the throttle {{setting of the}} engine.

50|$|The game's podracing {{utilizes}} the Kinect {{to simulate}} the dual throttle controls on podracers. Players extend arms fully to operate at full speed, and retract their arm <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> on one or both engines. Multiple courses are offered. Rancor Rampage, the games third mode, allows players to control one of multiple species of rancor which are let loose in various Star Wars locales. Arm movements synchronize between the player and their rancor, and players can execute special attacks in this destruction-based game mode.|$|E
50|$|Brown's B-17 {{began its}} 10-minute bomb run at 27300 ft with an outside air {{temperature}} of -60 C. Before the bomber released its bomb load, accurate flak shattered the Plexiglas nose, knocked out the number two engine and further damaged the number four engine, which was already in questionable condition and had <b>to</b> be <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> prevent overspeeding. The damage slowed the bomber and Brown was unable to remain with his formation and fell back as a straggler - a position from which he came under sustained enemy attacks.|$|R
5000|$|A related {{problem was}} that the aircraft's engines would have <b>to</b> be <b>throttled</b> down on landing approach. Since it could take as long as 20 seconds <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> them <b>back</b> up <b>to</b> full power, the big bomber could not easily do a [...] "touch and go" [...] {{momentary}} landing. A 16-foot [...] "approach chute" [...] (drogue parachute) provided aerodynamic drag so that the aircraft could be flown at approach speeds with the engines throttled at ready-to-spool-up medium power. On the ground, the pilots used the 32-foot [...] "brake chute". The brake chute could be deployed to stop the aircraft from [...] "porpoising", or bouncing, after a hard landing on the front nose gear. Training typically included an hour of dragging this chute around the landing pattern for multiple practice landings.|$|R
50|$|Anzio used a {{hydraulic}} catapult to launch planes, and these imposed {{a much higher}} G-force than the steam ones that later replaced them. When launching, Sharer had to brace {{his head against the}} headrest, but more importantly, he had to put his right elbow {{against the back of the}} arm rest. Since this hand held the throttle, if it wasn't braced this way, the cat launch would force his hand <b>to</b> move the <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> idle. The plane would end up stalling and likely be run over by the carrier after falling into the drink after launch.|$|R
50|$|Slower {{traffic in}} his lane forces Delaney to brake, {{allowing}} Stahler to overtake on the left. Delaney drafts the German, then both move alongside Wilson. Rather {{than try to}} pass Stahler, then possibly Wilson, Delaney drops back and bumps Stahler, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> to avoid spinning out when the Ferrari goes partially off the pavement. Delaney then uses the guardrail to block the aggressive Stahler's last ditch effort to overhaul, ensuring a win for Porsche. The teammates cross the finish line 1-2.|$|E
50|$|Test pilot Roland Beamont {{finally made}} the first flight from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, on 27 September 1964. Initial flight tests were all {{performed}} with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly controlled - with limits of 250 kn and 10,000 ft on the first (15-minute) flight. Shortly after takeoff on XR219's second flight, vibration from a fuel pump at the resonant frequency of the human eyeball caused the pilot <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> one engine to avoid momentary loss of vision.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, {{piloting}} {{his second}} homebuilt, [...] "Chief Oshkosh", Wittman placed {{second in the}} Greve Trophy Race. Wittman flew [...] "Bonzo" [...] in the Thompson Trophy race, and he led for the first 18 laps of the 20 lap race, at an average speed of over 275 mph (442.57 km/h). Suddenly his engine began to run rough, and Wittman was forced <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> {{to remain in the}} race, finishing in 5th place. In 1938, he was awarded the Louis Blériot medal by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E
50|$|At {{about seven}} and a half minutes into ascent, the mass of the vehicle was low enough that the engines had <b>to</b> be <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> limit vehicle {{acceleration}} to 3 g (29.4 m/s² or 96.5 ft/s², equivalent to accelerating from zero to 105.9 km/h in a second). The Shuttle would maintain this acceleration for the next minute, and main engine cut-off (MECO) occurred at about eight and a half minutes after launch. The main engines were shut down before complete depletion of propellant, as running dry would have destroyed the engines. The oxygen supply was terminated before the hydrogen supply, as the SSMEs reacted unfavorably to other shutdown modes. (Liquid oxygen has a tendency to react violently, and supports combustion when it encounters hot engine metal.) A few seconds after MECO, the external tank was released by firing pyrotechnic fasteners.|$|R
25|$|On 25 February 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800 {{registered}} as TC-JGE carrying 128 passengers and {{a crew of}} 7, crashed during final approach to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands. It was determined that a faulty radar altimeter caused the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> the engines <b>back</b> <b>to</b> idle and that the crew subsequently failed to react properly which resulted in an unrecoverable stall and the subsequent crash. Of the 135 people on board, nine people, including the three pilots, were killed. Eighty-six more people were transported to local hospitals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs you {{probably}} know by now {{we are working on}} a report on GaN and related materials. Compiling the market forecast for this half-formed sector — it still can't be said to have formed an indusry as yet — has not been easy. It is troublesome enough sorting out the technology and which player is doing what - because it's cards against the chest time — but when you throw in licensing and patents it becomes almost impossible. I was already worried that the market might never take shape and I have so far not been disavowed of this. At this point in time there are signs {{that there might be a}} market — a big market — but other factors may conspire <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> it <b>back</b> so that it takes longer than everyone expects to fulfil its potential...|$|R
5000|$|In later years, McFarland {{commented on}} {{this time in}} the context of women forcing their way to greater opportunities. In particular, she recalled: [...] "I'll never forget being at a Capitol Hill staff meeting in the early 1980s, after being {{at the top of my}} class at Oxford University and {{teaching}} nuclear weapons at MIT. One of the male staff members who was several years my junior, not as well qualified and not as productive, felt entitled enough to ask me to get him coffee. Later, when I asked my boss about it, he suggested I might want <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> on working so hard, because it was making the men on the staff feel threatened." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} to high altitude launches {{is that it}} eliminates the need <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> the engine when the [...] "Max Q" [...] limit is attained. Rockets launched in thick atmosphere can go so fast that air resistance may cause structural damage. [...] Engines are throttled back when Max Q is reached, until the rocket is high enough that they can resume full power. The Atlas V 551 gives an example of this. It reaches its Max Q at 30,000 feet. Its engine is throttled back to 60% thrust for 30 seconds. [...] This reduced acceleration adds to the gravity drag the rocket must overcome. Additionally, space craft engines concerned with Max Q are more complex as they must be throttled during launch.|$|E
50|$|To {{avoid all}} of these problems, the Internet Protocol allows for routers to simply drop packets if the router or a network segment is too busy to deliver the data in a timely fashion, or if the IPv4 header {{checksum}} indicates the packet has been corrupted. Obviously this is not ideal for speedy and efficient transmission of data, and {{is not expected to}} happen in an uncongested network. Dropping of packets acts as an implicit signal that the network is congested, and may cause senders {{to reduce the amount of}} bandwidth consumed, or attempt to find another path. For example, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is designed so that excessive packet loss will cause the sender <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> and stop flooding the bottleneck point with data (using perceived packet loss as feedback to discover congestion).|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then <b>throttles</b> down <b>to</b> 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine <b>throttles</b> down <b>to</b> 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine <b>throttles</b> <b>back</b> up <b>to</b> 102% before <b>throttling</b> <b>back</b> down <b>to</b> 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} how to price a conspicuous product while maintaining liquidity during a recession which both reduces demand and freezes credit markets. Reducing price would help maintain cash flow, but low prices can erode brand image and, hence, long-term sales. The paper extends earlier work of the same authors by explicitly deriving a firm's optimal cash management behavior, taking into account that a too low cash level results in bankruptcy. There are different sets of initial conditions for which qualitatively different solution trajectories are optimal. We distinguish mild and severe recessions. With mild recessions bankruptcy can be avoided for sure when the brand image is large enough. In case the recession is of intermediate strength, it can be optimal <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> forward then <b>back</b> how aggressively one spends down cash reserves, with the associated state constraint alternately being non-binding, binding, non-binding, then binding in such a way that the firm ceases operation...|$|R
5000|$|Takeoff speeds were in {{the region}} of 219 mph, with the pilot needing to swiftly raise the landing gear to avoid {{exceeding}} the limit speed of 299 mph. Climb and cruise performance were outstanding; occasionally a [...] "slow" [...] light would illuminate on the instrument panel at around Mach 2 to indicate that the engine compressor was nearing its limiting temperature and the pilot needed <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back.</b> Returning to the circuit, the downwind leg could be flown at 242 mph with [...] "land" [...] flap selected, while long flat final approaches were typically flown at speeds around 207 mph depending on the weight of fuel remaining. High engine power had to be maintained on the final approach to ensure adequate airflow for the boundary layer control system; consequently pilots were warned not to cut the throttle until the aircraft was actually on the ground. A drag chute and effective brakes shortened the Starfighter's landing roll.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the area}} affected, about 200,000 people {{continued}} to have power - in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario; the easternmost corner of Ontario (centered on Cornwall); the Buffalo, NY area, excluding southern Erie county, along the shore of Lake Huron via a feeder line to Owen Sound from Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. Three of the four Bruce B units were able <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> their output without a complete shutdown, then reconnect to the grid within five hours; the portion of New York state including parts of Albany and north and west of Albany; a small pocket of mid-east Michigan; the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; and small pockets in New Jersey. The unaffected area was protected by transmission circuit devices at the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations in Niagara Falls, (coincidentally, {{the starting point of}} the Northeast blackout of 1965) at a switching station of the hydroelectric power station in Cornwall, as well as central New York state. Philadelphia and the surrounding mid-Atlantic areas were also completely unaffected because PJM disconnected them. The power plant in East China, Michigan remained online for about 36 hours, and residents were informed that the plant would have to shut down in order to facilitate the reboot of the whole system.|$|E
5000|$|Almost every pilot at Croft had {{converted}} on to Halifaxes under a Squadron Leader named Peter James, {{the man who}} {{was working}} overtime to get everyone fit for the raid. James was 6 feet 21/2 inches tall, with very long legs, and feet that splayed out. His dark hair, close-cropped at the temples, clung easily to his scalp, he had a frank open face and an engaging smile, {{and he was one of}} those fortunate men who could maintain the aura of seniority and command and at the same time pass as one of the boys.Conversion flying was hard work, involving continual circuits and landings, four hours at a time, with four different pilots taking their turn. Then when the morning session was over the aircraft were serviced and fuelled ready for night flying. This was how Peter James spent his operational rest. Few men were more relaxed and even-tempered, yet there came a time when he was biting his lip until it bled.At Croft, high on the Yorkshire moors, Bob Plutte, Paddy Todd's pilot, took off at exactly midnight. Twenty minutes earlier, the tall instructor Peter James had taken off in a Halifax of the conversion flight. It had been an uncomfortable experience. In the middle of his take-off run, when he was trundling along the runway at 90 miles an hour, the blackout curtain above him had started to flutter and the hatch over the cockpit had begun to lift. James shouted at his second pilot to grab it but it was too late. Before anyone could do anything the hatch had blown open and locked itself fully back in the up-right position. The draught, and the noise of the engines and airstream, was terrific. But for the moment James had to concentrate on somehow completing the take-off. He was committed to it and it was too late <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> now.Once airborne he urged the crew to try to close the hatch, but they couldn’t get up into the airstream to do it. They tried to lasso it, and the flight engineer got a rope round it, but it refused to budge. Eventually James decided to leave it; if they pulled at it any more it might snap at the hinges and blow back against the tail. That could do enough damage to end their ambitions of going to Cologne or anywhere else.To the surprise of his scratch crew, Peter James made no attempt to turn back. They were briefed to fly at 15,000 feet, and the cold was so intense when they climbed up through the icing that James had to hold the control column with his elbows, his hands were so numb. It was colder than it had been in the early Whitleys, when they had no heaters at all and hoar frost had formed inside the plane. But this was one party James didn’t intend to miss.In common with many other pilots in the last wave, he mistook the burning city 150 miles ahead for the rising moon and altered course accordingly, unable to believe it could be Cologne. And shortly afterwards he met further misfortune; the port outer header tank blew up and he had to feather the engine. He continued to steer for Cologne for a time, but the odds were now too much against him and he was reluctantly forced to turn back.|$|E

"He {{was just}} {{one step ahead of}} me in traffic,” Harvick {{explained}} after finishing runner-up for the 10th time this season. “I couldn't get my car to rotate across the center like I needed it to, and every time I tried to force it would snap the back out.

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: Chopra {{and colleagues}} (1) discuss {{a need to}} limit {{preoperative}} stress testing, preoperative coronary revascularization, and perioperative -blockade. They use the phrase “time <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back,</b> ” because {{a growing body of}} research—much of it published in the past decade—has shown that these interventions do not improve outcomes in most patients. The authors promote the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on perioperative cardiovascular care for noncardiac surgery as a cost-effective and evidence-based approach. What Chopra and colleagues do not mention is that several of them were authors of the 1996 and 2002 versions of the same ACC/ AHA guideline. Those versions promoted stress testing for large sub-groups of patients despite minimal evidence that stress testing, and the coronary revascularization it sometimes spawned, was beneficial. In other words, several authors of the current article were themselve...|$|E
30|$|When {{the data}} {{rate of the}} data traffic flows is adapted by the Shaper, its buffers will fill up and the source node should need <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back.</b> To this end, AQM [34] could be a {{solution}} by using RED [34] queues. When the queue's occupation has reached a certain threshold, it can start dropping some random packets. This way, the congestion control of the relevant source node will react and decrease its send rate. This will also decrease {{the rate at which}} the Shaper's buffers are filled up. Instead of dropping packets, they could also be marked using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), which would lead to the same data rate decrease but without overhead retransmission. AQM is a better solution than just waiting for buffer overflows ('tail drop') to happen, as the latter would lead to TCP synchronization among the different source nodes. All nodes would take measures for congestion and the network will become under-utilized firstly and flooded afterwards when all nodes are increasing their send rate once again.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} (VANET) {{are characterized}} by high velocities and relatively uniform mobility of vehicles. As a result, the dynamics of VANET are different from generic mobile ad hoc networks. The behavior of vehicles and their effect on the protocol performance has not been comprehensively investigated {{in the context of}} VANET. In this work, we analyze the performance of multi-hop TCP in a multi-lane highway environment where vehicles are configured as clients or routers trying to reach a fixed access point. In particular, we look at the effect of tuning transmission power in dense and sparse road scenarios on the TCP throughput and latency. To conduct our study, we have developed an integrated simulation tool that accurately models both the vehicular mobility and the networking protocol stack. Using our simulation tool we obtain detailed TCP statistics and correlate them with the location, velocity, and other properties of VANET nodes. We study scenarios with a single sender as well as multiple senders. In each case, results show that throughput significantly deteriorates as the number of hops from the sender to the access point increases. A higher number of hops results in higher losses due to interference and loss of connectivity, which causes TCP <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> the sending rate unnecessarily. I...|$|E
5000|$|Around 30 seconds into ascent, the SSMEs were <b>throttled</b> down—usually <b>to</b> 72%, {{though this}} varied—to reduce the maximum {{aerodynamic}} forces {{acting on the}} Shuttle at a point called Max Q.

40|$|Smart buildings, as a concept, is now {{becoming}} {{prominent in the}} vocabulary of Architects, Engineers, Construction contractors, Technology companies, Property developers and the Estate or facility management function within organizations. Public or private sector, smart building goals are now prevalent in corporate strategies whenever new build or retrofit / refurbishment is planned. But there seems no common consensus on what this really means. The 1990 's and 2000 's witnessed much hype around intelligent buildings concepts. However, in many instances the hype never produced tangible results. Now the scene has changed. Sustainability and carbon management is increasingly {{on the agenda of}} boardroom decision making and smart in smart buildings seems to have a purpose, almost as a mission statement. The lack of clear definitions on what encompasses a smart building and what is to be expected when utilising a smart building whether as a solitary or group experience is causing the supply side industry <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> the adoption rate. Value structures justifying adoption are not clear in this early adaptor stage. Thus costs associated with the realisation of a smart building are quite hard to justify. This is compounded by the rapid pace of technology advancement and the continual refresh of new products and solutions that purport to provide an improved functionality or better price to performance advantage. Thus strategies for smart building realisation need to be formalised into industry accepted frameworks which can be applied in many market sectors - or verticals, and which can be applied in the context of small, medium and large buildings or campus premises. This paper presents some thought leadership in this emerging area of expertise and provides concepts that may form the fundamentals for a future framework. The author provides a perspective as a professional in Consulting for the Engineering and Construction industry with regards to integrating ICT systems into the built environment. ICT infrastructure comprises much of the building blocks for smart building enablement alongside automation and controls, electronic security and facility management applications. Converged IP networks, integrated command and control rooms, utility smart metering and integrated BMS (iBMS) enables smart building functionalities to be implemented.
