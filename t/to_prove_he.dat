5|$|Constantine neither {{enjoyed his}} legal studies, nor found the work easy, but was {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> could succeed. His wife kept him motivated, restricted visitors to avoid distractions and {{forced him to}} study, making him continue when he was several times tempted to give up. The family moved to London in 1949; between 1950 and 1954, Constantine passed the required series of examinations, and in 1954 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple.|$|E
5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E

5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban took its toll on Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal, aiming <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> could perform without the use of drugs. Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal, covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E

5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ann fears {{she made}} out with {{someone at the}} party but cannot remember. She {{eventually}} learns she made out with Chris, who shows a romantic interest in her. Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to close his tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who makes fun of his efforts to pick up women. The two get along and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites her out for a beer. As they finally start to get along, Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E

25|$|In August 2009, Satele {{suffered}} a left shoulder injury {{while attempting to}} make a tackle during a team practice. The injury, a torn labrum, required surgery that prematurely ended his 2009 campaign. Satele submitted a medical exemption application to the NCAA in order to attempt a comeback with the Warriors in 2010 however, the application was denied as the NCAA determined that Satele {{did not have the}} proper documentation <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> redshirted the 2005 season due to injury. Following the ruling, Satele was made eligible to enter the NFL.|$|E

25|$|Two {{documentary}} {{films are}} known to have been made in north-eastern Portugal where present day descendants of marranos were interviewed about their lives. In 1974 for The Marranos of Portugal, the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) sent reporter Ron Ben-Yishai to carry out interviews with families about their religious practice. After being asked <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> knew Hebrew before they would talk, he found people still reluctant to talk openly but did eventually gain a remarkable insight into their version of Jewish customs, prayers and songs. The film was commended at the 1976 Jerusalem Jewish Film and TV Festival. Another documentary, The Last Marranos, was made by the New York Jewish Media Fund in 1997.|$|E

25|$|In October 2003, Muhammad went {{on trial}} {{for the murder of}} Dean Meyers at a Prince William County service station near the city of Manassas. The trial had been moved from Prince William County, to Virginia Beach, {{approximately}} 200 miles away. Muhammad was granted the right to represent himself in his defense, and dismissed his legal counsel, though he immediately switched back to having legal representation after his opening argument. He was charged with murder, terrorism, conspiracy and the illegal use of a firearm, and faced a possible death sentence. Prosecutors said the shootings were part of a plot to extort $10 million from local and state governments. The prosecution said that they would make the case for 16 shootings allegedly involving Muhammad. The terrorism charge against Muhammad required prosecutors <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> committed at least two shootings in a three-year period.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Watkins Glen, Ambrose started {{fifth and}} {{dominated}} {{part of the}} race but was passed in a three-wide move by Kyle Busch with 20 laps remaining. When the white flag was about to wave he saw that Busch was slipping in oil; in {{the entrance to the}} esses he and Brad Keselowski passed him; Ambrose then saw that Keselowski was slipping in oil too and he took the lead in the final turn, holding off Keselowski {{for the second time in}} a row and defending his win from the previous year. Ambrose was very emotional about his win due to his father seeing it on television in a hospital for an illness and due to his luck that day. The win moved Ambrose up one position in the standings from 18th to 17th. Ambrose still has promised the racing world for a future oval win since his #1 goal currently is <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> can win at places other than road courses.|$|E
25|$|Upon his return, Bagwell {{attempted}} {{to win the}} World Tag Team Title with Douglas once more, but was unsuccessful. Bagwell, now with Torrie Wilson by his side, wrestled Douglas at Bash at the Beach, but lost when Wilson distracted him and sided with Douglas. Bagwell then began a feud with Chris Kanyon, who began stalking him and harassing Bagwell's mother Judy as a psychological tactic. Bagwell eventually defeated Kanyon in a match where Judy was suspended from a forklift. He rescued his mother despite the surprise interference of actor David Arquette. In August 2000, David Flair's storyline girlfriend Miss Hancock mysteriously became pregnant. Flair quickly accused the womanizing Bagwell, {{which led to a}} First Blood match at Halloween Havoc, with Flair hoping to obtain a sample of Bagwell's blood <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> was the father of Hancock's child. Although Bagwell was victorious, Flair managed to get his blood sample when Bagwell's nemesis Lex Luger attacked him after the match. Bagwell was then revealed as not being the father, and the entire pregnancy was eventually found to have been a fabrication.|$|E

25|$|The British {{troops were}} horrified and enraged. Upon {{learning}} of the massacre, the infuriated British garrison engaged in a surge of violence against the local population of Cawnpore, including looting and burning of houses, with the justification {{that none of the}} local noncombatants had done anything to stop the massacre. Brigadier General Neill, who took the command at Cawnpore, immediately began a program of swift and vicious drumhead military justice (culminating in summary execution) for any sepoy rebel captured from the city who was unable <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> was not involved in the massacre. Rebels confessing to or believed {{to be involved in the}} massacre were forced to lick the floor of the Bibighar compound, after it had been wetted with water by low caste people, while being whipped. The sepoys were then religiously disgraced by being forced to eat (or force fed) beef (if Hindu) or pork (if Muslim). The Muslim sepoys were sewn into pig skins before being hanged, and low-caste Hindu street sweepers were employed to execute the high-caste Brahmin rebels to add additional religious disgrace to their punishment.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{informed}} Butler of his recall on January 8, 1865, {{and named}} Major General Edward O. C. Ord {{to replace him}} as commander of the Army of the James. Rather than report to Lowell, Butler went to Washington, where he used his considerable political connections to get a hearing before the Joint Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War in mid-January. At his hearing Butler focused his defense on his actions at Fort Fisher. He produced charts and duplicates of reports by subordinates <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>he</b> had been right to call off his attack of Fort Fisher, despite orders from General Grant to the contrary. Butler claimed the fort was impregnable. To his embarrassment, a follow-up expedition led by Major General Alfred H. Terry captured the fort on January 15, and news of this victory arrived during the committee hearing; Butler's military career was over. He was formally retained until November 1865 {{with the idea that}} he might act as military prosecutor of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.|$|E

She moves in with him while she is investigated. Nadia seduces and sleeps with a drunken Phil. He regrets it, denying it to Kathy so Grant threatens to kill her to make her leave but Phil later bribes her into agreeing to a divorce. Kathy agrees to marry Phil in 1994 despite {{discovering}} that he torched Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) car lot in an insurance scam, accidentally killing a homeless boy trapped inside. Intent on winning him back, Sharon kisses Phil but he ends things there. During Phil and Kathy's engagement party, Grant listens to a cassette of Sharon admitting to the affair and plays it at the party. Kathy is incensed, and Grant beats Phil so badly {{that he has to}} go to hospital, due to a blood clot in his brain. Phil undergoes surgery, which stirs remorse in Grant. He pressures Phil into blaming Sharon for their affair and Grant forces her to leave Walford. Phil and Grant make peace but things between them are not the same.|$|E
