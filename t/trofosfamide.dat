40|$|BACKGROUND: Low- to intermediate-grade {{chondrosarcoma}} {{is usually}} a slow-growing and highly chemotherapyresistant tumor type. CASE REPORT: The 76 -year-old female patient presented with low- to intermediate-grade chondrosarcoma of the distal phalanx of the right thumb in 1993 and was treated with an excision of the carpometacarpal joint. Approximately 10 years later, the patient presented with recurrent local disease at the trapezoid bone, which was resected. Eight months later she presented with local recurrence at the carpal joint and lung metastases. Subsequently she was treated chemotherapeutically with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin {{as part of a}} clinical trial. Due to tumor progression after 2 cycles, she was switched to oral <b>trofosfamide</b> (150 mg daily). A follow-up CT scan after 8 months demonstrated a partial remission that was confirmed by a second scan after 9 months of treatment. The treatment was well tolerated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Systemic therapy {{options for}} {{patients}} with advanced angiosarcomas are limited, and their prognosis is poor. The idea of angiostatic therapy following the paradigm of metronomic dosed chemotherapeutics combined with proapoptotic biomodulators had not been considered previously in these patients. Therefore, in a pilot study, the efficacy of metronomically scheduled, low-dose <b>trofosfamide</b> {{in combination with the}} peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, pioglitazone, and the selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, was evaluated in patients with advanced vascular malignancies. METHODS: Six patients with advanced and pretreated but progressive, malignant vascular tumors (5 angiosarcomas and 1 hemangioendothelioma) received a combination of pioglitazone (45 mg per day orally) plus rofecoxib (25 mg per day orally) and, after 14 days, <b>trofosfamide</b> (3 x 50 mg per day orally). The therapy was administered continuously until progression was observed. If necessary, doses were modified according to side effects. RESULTS: Two patients responded with complete remission of disease, one patient responded with partial remission, and three patients achieved stabilization of disease (no change). The median progression-free survival was 7. 7 months (range, 2 - 15 months). Side effects generally were mild (World Health Organization Grade 1 - 2). Hospitalization was not necessary.

40|$|In oncology, {{particularly}} in pediatric malignancies, high doses (5 - 10 g/m 2) of the oxazaphosphorine ifosfamide {{play an important}} role in the treatment of sarcomas.

However, several intrinsic limitations have been uncounted during the clinical use of these oxazaphosphorines, including substantial pharmacokinetic variability, resistance and severe host toxicity. To circumvent these problems, new oxazaphosphorines derivatives have been designed and evaluated with an attempt to improve the selectivity and response with reduced host toxicity. These include mafosfamide (NSC 345842), glufosfamide (D 19575, β-Dglucosylisophosphoramide mustard), S-(-) -bromofosfamide (CBM- 11), NSC 612567 (aldophosphamide perhydrothiazine) and NSC 613060 (aldophosphamide thiazolidine). Mafosfamide is an oxazaphosphorine analog that is a chemically stable 4 -thioethane sulfonic acid salt of 4 -hydroxy-CPA. Glufosfamide is IFO derivative in which the isophosphoramide mustard, the alkylating metabolite of IFO, is glycosidically linked to a β-D-glucose molecule.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between methods for determining ifosfamide (IF), 2 - (2 DCE) and 3 -dechloroethylifosfamide (3 DCE) using gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC-NPD) versus positive ion electron-impact ion-trap mass spectrometry (GC-MS'). Sample pretreatment involved liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate after adding <b>trofosfamide</b> as internal standard and alkalinization. The GC-NPD was linear, specific, and sensitive for all analytes {{in the range}} of 0. 0500 - 100 mu g/mL with lower limits of quantification (LLQ) of 0. 0500 mu g/mL using a 50 -mu L plasma sample.

The ranges of accuracy, within-day precision, and between-day precision for analysis of all compounds with GC-NPD did not exceed 93. 3 % to 105. 4 %, 8. 0 % and 9. 8 %, respectively. The ranges of accuracy, within-day plecision, and between-day precision for analysis of all compounds with GC-MS' did not exceed 86. 5 % to 99. 0 %, 9. 0 % and 12. 7 %, respectively. In conclusion, GC-NPD proved to be superior to GC-MS 2 in sensitivity, detection range, accuracy, and precisions. Therefore GC-NPD is the method of choice for fast un-derivatized determination of IF, 2 DCE, and 3 DCE in human plasma, and it can readily be used for clinical pharmacokinetic studies and routine monitoring of IF-treated patients in a hospital setting...|$|E

In the current study, the authors sought to test one such combined approach {{in the treatment of}} chemorefractory melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma. METHODS: A Phase II trial was initiated to analyze the activity of a continuously administered molecularly targeted treatment regimen (daily pioglitazone [45 mg administered orally] and rofecoxib [25 mg administered orally]) combined with sequentially added angiostatic chemotherapy for patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma (n = 19) or soft tissue sarcoma (n = 21). Angiostatic chemotherapy consisted of <b>trofosfamide</b> (50 mg) administered orally 3 times daily beginning on the 15 th day after the start of molecularly targeted therapy. RESULTS: Forty patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Major side effects (World Health Organization Grade 3 or 4) were not observed. Objective responses and disease stabilization lasting longer than 6 months were noted in 11 % and 11 %, respectively, of all patients with melanoma and in 19 % and 14 %, respectively, of all patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Complete remission was noted in one patient with melanoma and in three patients with sarcoma. Both normal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and CRP levels that decreased by > 30 % during the 14 -day biomodulator pretreatment period were found to be predictive of prolonged progression-free survival.

40|$|The oxazaphosphorines {{including}} cyclophosphamide (CPA), ifosfamide (IFO) and <b>trofosfamide</b> are {{one important}} group of alkylating agents. However, resistance {{is the major}} hindrance for success of oxazaphosphorine chemotherapy. The mechanism of resistance to oxazaphosphorines is not fully identified, but recently some novel insights into these aspects have been generated by using sensitive analytical techniques and powerful pharmacogenetic techniques. Potential mechanisms for oxazaphosphorine resistance include decreased activation by cytochrome P 450 s (e. g. CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 B 6), increased deactivation of the agents by deactivating enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), increased cellular thiol level, increased DNA repair capacity, and altered cellular apoptotic response to DNA repair, e. g. deficient apoptosis {{due to lack of}} cellular mechanisms to result in cell death following DNA damage. In addition, decreased cellular accumulation of cytotoxic species of oxazaphosphorines may also {{play a role in the}} resistance. This review highlights the pharmacology of oxazaphosphorine anticancer drugs and possible agents that reverse the resistance to these agents. Possible agents that can overcome oxazaphosphorine resistance include inducers of CYPs, modulators of GSTs and ALDHs, modulators of DNA repair process, antisense oligonucleotides against genes encoding various enzymes and signalling proteins, and novel gene delivery systems. Most of these agents have been investigated in preclinical studies and promising results have been observed. To date, several types of these agents are being evaluated in Phase III trials in cancer patients.

40|$|The {{rationale}} {{for the development of}} prodrugs relies upon delivery of higher concentrations of a drug to target cells compared to administration of the drug itself. In the last decades, numerous prodrugs that are enzymatically activated into anticancer agents have been developed. This review describes the most important enzymes involved in prodrug activation notably with respect to tissue distribution, up-regulation in tumor cells and turnover rates. The following endogenous enzymes are discussed: aldehyde oxidase, amino acid oxidase, cytochrome P 450 reductase, DT-diaphorase, cytochrome P 450, tyrosinase, thymidylate synthase, thymidine phosphorylase, glutathione S-transferase, deoxycytidine kinase, carboxylesterase, alkaline phosphatase, β-glucuronidase and cysteine conjugate β-lyase. In relation to each of these enzymes, several prodrugs are discussed regarding organ- or tumor-selective activation of clinically relevant prodrugs of 5 -fluorouracil, axazaphosphorines (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and <b>trofosfamide),</b> paclitaxel, etoposide, anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin), mercaptopurine, thioguanine, cisplatin, melphalan, and other important prodrugs such as menadione, mitomycin C, tirapazamine, 5 -(aziridin- 1 -yl) - 2, 4 -dinitrobenzamide, ganciclovir, irinotecan, dacarbazine, and amifostine. In addition to endogenous enzymes, a number of nonendogenous enzymes, used in antibody-, gene-, and virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapies, are described. It is concluded that the development of prodrugs has been relatively successful; however, all prodrugs lack a complete selectivity. Therefore, more work is needed to explore the differences between tumor and nontumor cells and to develop optimal substrates in terms of substrate affinity and enzyme turnover rates for prodrug-activating enzymes resulting in more rapid and selective cleavage of the prodrug inside the tumor cells...|$|E
40|$|Soft tissue sarcomas {{are rare}} tumors {{that account for}} app. 1 % of all adult malignancies. They {{represent}} {{a broad spectrum of}} subtypes which differ substantially in their biological behaviour and therapeutic options. Currently, the three most demanding questions are: 1. improvement of first-line chemotherapy for advanced soft tissue sarcomas 2. identification of treatment options for patients with relapsing soft tissue sarcomas after prior chemotherapy 3. identification of soft tissue sarcoma subtypes with specific treatment options Only few active drugs are available for the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcomas. Current strategies for improvement focus on the development of optimized combination protocols with anthracyclines and ifosfamide striving for maximum tolerable doses. This requires the use of hematopoietic growth factors. Based on own results and published data, further dose escalation in the setting of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support seemed an interesting approach. However, preliminary results did not support superior efficacy. Treatment options for patients failing standard first-line chemotherapy are highly limited with high-dose ifosfamide being one of the possibilities. DTIC and topotecan were shown to be inactive. An interesting treatment concept that has not been investigated before in adult soft tissue sarcomas is maintenance therapy. First positive results could be shown with <b>trofosfamide.</b> In view of the high number of histologic subtypes, the identification of distinctive features and resulting treatment options becomes increasingly important. Alveolar soft part sarcoma was shown to be refractory to standard chemotherapy and associated with a very high percentage of brain metastases. Gastrointestinal stroma tumors are characterized by a pathogenic mutation in the transmembranous receptor tyrosin kinase c-kit. The development of the first specific tyrosin kinase inhibitor imatinib lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of these rare tumors.

40|$|The oxazaphosphorines cyclophosphamide, {{ifosfamide}} and <b>trofosfamide</b> {{remain a}} clinically useful class of anticancer drugs with substantial antitumour activity against {{a variety of}} solid tumors and hematological malignancies. A major limitation to their use is tumour resistance, {{which is due to}} multiple mechanisms that include increased DNA repair, increased cellular thiol levels, glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, and altered cell-death response to DNA damage. These mechanisms have been recently re-examined with the aid of sensitive analytical techniques, high-throughput proteomic and genomic approaches, and powerful pharmacogenetic tools. Oxazaphosphorine resistance, together with dose-limiting toxicity (mainly neutropenia and neurotoxicity), significantly hinders chemotherapy in patients, and hence, there is compelling need to find ways to overcome it. Four major approaches are currently being explored in preclinical models, some also in patients: combination with agents that modulate cellular response and disposition of oxazaphosphorines; antisense oligonucleotides directed against specific target genes; introduction of an activating gene (CYP 3 A 4) into tumor tissue; and modification of dosing regimens. Of these approaches, antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy are perhaps more speculative, requiring detailed safety and efficacy studies in preclinical models and in patients. A fifth approach is the design of novel oxazaphosphorines that have favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and are less vulnerable to resistance. Oxazaphosphorines not requiring hepatic CYP-mediated activation (for example, NSC 613060 and mafosfamide) or having additional targets (for example, glufosfamide that also targets glucose transport) have been synthesized and are being evaluated for safety and efficacy. Characterization of the molecular targets associated with oxazaphosphorine resistance may lead to {{a deeper understanding of the}} factors critical to the optimal use of these agents in chemotherapy and may allow the development of strategies to overcome resistance. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The oxazaphosphorines {{including}} cyclophosphamide (CPA), ifosfamide (IFO), and <b>trofosfamide</b> {{represent an}} important group of therapeutic agents {{due to their}} substantial antitumor and immuno-modulating activity. CPA is widely used as an anticancer drug, an immunosuppressant, and for the mobilization of hematopoetic progenitor cells from the bone marrow into peripheral blood prior to bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia, leukemia, and other malignancies. New oxazaphosphorines derivatives have been developed {{in an attempt to}} improve selectivity and response with reduced toxicity. These derivatives include mafosfamide (NSC 345842), glufosfamide (D 19575, β-D-glucosylisophosphoramide mustard), NSC 612567 (aldophosphamide perhydrothiazine), and NSC 613060 (aldophosphamide thiazolidine). This review highlights the metabolism and transport of these oxazaphosphorines (mainly CPA and IFO, as these two oxazaphosphorine drugs are the most widely used alkylating agents) and the clinical implications. Both CPA and IFO are prodrugs that require activation by hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP) -catalyzed 4 -hydroxylation, yielding cytotoxic nitrogen mustards capable of reacting with DNA molecules to form crosslinks and lead to cell apoptosis and/or necrosis. Such prodrug activation can be enhanced within tumor cells by the CYP-based gene directed-enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) approach. However, those newly synthesized oxazaphosphorine derivatives such as glufosfamide, NSC 612567 and NSC 613060, do not need hepatic activation. They are activated through other enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic pathways. For example, both NSC 612567 and NSC 613060 can be activated by plain phosphodiesterase (PDEs) in plasma and other tissues or by the high-affinity nuclear 32 ̆ 7 - 52 ̆ 7 exonucleases associated with DNA polymerases, such as DNA polymerases and ε. The alternative CYP-catalyzed inactivation pathway by N-dechloroethylation generates the neurotoxic and nephrotoxic byproduct chloroacetaldehyde (CAA). Various aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of oxazaphosphorine metabolites. The metabolism of oxazaphosphorines is auto-inducible, with the activation of the orphan nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) being the major mechanism. Oxazaphosphorine metabolism is affected by a number of factors associated with the drugs (e. g., dosage, route of administration, chirality, and drug combination) and patients (e. g., age, gender, renal and hepatic function). Several drug transporters, such as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP 1, MRP 2, and MRP 4) are involved in the active uptake and efflux of parental oxazaphosphorines, their cytotoxic mustards and conjugates in hepatocytes and tumor cells. Oxazaphosphorine metabolism and transport {{have a major impact on}} pharmacokinetic variability, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship, toxicity, resistance, and drug interactions since the drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters involved are key determinants of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxazaphosphorines. A better understanding of the factors that affect the metabolism and transport of oxazaphosphorines is important for their optional use in cancer chemotherapy. <br /...|$|E
