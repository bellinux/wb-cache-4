[...] "We fully expect to be releasing a new Eminem album in 2013. He's {{been working on it}} for some time," [...] said Rosenberg. [...] "It's safe to say that it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> else lines up." [...] On March 22, 2013, during an interview with Power 106, Dr. Dre said that he was working with Eminem, and that Eminem was [...] "finishing up his project." ...|$|E

60|$|Some day, {{somebody}} will find and read what he writes. This will be terrible. I {{am suspicious of}} the servant, who is always peeping and peering, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I write. I must do something. Every servant I have had is curious about what I write.|$|E

60|$|The {{workshop}} {{was shut}} up, {{no one was}} about either there or at the house. He considered a moment whether <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was doing at Greenhow, or to go and tell his aunt how he had fared, and that he knew the captain must be at home by this time.|$|R
60|$|I heard {{something}} breathing, saw something crouched together close beside me. I held my breath, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it was. It {{began to move}} slowly, interminably. Then something soft and warm and moist passed across my hand. All my muscles contracted. I snatched my hand away. A cry of alarm began and was stifled in my throat. Then I just realised what had happened sufficiently to stay my fingers on the revolver.|$|E
60|$|On {{the narrow}} {{point of land}} {{commanding}} {{a view of the}} rivers stood a long, low structure enclosed by a stockade fence, on the four corners of which were little box-shaped houses that bulged out as if <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was going on beneath. The massive timbers used in the construction of this fort, the square, compact form, and the small, dark holes cut into the walls, gave the structure a threatening, impregnable aspect.|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} sat, with knitted brows, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it was. He had {{only had a}} glimpse of it, but he {{certainly}} had an {{idea that it was}} alive. A rat perhaps. He got off the bed again with an oath, and, taking the lamp in his hand, peered cautiously about the floor. Twice he walked round the room in this fashion. Then he stooped down, and, raising the dirty bed hangings, peered beneath.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh!' {{said the}} old man, bending over the body and looking round as he spoke into Barnaby's pale face, strangely lighted up by {{something}} that was NOT intellect. 'The robber made off that way, did he? Well, well, never mind that just now. Hold your torch this way--a little farther off--so. Now stand quiet, while I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> harm is done.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her father began dusting and {{arranging}} {{half a dozen}} paintings of various sizes, mounted on stretchers. None was finished; some were scarcely begun. Lory <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they represented. Perhaps she had inherited from her mother a bit of artistic instinct; if so, it was that which prompted her to shrug her small shoulders slightly and then turn away to the window.|$|R
5000|$|Mohammad Amir {{was born}} in 1992 in the remote village of Changa Bangial, Gujar Khan, Punjab. He was the second {{youngest}} of seven children.

6000|$|... "Yes, yes, that's what I mean. She's got it right," [...] he exclaimed, after Katharine had restated his case, {{and made}} it more precise. The debate was left almost solely to Katharine and Ralph. They looked into each other's eyes fixedly, like wrestlers <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{movement}} is coming next, and while Ralph spoke, Katharine bit her lower lip, and was always ready with her next point {{as soon as he}} had done. They were very well matched, and held the opposite views.|$|E

"They {{struck a}} bee-line {{for the club}} quarters, and on {{arriving}} there loitered around with never a thought that {{there were plenty of}} chores to be done at the farm, till I was tired of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was going on, so off I hopped, counting on paying Cheeko a visit to liven him up a bit.

6000|$|... 'In {{a moment}} we all seemed {{to feel as if}} {{something}} had happened, and I went through great agony of suspense <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> seemed just beyond my view. Soon, however, two or three men approached, and carried him past before my eyes, and again my anxiety was intense to discover if he were only very badly hurt or if life were really extinct. All this happened in a few moments, but long enough to have left me so agitated that I could not realise it had only been a vision in a glass ball.|$|E

60|$|If {{this talk}} were true, I, for one, should not greatly care to toil {{in the service}} of natural knowledge.

60|$|The {{man went}} back to the kitchen, and I walked slowly around the bear, looking at the chain and the post, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> sort of a collar was almost hidden under his shaggy hair. Apparently he seemed {{securely}} attached, and then--as he {{was at the end of}} his chain--I went up to him and gently patted one paw. He did not object to this, and turning his head he let his tongue loll out on the other side, fixing his little black eyes upon me with much earnestness. When the man came with the pan of scraps from the kitchen I took it from him and placed it on the ground in front of the bear. Instantly the animal dropped to his feet and began to eat with earnest rapidity.|$|E
6000|$|Secluding {{themselves}} in the garret, they devoted several play-hours to the manufacture of some mysterious machine, which took so much paste that Asia grumbled, and the little girls wondered mightily.

Wednesday afternoon was fine, and after a good deal of consultation about wind and weather, Nat and Tommy went off, bearing an immense flat parcel hidden under many newspapers. Nan nearly died with suppressed curiosity, Daisy nearly cried with vexation, and both quite trembled with interest when Demi marched into Mrs. Bhaer's room, hat in hand, and said, in the politest tone possible to a mortal boy of his years, ...|$|E

At last I got the chance--to get into that house. And you bet your life I took it! [Defiantly.] And I ain't sorry neither. [After a pause--with bitter hatred.] It was all men's fault--the whole business. It was men on the farm ordering and beating me--and giving me the wrong start.

60|$|Natural {{knowledge}} is, {{in their}} eyes, no real mother of mankind, bringing {{them up with}} kindness, and if need be, with sternness, {{in the way they}} should go, and instructing them in all things needful for their welfare; but a sort of fairy godmother, ready to furnish her pets with shoes of swiftness, swords of sharpness, and omnipotent Aladdin's lamps, so that they may have telegraphs to Saturn, and see {{the other side of the}} moon, and thank God they are better than their benighted ancestors. If this talk were true, I, for one, should not greatly care to toil in the service of natural knowledge.

6000|$|For an hour {{they were}} very good, then they grew tired of one room, and longed to get out. Never had the hall seemed so inviting; even the little bedroom {{acquired}} a sudden interest, and they would gladly have gone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed. The open windows drove them wild {{because they could not}} reach them; and the outer world seemed so beautiful, they wondered how they ever found the heart to say it was dull. Nan pined for a race round the lawn, and Rob remembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning, and wondered what poor Pollux would do. They watched the clock, and Nan did some nice calculations in minutes and seconds, while Rob learned to tell all the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them. It was maddening to smell the dinner, to know that there was to be succotash and huckleberry pudding, and to feel {{that they would not be}} on the spot to secure good helps of both. When Mary Ann began to set the table, they nearly cut themselves in two <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> meat there was to be; and Nan offered to help her make the beds, if she would only see that she had [...] "lots of sauce on her pudding." ...|$|E

6000|$|Eight or {{nine months}} after the {{distress}} of the torrents had departed from me, the roar and thunder of the streets of Paris brought it all back again. I moved to the sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace. About midnight the noises dulled away, and I was sinking to sleep, when I heard a new and curious sound; I listened: evidently some joyous lunatic was softly dancing a [...] "double shuffle" [...] in the room over my head. I {{had to wait for}} him to get through, of course. Five long, long minutes he smoothly shuffled away--a pause followed, then something fell with a thump on the floor. I said to myself [...] "There--he is pulling off his boots--thank heavens he is done." [...] Another slight pause--he went to shuffling again! I said to myself, [...] "Is he <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> he can do with only one boot on?" [...] Presently came another pause and another thump on the floor. I said [...] "Good, he has pulled off his other boot--NOW he is done." [...] But he wasn't. The next moment he was shuffling again. I said, [...] "Confound him, he is at it in his slippers!" [...] After a little came that same old pause, and right after it that thump on the floor once more. I said, [...] "Hang him, he had on TWO pair of boots!" [...] For an hour that magician went on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as many as twenty-five pair, and I was hovering on the verge of lunacy. I got my gun and stole up there. The fellow {{was in the midst of}} an acre of sprawling boots, and he had a boot in his hand, shuffling it--no, I mean POLISHING it. The mystery was explained. He hadn't been dancing. He was the [...] "Boots" [...] of the hotel, and was attending to business.|$|E
