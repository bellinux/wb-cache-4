5|$|Cards' player-manager Rogers Hornsby chose Alexander {{to start}} Game6, and used him in relief to close out Game7. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won {{the final two}} games of the series, {{and with it the}} world championship. In Game7, the Yankees, {{trailing}} 3–2 {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning and down to their last out, Ruth walked, bringing up Bob Meusel. Ruth, successful in half of his stolen base attempts in his career, took off for second base on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch.</b> Meusel swung and missed, and catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to second baseman Hornsby who tagged Ruth out, ending Game 7 and thereby crowning his Cardinals World Series champions for the first time. The 1926 World Series is the only Series to date which ended with a baserunner being caught stealing.|$|E

5|$|Obama is a {{supporter}} of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.|$|E
5|$|The Boston Americans {{played the}} Pittsburgh Pirates {{in the first}} modern World Series in 1903. Young, who started Game One against the visiting Pirates, thus threw <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> in modern World Series history.

Young finished the series with a 21 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three games.|$|E

Homer quickly joins in with the fans to support the Isotopes, who end up winning the pennant. To celebrate, Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Barney go on a drunken binge and accidentally vandalize Springfield Elementary School.|$|E

5|$|The Sounds' home opener, {{scheduled}} for April 25, was rained out and pushed back to April 26. After playing their first ten games away from home, and with tractors and grading machines still preparing {{the field on}} game day, the Sounds played their first home game at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 26, 1978. The 12–4victory against the Savannah Braves was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 8,156 spectators. Southern League president Billy Hitchcock was on hand to witness the event, and Conway Twitty threw out <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{rebuilding}} of the venue took place {{ahead of the}} 1962 season, when the wooden stands were torn and replaced with concrete stands on both long sides. On the south side, a wave-shaped roof was built; originally designed to be self-supporting, the contractor, Reinertsen, did not trust their own calculations and made a last-minute decision to install support columns. The new stands were taken into use on 3 May 1962. Floodlighting was installed in 1968 to allow UEFA club tournament matches {{to be held at}} the venue. An all-weather running track was subsequently also laid. On 1 December 1988, Lerkendal Station opened, allowing train passengers a short walk to the stadium. In 1994, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> with Desso GrassMaster was laid.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine. Ellis admired Pete Rose and was concerned about how he would respond, but Ellis {{decided to do it}} regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of the}} first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E

5|$|In June 2001, Ripken {{announced}} he would retire {{at the end of}} the season. He was voted the starting third baseman in the All-Star Game at Seattle's Safeco Field on July 10, 2001. In a tribute to Ripken's achievements and stature in the game, shortstop Alex Rodriguez (unknowingly foreshadowing his own future) insisted on exchanging positions with third baseman Ripken for the first inning, so that Ripken could play shortstop as he had for most of his career. That move allowed Ripken to claim the record of most MLB All-Star Game appearances at shortstop. In the third inning, Ripken made his first plate appearance and was greeted with a standing ovation. Ripken then homered off <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> from Chan Ho Park. Ripken ended up with All-Star MVP honors, becoming one of four players in MLB history with multiple All Star Game MVP Awards (1991 and 2001) and the only player to be named All-Star Game MVP in two different decades.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, {{and they wanted to}} get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights. Wiggins was hit with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E
5|$|Pollet {{started the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three Brooklyn hitters. Eddie Stanky grounded out, Cookie Lavagetto flied out to center field, and Joe Medwick grounded out to end the inning. Branca took the mound {{in the bottom of}} the first, striking out Red Schoendienst and allowing a single to Terry Moore. After National League MVP Musial struck out, Enos Slaughter singled and Whitey Kurowski walked to load the bases. Joe Garagiola, Sr. brought in a run before being tagged out to end the inning with the score 1–0. In the second inning, Carl Furillo reached base on an error by Pollet. Pee Wee Reese singled, but Furillo was out at second. Another groundout brought the Cardinals back up, and the Dodgers got all three batters quickly out to end the inning. In the top of the third, Howie Schultz hit a home run on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> he saw, tying the score at 1–1. After three more outs, St. Louis came back up to bat. Moore flied out, then Musial walked, and Slaughter singled. Musial scored on Kurowski's hit while Slaughter was called out, and after two more singles, the latter bringing in Kurowski, Branca was taken out of the game.|$|E

5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pitch</b> {{thrown by}} Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, {{the first in}} a World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy {{recorded}} the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead {{in the top of the}} sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with a sacrifice fly. Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and throw out to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with a sacrifice fly, and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets 2 outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, to tie a World Series game on a home run in the ninth inning.|$|E
