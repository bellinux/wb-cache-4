Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E

The authors have measured noise and seismic phase amplitudes of over 250 earthquakes and 18 underground nuclear explosions recorded at the broadband, digital station WMQ in western China and over 100 earthquakes and 5 nuclear explosions at station AAK in Kyrgyzstan. The explosions are from the Kazakh Test Site (KTS) and Lop Nor, China. The earthquakes are mostly from northwest China. They have also evaluated a single suspected chemical explosion. Event magnitudes (m{sub b}) range between 2. 5 and 6. 5 and maximum event-station distance is about 1, 700 km. Using these measurements the authors formed phase, spectral, cross-spectral, short-period/long-period, and long-period ratios to test many possible event discriminants.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{a lot of}} {{work was}} done that has {{revealed}} some very interesting properties of neutron stars. One can relate the first few multipole moments of a neutron star, or quantities that can be derived from them, with relations that are independent of the equation of state (EoS). This is a very significant result that has great implications for the description of neutron stars and in particular for the description of the spacetime around them. Additionally, it was recently shown that there is a four parameter analytic spacetime, known as the two-soliton spacetime, which can accurately capture the properties of the geometry around neutron stars. This allows for the possibility of describing in a unified formalism the astrophysically relevant properties of the spacetime around a neutron star independently of the particulars of the EoS for the matter of the star. More precisely, the description of these astrophysical properties is done using an EoS omniscient spacetime that can describe the exterior of any neutron star. In the present work we investigate properties such as the location of the innermost stable circular orbit $R_{ISCO}$ (or the surface of the star when the latter overcomes the former), the various frequencies of perturbed circular equatorial geodesics, the efficiency of an accretion disc, its temperature distribution, and other properties associated with the emitted radiation from the disc, in a way that holds for all possible choices of a realistic EoS for the neutron star.
