5|$|Despite {{the attack}} on his family, Captain Pipe {{said that he would}} not seek vengeance. Instead, in September 1778, {{he was one of the}} signers of the Treaty of Fort Pitt between the Delawares and the United States. Americans hoped this {{agreement}} with the Delawares would enable American soldiers to pass through Delaware territory and attack Detroit, but the alliance deteriorated after the death of White Eyes, the Delaware chief who had negotiated the treaty. Eventually, Captain Pipe turned against <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> moved his followers west to the Sandusky River, where he received support from the British in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the high ground behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island. The American second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a surprise to <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
50|$|Mechanically, the European Civic {{differs from}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> JDM {{variants}} {{in that it}} uses a simpler torsion beam suspension system for the rear wheels compared to the double-wishbone system in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> JDM versions. <b>The</b> more compact suspension of the European Civic allows it to keep its large interior space, while reducing its length compared to its predecessor. Engines include a 1.4-litre i-DSI,1.4-litre i-vtec, the 1.8-litre i-VTEC(R18A2) shared with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> JDM models (although <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> JDM cars have this engine available as R18A1), and a 2.2-litre i-CTDi N22A2 turbodiesel. A 6-speed manual transmission is available across the range. An automated manual transmission, known as i-SHIFT is available for models with 1.4- and 1.8-litre petrol engines. A 2.0-litre i-VTEC (K20Z4) petrol Type-R high-performance version is also available.|$|R

Ismay was also appointed to the committee which wrote the formal report of the conference. After the conference, Ismay visited the American headquarters in Algiers to meet with Eisenhower, and helped resolve some differences of opinion between Eisenhower and his British colleagues.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted Minh's MRC in a bloodless pre-dawn coup; {{although}} Khánh {{accused the}} junta of intending {{to make a}} deal with the communists and claimed to have proof, he was actually motivated by personal ambition. After Khánh was deposed a year later, he admitted that the allegations against Minh's group were false. In later years, Khánh, Thơ and Minh's generals all agreed that the coup was strongly encouraged by <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> could not have occurred without their backing.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2006, Monsoor's platoon engaged four {{insurgents in}} a firefight, killing one and {{injuring}} another.

Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off the streets, and a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people to fight against <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> the Iraqi soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E

5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|This {{battle was}} the final major Japanese {{offensive}} in the Solomon Islands campaign. Following the engagement the Japanese force withdrew from the Empress Augusta Bay area, and only limited fighting took place until late 1944 when Australian troops took over from <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> {{began a series of}} advances across the island which continued {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of Old Baldy heavy {{fighting}} took place around Pork Chop Hill, which was later made famous by the movie Pork Chop Hill starring actor Gregory Peck.

Due to his efforts and the successful withdrawal of troops, he was awarded a second Silver Star for gallantry.

5|$|Upon the {{beginning}} of the American Revolutionary War, Spanish governor, Bernardo de Galvez, in New Orleans assisted the American rebels with weapons, food, blankets, tents and ammunition. The Spanish lieutenant governors at St. Louis also aided the colonials, particularly the forces of George Rogers Clark during the Illinois campaign. After the official entry of Spain into the American Revolutionary War in June 1779 on the side of <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> the French, the British began preparing an invasion to attack St. Louis and other Mississippi outposts. However, St. Louis was warned of the plans, and residents began to fortify the town.|$|E
5|$|Washington and Rochambeau {{discussed}} {{where to}} launch a joint attack. Washington believed an attack on New York was the best option, since <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1. Rochambeau disagreed, arguing the fleet in the West Indies under Admiral de Grasse was going to sail to the American coast, where easier options than attacking New York could be attempted.|$|E
5|$|After initial preparations, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> French {{built their}} first {{parallel}} {{and began the}} bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.|$|E

5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas {{of discipline and}} tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they were}} accustomed. This resulted in friction between <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Groves and Furman, the Alsos Mission was created on 4 April 1944 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to conduct {{intelligence}} in the field relating to the German nuclear energy project. The more experienced British considered creating a rival mission, but in the end {{agreed to participate in the}} Alsos Mission as a junior partner. In June 1945, Welsh reported that the German nuclear physicists captured by the Alsos Mission were in danger of being executed by <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> Jones arranged for them to be moved to Farm Hall, a country house in Huntingdonshire used for training by MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The house was bugged, and the conversations of the scientists were recorded.|$|E
5|$|By early July the Chinese {{launched}} a major offensive in the ROK II Corps and US X Corps sectors. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> South Koreans subsequently {{responded with a}} series of counter-attacks to regain the ground lost, yet these met with only limited success. On 6 July the Chinese attacked elements of the US 7th Division on Porkchop Hill on the US I Corps right flank, and succeeded in gaining the crest. The Americans were reinforced and counter-attacked over the following days, although again without success. Following another Chinese assault on 9 July the Americans again counter-attacked, yet neither side gained a clear advantage. The following day the Chinese {{launched a}} series of company and battalion-sized assaults, but were repulsed. Yet, with the Americans unprepared to accept further casualties for limited tactical gain, they evacuated Porkchop Hill on 11 July.|$|E
