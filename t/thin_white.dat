5|$|In {{addition}} to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former Japan Post flag consisted of the Hinomaru with a red horizontal bar placed {{in the center of}} the flag. There was also a <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> ring around the red sun. It was later replaced by a flag that consisted of the 〒 postal mark in red on a white background.|$|E
5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruit body by a funiculus, a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In some species the peridioles may be covered by a tunica, a <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> membrane (particularly evident in C.striatus and C.crassimurus).|$|E
5|$|Station to Station is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976. Commonly {{regarded as one}} of his most significant works, Station to Station was the vehicle for his performance persona, the <b>Thin</b> <b>White</b> Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.|$|E

50|$|Hypselodoris flavomarginata has a pink {{body and}} a wide light-yellow mantle edge. A <b>thinner</b> <b>white</b> line {{separates}} the yellow mantle from the pink body and dorsum. The gills and rhinophores are white and dark-pink.|$|R
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), {{and a black}} band on the upper back. The wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|It {{was on the}} set of {{his first}} major film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called The Return of the <b>Thin</b> <b>White</b> Duke. He was also {{composing}} music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.) Director Nicolas Roeg warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E

25|$|The {{root system}} of Pinguicula species is {{relatively}} undeveloped. The <b>thin,</b> <b>white</b> roots serve mainly as an anchor {{for the plant}} and to absorb moisture (nutrients are absorbed through carnivory). In temperate species these roots wither (except in P. alpina) when the hibernaculum is formed. In the few epiphytic species (such as P. lignicola), the roots form anchoring suction cups.|$|E
25|$|At 20:05 local time, a <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> {{plume of}} smoke seemed {{for a moment}} to {{indicate}} the election was over, and the 40,000 people who had spent the afternoon watching the ceremonies on large screens in St. Peter's Square broke into applause and song. But the smoke quickly grew stronger and clearly dark. The crowd quieted and cleared in a matter of minutes.|$|E
25|$|Utzon himself {{designed}} the altar wall {{which consists of}} an airy triangular grid of <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> tiles, known as Flensborg bricks, while the church's colourful textiles, carpeting and ceramic decorations were designed by his daughter, Lin Utzon. The organ, also designed by Jørn Utzon, was constructed in 1979 by Poul-Gerhard Andersen, with woodwork by Kurt Kærsgaard. The light pine pews {{as well as the}} church's concert piano, built by Steingraeber & Söhne in Bayreuth, were also designed by Utzon.|$|E

50|$|Their main {{distinguishing}} {{factors are}} their stripes and their tails; G. f. fasciata has a fuller, reddish-brown tail and 8-10 stripes, while G. f. striata has a <b>thinner,</b> <b>white</b> tail and 5 stripes. They are all forest-dweller {{on the eastern}} side of the island, and their primary prey is small rodents. This species is most active in the evening and at night.|$|R
25|$|A <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> stripe, or fimbriation, {{separates}} {{the red cross}} from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's rule of tincture where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. argent or silver). The blazon for the old union flag, to {{be compared with the}} current flag, is azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.|$|E
25|$|The {{two primary}} {{features}} {{used to identify}} this bird {{in the field are}} its long wings and its white rump. The white patch on the rump can be seen while the bird is in flight. Its long wings extend beyond the tail by about a quarter inch. Baird's sandpiper also shows this trait but can be distinguished by the lack of a white rump. There is also a <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> stripe on the wing and a row of marks on the flanks below the wings.|$|E
25|$|The raw {{material}} used for {{these kinds of}} soap is olive oil. The Tripoli soap is also composed of: honey, essential oils, and natural aromatic {{raw material}}s like flowers, petals, and herbs. The soaps are dried in the sun, in a dry atmosphere, allowing the evaporation of the water that served to mix the different ingredients. The drying operation lasts for almost three months. As the water evaporates, a <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> layer appears on the soap surface, from the soda that comes from the sea salts. The craftsman brushes the soap very carefully with his hand until the powder trace is entirely eliminated.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, a new {{aircraft}} livery featuring {{a dark blue}} upper half and tail, with a light grey lower half separated by a <b>thin,</b> <b>white</b> stripe, was introduced. At this time, BMA was branded simply British Midland, and a new logo featuring a stylised red BM crowned with a white diamond shape appeared on aircraft tailfins. This livery subsequently featured a darker blue upper half and tail, with a deep grey lower half separated by two thin stripes, very dark blue {{at the top and}} red at the bottom. However, the logo on the aircraft's fins remained unchanged.|$|E
25|$|Numerous bands {{have found}} their names in Burroughs's work. The most widely known of these is Steely Dan, a group named after a dildo in Naked Lunch. Also from Naked Lunch came the names Clarknova, The Mugwumps and The Insect Trust. The novel Nova Express {{inspired}} the names of Grant Hart's post-Hüsker Dü band Nova Mob, as well as Australian 1960s R band Nova Express. British band Soft Machine took its moniker from the Burroughs novel of the same name. Alt-country band Clem Snide is named for a Burroughs character. <b>Thin</b> <b>White</b> Rope took their name from Burroughs's euphemism for ejaculation.|$|E
25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, {{it may be}} hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly {{rather than the other way}} around. Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their <b>thin</b> <b>white</b> vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E
