40|$|There is a {{need for}} lasers in the 370 nm - 470 nm {{spectrum}} (near ultraviolet - blue) for applications such as high storage, high resolution printers and biomedical applications. GaN-based vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) is one interesting option due to the wide bandgap of the GaN and the 2 D array capability and cost-effective production of VCSELs. Because of the high resistivity of p-GaN, these devices require the use of a transparent conductive film (TCF) to effectively laterally spread the current across the active region. The actual material used so far is ITO wish has problems related to the deposition technique and the constantly increasing price of the material. Graphene, a one atom layer thick (0. 35 nm) graphite derivative 2 D material, stands as a very good option due to its outstanding properties (high mobilities, high transmittance, etc.). In order to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing ITO with a graphene TCF the production, <b>transfer,</b> <b>sheet</b> resistance and contact resistivity to p-GaN have to be investigated and further developed. In this work a low-pressure cold-wall CVD reactor was used for reproducible production of large domains graphene films on 99. 995 % Cu foils of 50 µm. Different transfer techniques were assessed and reproducible graphene transfer was achieved by improving a recently developed method. The method is based on the separation of the graphene from the Cu foil by H 2 bubbles formation {{on the surface of the}} Cu foil that was used as a cathode in an electrolytic cell with aqueous 0. 25 M NaOH solution. Different methods to improve the sheet resistance of the graphene were evaluated (artificially deposited dual layer films, doping with FeCl 3, S 1813 and PVA). Devices were created to characterize the mobility, sheet resistance, carrier concentration, maximum current densities and contact resistivity to p-GaN. A GaN-based LED using a graphene TCF was fabricated and showed efficient current spreading by the graphene based TCF. The results show that graphene is an interesting option for TCF however, more effort is needed to further improve the contact resistivity...|$|E

40|$|The general {{trend in}} the car body {{manufacturing}} industry is towards low-series production and reduction of press lubricants and car weight. The limited use of lubricants, {{in combination with the}} introduction of high and ultrahigh-strength sheet materials, continuously increases the demands on the forming tools. The major cause for tool failure during the forming process is transfer and accumulation of sheet material on the tool surfaces, generally referred to as galling. The adhered material creates unstable frictional conditions and scratching of the tool/sheet interface. To provide the means of forming new generations of sheet materials, development of new tool materialswith improved galling resistance is required, which may include tailored microstructures introducing specific carbides and nitrides, coatings and improved surface finish. In the present work, the galling wear mechanisms in real forming operations have been studied and emulated at a laboratory scale by developing a test equipment. The wear mechanisms, identified in the real forming process, were distinguished into a sequence of events. At the initial stage, local adhesive wear of the <b>sheets</b> led to <b>transfer</b> of <b>sheet</b> material to the tool surfaces. Successive forming operations resulted in growth of the transfer layer with initiation of scratching of the sheets. Finally, scratching changed into severe adhesive wear, associated withgross macroscopic damage. The wear process was successfully repeated in the laboratory test equipment in sliding between several tool materials, ranging from cast iron and conventional ingot cast tool steels, to advanced powder metallurgy tool steel, sliding against medium and high-strength steel sheets. By use of the test equipment, selected tool materials were ranked regarding galling resistance. The controlling mechanism for galling in sheet metal forming is adhesion. The initial <b>sheet</b> material <b>transfer</b> was found to occur, preferably, to the metallic matrix of the tool steels. Hence, the carbides in the particular steels appeared less prone to adhesion as compared to the metallic matrix. Therefore, an improved galling resistance was observed for a tool steel comprising a high amount of small homogeneously distributed carbides offering a low-strength interface to the <b>transferred</b> <b>sheet</b> material. Further, atomic force microscopy showed that nanoscale adhesion was influenced by temperature, with increasing adhesion as temperature increases. A similar dependence was observed at the macroscale where increasing surface temperature led to initiation of severe adhesive wear. The results were in good agreement to the nano scale observations and temperature-induced high adhesion was suggested as a possible mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Graphene oxide (GO) <b>sheets</b> were <b>transferred</b> by Langmuir-Blodgett {{technique}} on Si and SiO 2 /Si substrates. The {{surface pressure}} - area isotherms of 'amphiphilic' GO sheets at the air-water interface {{are found to}} be highly sensitive to subphase pH, which significantly affects their hydrophilicity and the interaction between the sheets. The surface morphology of GO <b>sheets</b> <b>transferred</b> under different subphase and transfer conditions has been studied. RCA- 1 (NH 4 OH:H 2 O 2 :H 2 O - 1 : 1 : 2) treatment of Si is found to be necessary for the <b>transfer</b> of GO <b>sheets.</b> The deposition on RCA- 1 treated Si, is also highly sensitive to the compressibility of the Langmuir monolayer. Thus, transfer of well defined, uniformly distributed and flat GO sheets on Si is possible only in a narrow window of process parameters, namely, subphase pH, target pressure and lifting speed. In contrast, the transfer behavior and morphology of GO sheets on RCA- 1 treated SiO 2 /Si is practically insensitive to changes in subphase pH, target pressure and lifting speed. This behavior is attributed to the uniformly strong hydrophilic character of SiO 2 /Si surface, compared to that of Si. The different behavior of Si surface, even after RCA- 1 treatment, is attributed to its microscopic chemical and topographical inhomogeneities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this study, power-law variation of sheet temperature is considered. By similarity transformation, the governing equations with the boundary conditions are transformed to self-similar nonlinear ordinary differential equations and then those are solved numerically by shooting method. In presence of variable sheet temperature, the variation of temperature is analysed. For larger shrinking rate {{compared to that of}} straining rate, dual solutions for velocity and temperature are obtained.

Whereas, with increasing magnitude of negative power-law exponent heat transfer increases for second solution and for first solution the heat transfer increases for larger shrinking rate and it decreases for smaller shrinking rate. Due to suction heat transfer/absorption increases in all cases and for injection heat transfer/absorption increases for first solution and decreases for second solution. Also, interesting effects of suction/injection and Prandtl number on temperature distribution are observed when the sheet temperature varies (directly/inversely) along the sheet...|$|R
