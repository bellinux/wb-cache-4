5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of <b>the</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and <b>the</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out {{what had been a}} largely agrarian economy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden, {{particularly}} of the carvings, {{as well as}} the repetition of sevens and threes, has inspired many interpretations. The engravings upon which the carvings are based were commonplace in Scotland at the time, and were frequently used in the art of memory, a mnemonic memory technique associated with Freemasonry. The art of memory had become a feature throughout Scottish culture, from the court of Queen Anne, Danish consort of James VI, to the lodges of operative stonemasons. The potential influence of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's symbolic garden at Uraniborg, which was visited by James IV of Scotland in 1590, has also been noted.|$|E

5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with <b>the</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|The motif {{has many}} {{historical}} meanings. First, {{as a scientific}} and secular motif, it was only an astrological and zodiacal symbol. Under the Safavid and the first Qajar kings, it became more associated with Shia Islam. During the Safavid era, the lion and sun stood for the two pillars of society, {{the state and the}} Islamic religion. It became a national emblem during the Qajar era. In the 19th century, European visitors at the Qajar court attributed the lion and sun to remote antiquity; since then, it has acquired a nationalistic interpretation. During the reign of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar and his successors, the form of the motif was substantially changed. A crown was also placed {{on the top of the}} symbol to represent the monarchy. Beginning in the reign of Fat′h-Ali, the Islamic aspect of the monarchy was de-emphasized. This shift affected <b>the</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emblem. The meaning of the symbol changed several times between the Qajar era and the 1979 revolution. The lion could be interpreted as a metaphor for the Shia Imam Ali or it could be symbolizing Rostam, the legendary hero of Iranian mythology. The Sun has alternately been interpreted as symbol of motherland or Jamshid, the mythical Shah of Iran.|$|E

50|$|Due to <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> Maasai religion, a {{great deal}} of {{emphasis}} is placed on <b>the</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> cattle. <b>The</b> Maasai believe that cattle possess <b>the</b> qualities <b>of</b> Enkai. <b>The</b> eating <b>of</b> meat and drinking <b>of</b> milk symbolize <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> man and Ngai as one.

Fans have developed lengthy scientific theories for the seasons, but Martin insists there is a supernatural fantasy explanation instead of a scientific one.

The press rapidly gained notice for publishing beautifully bound, typographically flawless editions of unusual books.

25|$|<b>The</b> {{supposed}} autonomy <b>of</b> Celtic {{civilization in}} Gaul suffered a further setback with Fernand Benoît's study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funereal <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horseman with the serpent-tailed ("anguiforme") daemon, which he {{established as a}} theme of victory over death, and Epona; both he found to be late manifestations <b>of</b> Mediterranean-influenced <b>symbolism,</b> which had reached Gaul through contacts with Etruria and Magna Graecia.

50|$|At {{one time}} the painting, {{completed}} 1662-1663, was known as Woman Weighing Gold, but closer evaluation has determined that the balance in her hand is empty.

25|$|Wiccans generally, {{as well as}} {{some other}} neopagans, tend to {{conceive}} of the universe as polarized into gender opposites of male and female energies. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently <b>the</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horned God is less developed than that of the Goddess.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, in {{the wake}} of renewed debate about <b>the</b> <b>symbolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederate battle flag (which was {{prominently}} featured on the General Lee 's roof and panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes), reruns of the original series were pulled from circulation. Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the General Lee. However many people still make and sell custom General Lee diecast replicas everywhere online.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, {{paramilitary}} {{extremist groups}} such as the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Japanese Red Army and the Shining Path Maoist movement in Peru used red as their color.
