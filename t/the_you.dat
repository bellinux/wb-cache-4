5|$|You Don't Know Jack was {{developed}} by Chicago-based company Jellyvision. <b>The</b> <b>You</b> Don't Know Jack (YDKJ) series, though popular in the 1990s during the rise of gaming on personal computers, had not had an official full release since 1998 with You Don't Know Jack: The Ride. Though Jellyvision offered some web-based You Don't Know Jack games in the interim years, the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s. Though they had considered adapting the game for consoles, and had produced two titles for the original PlayStation, they could only realize You Don't Know Jack games with players at the same keyboard for input. During this time, Jellyvision reinvented itself as Jellyvision Labs, offering its services in business-to-business communication including for tax software from H Block and interviews for Equifax.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} plays as the Kid, Sara is trapped in LeMU instead of Coco; the Kid {{frequently}} has visions of Coco, {{but no one}} else sees her. The group manages to contact the surface, and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the water around, allowing them to escape. After having played the game as both Takeshi and the Kid, the player accesses the final route, in which it is revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017, those the Kid experienced were a recreation, and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034. <b>The</b> <b>You</b> of 2017, whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana, had artificially impregnated herself and given birth to Yubiseiakikana, who took the role of You during the recreation. Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017, carrying with it the disk with Sora's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF. Sara and the Kid are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi's children, and the Kid's real name turns out to be Hokuto. The Kid of 2017, whose name is Ryogo Kaburaki, played the role of Takeshi during the recreation, having stopped aging due to the Cure virus.|$|E

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think), and Fourth Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think).

A small number of brown coal deposits exist in the Geelong region, most notably at Anglesea, {{where it has been}} mined to fuel Alcoa's Anglesea Power Station since 1969.

500|$|One of the {{earliest}} interracial kisses on television occurred in a July 1964 episode of British soap opera Emergency Ward 10, during which characters Louise Mahler (portrayed by Joan Hooley) and Giles Farmer (portrayed by John White) kissed. The scene in which Mahler and Farmer kissed was originally scripted to occur in Mahler's bedroom, but was rewritten so as to occur outdoors, due to concerns it would otherwise be too risqué (the earlier Lloyd Reckord plays had both been shown well after the 9pm adult-content watershed). According to an issue of the Daily Express published after the episode aired, [...] "not a viewer rang-up to complain". In a 2015 interview, conducted prior {{to the discovery of}} <b>the</b> <b>You</b> in Your Small Corner footage, Hooley noted that the historic importance of what had been known as the [...] "first interracial kiss on television" [...] had been inflated in popular memory: ...|$|E
500|$|The Oops!... I Did It Again Tour was {{the third}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It supported her second studio album Oops!...

The tour was announced in February 2000, while Spears {{was in the midst of}} <b>the</b> (<b>You</b> Drive Me) Crazy Tour. The stage was much more elaborate than her previous tours and featured video screens, pyrotechnics and moving platforms. The setlist was composed by songs from her first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again as well as a few covers. Showco was the sound company, who used the PRISM system to adapt the show to each venue. Spears used a handheld microphone and a headset during the shows, while an ADAT was used to replace her voice during energetic dance routines.|$|E

500|$|Allard Laban of Jellyvision Games {{noted that}} {{compared}} to 1995, where the pop culture was [...] "fragmented", {{the onset of}} the Internet and social media made it easier to develop questions for the game. At the same time, with more information and entertainment available, the writers had to be selective about what parts of culture would remain relevant; an example given by Heinrich was that while questions about Seinfeld were okay, questions about Mad About You were not. Jellyvision Games sought comedy writers, including from local comedy clubs such as Second City and I.O., narrowing down the pool of applicants from hundreds to six, including Second City comedian Tim Sniffen, who had worked on previous iterations of <b>the</b> <b>You</b> Don't Know Jack series. A weekly training process was employed to bring the new writers up to speed and review previously written dialog for possible improvements. Heinrich also assured that material was not repeated throughout the game's script. Heinrich estimates that each question in the game was a result of about two hours of work.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from <b>the</b> <b>You</b> Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the game's dialogue is provided by Tom Gottlieb, brother of Harry, who had voiced the emcee [...] "Cookie" [...] Masterson in the earlier games, and had been {{considered one of the}} more popular emcees by players. Lacking any professional studio, most of the 100-200 hrs of game dialog were recorded in a makeshift soundproofed closet. Tom Gottlieb was also involved in the writing process, as Jellyvision Games credits much of the [...] "Cookie" [...] persona to his own performance of the character. Other sound effects include fake commercials that are heard before and after a game; some of these include commercials used in previous iterations of <b>the</b> <b>You</b> Don't Know Jack series. Prior to each questions, the game includes short musical interstitials with animated numbers to introduce the question via its number. These were designed as to get the music for these stuck in the players' heads as something they would remember throughout the day; to avoid making these become too routine, certain episodes featured variations on the interstitial that would be unexpected, keeping players on their toes throughout playing the game.|$|E
