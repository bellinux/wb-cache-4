The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>off</b> green fumes. Other character details include Preston's background in tracking down AWOL soldiers {{as well as the}} process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned that the message was somehow routed through several black holes to mask its point of origin.|$|E

500|$|Nepenthes rajah {{seems to}} flower {{at any time}} of the year. [...] Flowers are {{produced}} in large numbers on inflorescences that arise from the apex of the main stem. [...] N. rajah produces a very large inflorescence that can be 80cm, and sometimes even 120cm [...] tall. [...] The individual flowers of N. rajah are produced on partial peduncles (twin stalks) and so the inflorescence is called a raceme (as opposed to a panicle for multi-flowered bunches). [...] The flowers are reported <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>off</b> a strong sugary smell and are brownish-yellow in colour. Sepals are elliptic to oblong and ≤8mm long. Like all Nepenthes species, N. rajah is dioecious, which means that individual plants produce flowers of a single sex. [...] Fruits are orange-brown and 10 to 20mm long (see [...] ). A study of 300 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (J.H.Adam 2443, collected at an altitude of 1930–2320m) found the mean pollen diameter to be 34.7μm (SE = 0.3; CV = 7.0%).|$|E

500|$|The {{technology}} used in constructing skyscrapers continued to develop. Time was increasingly {{a factor in}} the projects, and architects and their specialist teams developed faster ways to design and construct the buildings to minimise the interest payments during construction and hasten the arrival of rental income. By 1930, skyscrapers were being erected in just 12 months by teams of workers totalling 5,000 men, with four floors being assembled in a typical week. Building skyscraper towers involved some adaption of engineering techniques, as effectively two different buildings were being designed – the base and the tower – which needed to be efficiently linked using elevators and other service facilities. Most new offices settled around a standard size, [...] wide by [...] deep, depending on the height of the ceiling, with multiple small windows considered better than a few larger ones.

2500|$|The compact central {{object is}} {{consuming}} the companion star which rapidly loses mass into an accretion disc formed around the [...] central object.

[...] The material in the jets travels at 26% of the speed of light., pp.2324; , p.508.

2500|$|Mating {{occurs at}} {{reproductive}} aggregation sites. Secretions from the mandibular glands of males initially mark these sites. The secretions attract females, {{as well as}} additional males, resulting in strong male competition for mates. The system of mating within P. barbatus [...] is comparable to lek behavior performed by many vertebrate species. The male ants congregate and collectively give off a pheromone that attracts reproductive females. The more males present <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>off</b> the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females. Although this practice strongly favors certain males and leaves many others without mates, the congregation of males attracts more females on the whole as opposed to pheromone release {{on behalf of a}} solitary male. Consequently, it is more desirable for the less attractive males to remain in the lek than to attempt to attract females on their own.|$|E

Immediately after Ulam's breakthrough, John von Neumann understood its importance and programmed the ENIAC computer to carry out Monte Carlo calculations. In 1946, physicists at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory were investigating radiation shielding and the distance that neutrons would likely travel through various materials. Despite having most of the necessary data, such as the average distance a neutron would travel in a substance before it collided with an atomic nucleus, and how much energy the neutron was likely <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>off</b> following a collision, the Los Alamos physicists were unable to solve the problem using conventional, deterministic mathematical methods.

2500|$|Preconceptions {{about what}} is an ‘Australian film’ contributed to the {{difficulty}} in finding funding. As an action film, Gabriel [...] "defied the norm and went way outside convention."

These types of movies are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>off</b> a reasonable return to investors. The consequence {{of this is that}} the Australian finance and investment sectors have been reluctant to support the funding of the movie industry." [...] Abbess is critical of contemporary Australian films, joking that audiences [...] "fall asleep" [...] through them. He also believes there is a mentality in the Australian film industry to wait for government funding, rather than to earn and finance your own films.
