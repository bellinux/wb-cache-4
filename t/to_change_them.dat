25|$|The regular {{spelling}} {{system of}} Old English was {{swept away by}} the Norman Conquest, and English itself was supplanted in some spheres by Norman French for three centuries, eventually emerging with its spelling much influenced by French. English had also borrowed large numbers of words from French, which naturally kept their French spellings as {{there was no reason}} or mechanism <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>them.</b> The spelling of Middle English, such as in the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer, is very irregular and inconsistent, with the same word being spelled in different ways, sometimes even in the same sentence. However, these were generally much better guides to the then pronunciation than modern English spelling is.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the small}} number of Chinese {{surnames}} leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the Chinese public security bureau stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>them</b> so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.|$|E

25|$|From {{at least}} {{the time of the}} Shang dynasty, the Han Chinese {{observed}} a number of naming taboos regulating {{who may or may not}} use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures—particularly emperors—used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>them.</b> The normalization of personal names after the May Fourth Movement has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.|$|E

After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much since I had been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't like any of the three [...] characters", but decided not <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>them</b> and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|On August 30, 2000, the EPB sent {{a letter}} to the United States Congress citing {{previous}} attempt at communication and questioning if a lack of response was motivated by the legislators being more willing to satisfy traditional politicians in exchange for benefits. The organization then accused the territorial politics of the United States of perpetuating a crime against humanity by letting Puerto Rico carry with the negative consequences of the status quo. The Macheteros denied that they were motivated by hatred or a spirit of revenge, claiming that such a portrayal in the media and other outlets was an attempt to manipulate the public and international community (Latin America in particular) led by the FBI and the Navy, who publicly referred to the organization as [...] "terrorists", self-describing themselves as lovers of peace that acted against a lack of justice and equality. The EPB also cited its beliefs that the current generation of American politicians had moved away from the founding fathers and adopted expansionist politics. The organization called the Vieques protests a response to the political divisions promoted by these politics and cited it as an opportunity for Congress <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>them.</b> Citing that despite being a pacific people, Puerto Ricans are known to fight for what they perceive as fair, the EPB warned that their actions would continue and this was not meant as a threat, but rather a response. The Macheteros then argued that invading and annexing Puerto Rico as part of the Spanish–American War constituted a violation of international law since the autonomy granted in 1897 placed it en route to become a separate entity. The EPB also expressed that the influence of the United States prevent the actions of other UN members. The organization then recapitulated several events, including the campaigns of Albizu, the Blair house incident and the Congress shooting, and their own actions, discussing them as responses to the perpetuation of the status quo. Additionally, the group condemned the militarization of the archipelago and the unsanctioned medical experimentation with the population. The examples given included the devaluation of the Puerto Rican dollar, the imposition of the Jones Act, the illegal experiments with cancer cells by Cornelius Rhodes, the addition of pesticides to the water supply in an attempt to kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the testing of anticonceptive drugs on the unsuspecting public by Enovid, military tests with Agent Orange, a number of massacres in confrontations between the public and Congress appointed governors, the acquisition of Vieques and Culebra by the Navy, intelligence efforts to monitor and arrest independence supporters and the general public, a covert cocaine plantation with the intention of testing different methods to exterminate the plant and a program that intended to examine the effects of radiation on the local flora and fauna by the Atomic Energy Commission. Concluding with a call to pursue justice or face the consequences.|$|E
