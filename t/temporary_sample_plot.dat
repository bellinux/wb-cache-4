A detailed description is provided of the models predicting regeneration, growth and mortality, together with auxiliary models required for the simulation of stand development. Models were developed to be applicable for the all tree species and on all the forest site types throughout the Finland. The model input were restricted to those variables that are measurable in large-scale forest inventories. Extensive data from repeatedly measured inventory growth plots and permanent sample plots {{were used in the}} model development. Most of the models in the simulation system can be categorized as individual-tree, distance independent models. After model building they were evaluated and calibrated using the <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> data from the 8 th National Forest Inventory. The purpose was to calibrate the predicted growth to the average level obtained from the growth measurements of national forest inventory, and obtain the growth predictions also for those tree species, and site types that were poorly represented in the modelling data...|$|E

Height-diameter models {{can be used as}} necessary inputs to growth and yield models and growth simulation systems. The researchers developed height-diameter models with 364 Blue pine (Pinus wallichiana) tree data from Lete and Kunjo Village Development Committees (VDCs) of Mustang district. Eighteen non-linear models were calibrated, among which, Weibull model described the largest proportion of height variation (R 2 adj = 0. 9362). Gunary and Chapman-Richards ’ models also appeared almost identical to Weibull model in terms of fi t statistics and graphical appearance. The researchers recommend Weibull model for predicting total heights of Blue pine trees for the VDCs covered by the study. Key words: Blue pine, height-diameter models, modelling, Mustang district The measurements of individual tree height and diameter are essential component of forest inventories. Tree heights are used for estimating volume, site index, growth and yield, succession and carbon budget models (Peng, 2001). Although, theoretically, height can be measured on standing trees, practically, it is expensive, tedious and time consuming due to stand conditions and land confi gurations. Therefore, with many permanent or <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> systems, diameters for all trees, but height of only a few sample trees are measured. Alternatively, indirect estimation of tree heights can be made from diameter at breast height (dbh) which can be easily and accurately measured in relatively low cost. But for this, a site-and species-specific model describing a height-diameter relationship is necessary. Height-diameter model can be developed using accurately measured heights and diameters from individual trees sampled from every stand within a forest. Height-diameter models are used to predict missing heights on the stands or permanent sampl...|$|E

The data were obtained from 1. 45 ha <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> of size 25 m x 25 m. The data consisted of dbh measurement of all the trees with dbh ≥ 10 cm in each plots. The data were sorted into species, families and dbh size classes. The models were developed using four – parameters Beta functions. Simple linear regression equation was used to fit the models {{for each of the}} parameters. To ascertain the accuracy and efficiency of the models, two-third of the data set was used for model validation which should not be significance to the observed values. The best model from each parameters were selected based on least values of mean residuals, standard deviation of residuals, sum of squares of residuals, coefficient of variation of residuals; significance and high coefficient of determination. The result revealed that sixty-two (62) tree species were present in the study area. Higher proportions of the trees were in the smaller diameter classes which is typical of natural forest. The maximum dbh observed was 98. 4 cm while the least was 10. 0 cm. The models fitted for each parameter are: (a+b) = 0. 80 lnDq – 200. 79 (R 2 = 61. 31 %, SE = 20. 13 and p = 0. 0003), b = 0. 80 lnDq – 210. 78 (R 2 = 64. 06 %, SE = 24. 78 and p = 0. 0003), (p+q) = 6. 78 – 0. 59 lnDq (R 2 = 34. 37 %, SE = 0. 68 and p = 0. 0216) and q = 5. 70 – 0. 55 lnDq (R 2 = 24. 76 %, SE = 0. 6343 and p = 0. 0041).

(Carr.), in the Buchan area of north-east Scotland, using General Yield Class (GYC) as a site index. The degree of correlation between GYC and Land Classification for Forestry (LCF) class was also investigated. Data collected from 90 <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were analysed using Principal Components Analysis and stepwise multiple regression. A model was constructed which accounted for 44. 9 per cent of variation in GYC, with an f statistic significant at the 1 per cent level. For a 95 per cent confidence interval, any single new prediction made by the model should be within +/- 3. 6 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1 of the true value. Validation using independent data from a further 10 <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> gave a mean difference between observed and expected values of only 0. 25 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1. No significant difference was found between the means of GYC recorded from plots on LCF classes 4, 5 and 6. The results of the study could be used to support the process of conversion of agricultural land to conifer plantation, and are pertinent to the development of more proactive policies by local authorities towards consultative rural development planning procedures...|$|R

Inputs used in the FCP include stand basal area, mean top height, stocking, silvicultural management regime (initial stocking, pruning and thinning ages and intensities), and site factors (mean annual air temperature, soil fertility, needle retention). These data were obtained from <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> installed at each biomass study site and were used as model inputs to predict dry matter stocks in live and dead organic matter pools annually over a rotation, following methods given in Beets et al.

40|$|Crimean pine {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plantation and natural species in Turkey. In spite of this importance, information on the growth and yield of this species is lacking. For this reason, a model for growth and yield in crimean pine plantations is described, in which stand development is derived from relation to age and site index. Data were collected from 115 <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> from plantations ranging in age from 3 to 50 years. Site index curves and empirical yield tables were developed and presented. Site index curves were used to classify plantations into site classes of I, II and III, in order of decreasing productivity. Yield functions indicate that crimean pine can be grown on biologically optimum rotations of 35, 36 and 37 years on site classes I, II and III, respectively. The models can be calibrated on permanent field plot data and tested against independent long term growth and yield records...|$|R
40|$|Quality factors {{affecting}} the assortment quality structure in poplar plantations were researched on nine <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> {{in the period}} 1997 - 2004, from the aspect of the implementation of roundwood standards. <b>Sample</b> <b>plots</b> were selected depending on the factors, the effect of which was studied. The following factors were researched: clonal species, planting pattern, flood risk, pruning of branches, plantation position and age. The study was performed by the original methodology. Based on the study results, it is concluded that knots have the highest effect on the assortment quality structure in poplar plantations, regardless of the site and stand conditions. Their effect rises significantly {{with the increase of}} tree diameter. Also, the analyses show that the number of large and rotten knots on the tree trunk increases considerably with the older age. In the flooded area, the sweep of {{the lower part of the}} stem is more intensive and multiple curvatures are frequent on the trees growing immediately along the river, whereas curvature decreases with the distance from the river bank.

A simple linear correlation between the used variables differed from those traditionally found results for volume of stands. This result was also observed in the fitting of mathematical models by stepwise, in which the variable average height didn’t compose any adjusted model. Although efficient, selected traditional equations were less accurate than the equations adjusted by stepwise, reinforcing the importance and improving that this method represents to modeling studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Global {{warming is}} the {{phenomenon}} {{in which the}} accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere produces the increase of the global average temperature. Carbon dioxide {{is one of the}} main responsible for the “extended ” greenhouse effect. The release of this gas mostly obeys to anthropogenic activities effect. Plants contribute to store the atmospheric CO 2 through the photosynthesis and biomass production. The forests capability to store carbon is well known around the world, however in Ecuador there is insufficient information about this topic. This paper presents the research conducted in order to quantify the carbon stored in two soil use systems. Pastures with and without shade were analyzed during the study. Both soil use systems are located in the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve. <b>Temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> of 500 m 2 were installed in three towns of Napo Province. The <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were divided in several smaller plots and trial pits. All storage components of woody and herbaceous strata were analyzed. The obtained data were expressed in tons per hectare of estimated CO 2. The results of the study showed on one hand, that the main storage component in both soil use systems was the soil; whereas, forage production was higher in system without shade.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{forestry}} incentives {{mean that there}} is potential {{for an increase in}} afforestation on better quality agricultural land in Scotland. As a result improved information is required about timber yields from a range of species on better quality sites for production forecasting, financial appraisal, and planning at the local, regional and strategic levels. This paper describes the development of models that enable General Yield Class (GYC) to be predicted from site factors for Douglas fir, Japanese larch and Scots pine. <b>Temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were established in stands below 350 m on Land Capability for Forestry class I to V sites. At each location GYC was assessed, as well as the soil, climate and topographic factors which had been demonstrated to influence forest productivity in earlier studies in Scotland. The models, based on a step-wise multiple regression procedure, indicate that mean spring temperature, geomorphic shelter (topex), and crop age are most important in determining the productivity of Douglas fir and Japanese larch. For Scots pine, mean spring temperature, mean winter temperature, and crop age are the most important factors. The models accounted for between 34 and 45 per cent of variation in General Yield Class and are sufficiently precise for estimating mean productivity at regional and national levels...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} and balanced material {{is the first}} prerequisite for forest yield research to provide guidance for practical forestry in important yield problems. In 1941, fieldwork was begun at the then Swedish Institute of Experimental Forestry for a new, large-scale Yield Investigation. The present author, at the time Head of Section at the Institute, planned in detail the Investigation. The fieldwork was completed in 1965. During the long period of collection of the material, parts of it were processed by research workers for various purposes, and the results published. However, {{there has been no}} full account of the reasoning and motives underlying the planning and detailed configuration of the Investigation. This paper aims to provide such an account {{and at the same time}} to review the very extensive and detailed material collected. The Investigation was planned to use a large number of <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> laid out both in untouched stands and in stands thinned according to forestry practice; thus pure stands of pine, spruce and birch and mixed stands of these species, are covered by the study.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{potential}} of diameter growth of Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze. at different sites in Southern Brazil was analyzed. The objectives were to obtain information {{for the management of}} this species in uneven-aged mixed stands for high value timber production focused on future crop trees. The material consisted of 400 trees of native forests and plantations growing under varying site conditions and treatments in the states of Santa Catarina, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul. The research method applied was an ex-post facto (observational) one that is based on an explorative data analysis of data taken from 16 <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> each consisting of 25 araucarias. For each plot it was made a stem and crown distribution map. The study shows that crown width is a very good estimator for diameter growth and it is closely related to the easy measurable variable diameter at 1. 30 m. This relationship was used to develop decision tools based on the management of the growing space of the individual tree. The maximum crown expansion at a given age and therefore also the maximum radial increment are strongly related to site quality. That means that site quality has to be considered as a limiting factor for the production goals in araucaria stands. Decision tools have to be adapted to these circumstances. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{factors of}} quality which affect the sawing yield were {{researched}} for poplar plantations, from {{the aspect of}} the application of national standards for roundwood. The research was performed in the period 2002 - 2003 on two <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> in poplar plantations Populus×euramericana I- 214 aged 25 years. The <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were selected depending on the clone species, planting pattern, and plantation flood risk, and branch pruning. The analyzed quality factors are: knots, minimal dimensions, sweep, false heart, ovality and tapering. The measured data were processed according to the original methodology. Based on the study results, the significance of quality factors was ranked in two different stand situations. Of all the study factors, knots have the highest effect on log yield, which is especially significant in marking for cross cutting of the larger trees. The sweep of trees in poplar plantations with higher flood risk is greater compared to the sweep of trees in plantations which are in the zone protected from floods. In poplar plantation Populus×euramericana I- 214 which is exposed to frequents flooding (OP- 2), sweep is the third significant factor, compared to the plantation protected from floods (OP‑ 3), where sweep is the fifth factor according to significance. The effect of sweep in the plantation exposed to flooding is 2. 4 {{times higher than the}} effect of sweep in the plantation protected from floods. Total value of the assortments made of tree trunk grows with the increase of tree diameter on both <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> This correlation is represented by the function Y=a·Xb, and the correlation between the variables is complete. The value of assortments of a certain quality for the study stand conditions can be calculated by the selected model functions, i. e. represented by assortment tables.

40|$|In this study, biomass {{models for}} the above- and belowground tree {{components}} of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst) and birch (Betula pendula and Betula pupescens) were compiled, and complementary equations developed for average stem density. The models were based on 1684 sample trees collected in 101 stands located on mineral soil sites, comprising 41 pine, 36 spruce and 24 birch stands. The study material consisted of subjectively selected experiments and <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> representing {{a wide range of}} stand and site conditions in Finland. The models were estimated for individual tree components: stem wood, stem bark, living and dead branches, foliage, stump, and roots. A linear mixed model technique was applied in analyzing the data, and logarithmic transformation was used to convert the model to a linear form. Two model sets were developed. The simple models were mainly based on tree diameter and height, and the full models on all the variables measured in the Finnish national forest inventory. The generalization and applicability of the models may be restricted {{by the fact that the}} study material was not an objective, representative sample of the tree stands in Finland, and some tree components (stump and roots and birch foliage) were poorly represented. Despite these shortcomings, the models provided uniform biomass predictions for a number of tree components, apart from stump and root biomass for pine, and were comparable with other functions used in Finland and Sweden (Hakkila 1972, 1979, 1991, Marklund 1988, Petersson 1999, 2006) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{crown of}} tree is the centre of {{physiological}} activity which gives {{an indication of the}} potential photosynthetic capacity on a tree. Though, its measurement remains a challenge in forest inventory task. The ability to predict crown diameter from stump diameter provides an effective technique of obtaining its estimate. This helps in detecting the excessive tree felling than actual requirements and wildlife suitability. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop and test crown diameter prediction models for silvicultural management of naturally grown Parkia biglobosa within the University of Agriculture, Makurdi. Nine 100 m x 100 m <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were established using simple random sampling method. Crown diameter and stump diameter were measured in all living P. biglobosa trees with stump diameter ≥ 10. 0 cm. Least square method was used to convert the counted stumps into harvested crown dimension. Three linear and three non-linear models using stump diameter as the exploratory variable were developed and evaluated using the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj.

The crown-stump diameter relationship was best described by the double logarithmic function with. The result showed that Crown diameter estimation was feasible even when the only information available is stump diameter.

Conversely, assessment of crown dimensions still remain {{one of the most difficult}} and tedious task in forestry. The difficult measurements and the sensitivity of crown dimension on management makes it desirable to develop estimation procedures based on variables that are easier to measure than crown extension itself. The main objective of this study was to develop and observe the effects of tree slenderness coefficient in predicting crown area for Tectona grandis in Omo Forest Reserve. Twenty <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> of size 20 m x 20 m were randomly selected across the stand ages (9, 11, 12 and 18 years). Tree growth variables measured from each plot include diameter at breast height (Dbh) ≥ 5 cm, total height (THt) and crown diameter (CD). The data was analysed using descriptive, correlation and regression analyses. Amidst the models developed and verified, double logarithmic function with adj. R 2 = 62. 0 %, RMSE = 0. 265 % and PRESS = 0. 263 gave the best fit and predictive ability. This was also supported by the undeviating bands of the graphical analyses of the residual. Conversely, the inclusion of TSC had impact on the predictive abilities of the models which implies that slenderness coefficient typically indicates the size of crown dimension, centre of gravity and a better developed root system. Therefore, it is recommended that the model can be used by forest managers for the development of stocking guideline...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the production of cedar wood in agroforestry systems (AF) with coffee, using a prediction model of the commercial volume obtained in the study area, as well as the profitability generated by the sale of coffee, wood and payment for environmental services (PPSA). The study was carried out in the canton of Pérez Zeledón, province of San José, Costa Rica. There were established 30 <b>temporary</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> of 1000 m 2 in AF with cedar between five and 17 years of age. The diameter growth (DBH) and the commercial height (CH) of the species were evaluated, as well as the management of the SAF (activities, inputs and yields) and coffee production through the producer interview. The obtained models allowed to predict the commercial volume (m 3 tree- 1) according to age (R 2 = 88. 7 %), DBH (R 2 = 90. 3 %) and CH (R 2 = 97. 2 %). The average coffee production of the sampled sites was 26 fanegas ha- 1 year- 1. At the age of 17 years of the cedar, a production of 1. 04 m 3 tree- 1 (92. 13 m 3 ha- 1) of standing timber was obtained, which represented a financial contribution of 81 % of the net present value (NPV) of the AF in the analysis period.

To help identify sites most suited {{for the production of}} high quality timber, where the potential return on silvicultural investments should be the highest, this study assessed the impact of stand and site characteristics on timber quality in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.). For this purpose, lumber value recovery (LVR), an estimate of the summed value of boards contained in a unit volume of round wood, was used as an indicator of timber quality. Predictions of LVR were made for yellow birch and sugar maple trees contained in a network of more than 22000 <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> across the Province. Next, stand-level variables were selected and models to predict LVR were built using the boosted regression trees method. Finally, the occurrence of spatial clusters was verified by a hotspot analysis. Results showed that in both species LVR was positively correlated with the stand age and structural diversity index, and negatively correlated with the number of merchantable stems. Yellow birch had higher LVR in areas with shallower soils, whereas sugar maple had higher LVR in regions with deeper soils. The hotspot analysis indicated that clusters of high and low LVR exist across the province for both species. Although it remains uncertain to what extent the variability of LVR may result from variations in past management practices or in inherent site quality, we argue that efforts to produce high quality timber should be prioritized in sites where LVR is predicted to be the highest...|$|R

New studies include a 10 -year-old stand in Southland, a 9 - and a 19 -year-old stand in Canterbury, a 21 -year-old stand in Southern Kaingaroa, a 28 -year-old stand in Northern Kaingaroa, and a 31 -year-old stand in Whakarewarewa forest near Rotorua. Stand attributes were measured in <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> installed at each site. Measurements were taken of stocking rate, basal area, mean top height, dry weight of biomass components (foliage, branches, stem wood, stem bark), stem volume (over- and under-bark), the mass of dead wood and litter, as well as outerwood basic density at breast height (1.4 [*]m aboveground). The number of annually produced needle-age classes retained in the lower third of the green crown of a sample tree was counted and the mean needle retention of sample trees calculated for each plot. Most cones had been shed, and these were weighed {{as part of the}} forest floor. Attached cones, if present, were weighed with the branches. Root biomass was measured at one site in northern Kaingaroa. The forest floor (LFH, ash free) was measured at most sites, although negligible litter was present in young stands. The mass was assumed to be zero in such cases. For example, at the 10 -year-old stand at Gowan Hill and the 9 -year-old stand at Forest Creek, Douglas-fir litter was mostly absent, which was to be expected because needle retention was reasonably high in these stands (4 – 5 [*]years of retained material). Deadwood at the Northern Kaingaroa (thinned to 800 trees ha− 1 at age 16) and Whakarewarewa (thinned to 750 trees ha− 1 at age 18) sites was measured 12 and 13 [*]years, respectively following thinning. Although the sapwood and stem bark were present, some hollowing and collapse of sapwood was evident. However, the heartwood was sound.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate altitudinal and geographical variation in the productivity of Sitka spruce in upland Scotland, to relate this to environmental variables and to use the information to develop a basis for predicting Sitka spruce yield form site factors. A total of 188 0. 04 ha <b>temporary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were established in 15 to 50 year old Sitka spruce stands at 37 sites in Scotland and northern England, mostly spanning the upper 200 m elevation range of plantations. At each plot estimates of General Yield Class (GYC) were made and the following site factors were assessed; elevation, geomorphic shelter (topex), aspect, slope, soil type and rooting depth. In addition, estimates of wind-climate, mean summer temperature (June-September), mean annual accumulated temperature > 5. 6 °C and annual rainfall were made by extrapolation of forestry Commission "tatter flag" records and Meteorological Office data. GYC declined by about 3. 2 - 4. 0 m 3 ha - 1 yr - 1 per 100 m increase in elevation due to the effects of increasingly adverse climatic and edaphic conditions, GYC was fairly closely correlated with elevation at the individual sites, but there was considerable site to site variation. GYC values at specific elevations were higher in inland and southern areas than in coastal and northern ones. The geographical pattern of the relationship between GYC and elevation was strikingly similar to the distributions of growing season temperatures and wind-climate. Correlation and multiple regression analysis demonstrated that GYC was well correlated with extrapolated values of accumulated temperature and tatter rate, these two variables accounting for up to 78 per cent of the variation in GYC in the best multiple regression models. GYC also proved to be correlated with aspect, topex, soil type and crop age. Productivity was highest on north and east-facing aspects and increased with greater levels of geomorphic shelter. Differences in soil type only accounted for a small amount of variation in GYC (2 - 3 per cent). GYC was significantly negatively correlated with crop age, probably as a result of improved standards of silvicultural treatment. The best multiple regression models accounted for 78 - 86 per cent of the variation in GYC and were associated with confidence limits of ± 2. 2 - 2. 6 m 3 ha - 1 yr - 1. The mean figure for predicting GYC for a single site (acquisition) was calculated to be ± m 3 ha - 1 yr - 1, and this figure was confirmed by results of a validation survey. The information presented could easily be adapted for predicting productivity and assessing suitable upper planting limits in practical forestry...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{studies are}} {{supporting}} foresters’ perceptions {{that the site}} indices of British Columbia’s old-growth stands are being underestimated. A province- wide paired-plot study resulted in old-growth site index adjustments for coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii), interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss, P. engelmannii (Parry) Engelm., and P. glauca x P. engelmannii), and interior lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Dougl.). The objective {{of this study is}} to develop adjustments for species not covered in the provincial project. Adjustments for the species in the provincial project are also derived for comparison purposes. The data for this study come from <b>temporary</b> and permanent <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> with a veteran and a main stand component. The site indices for the two components were estimated and an adjustment equation for each species was derived using the two site indices in a linear regression analysis. The veteran component represents an old-growth stand and the main stand component represents a managed stand. The analysis showed that the veteran site indices were being underestimated. Some guidelines on the application of these adjustments to old-growth site indices are provided...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Since its formation, the Forestry Commission has {{upheld a}} {{commitment}} {{to establish and maintain}} a network of permanent mensuration <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> The principal use of <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> data is for calibration of models of forest growth and yield, but <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> are ubiquitous in their applications and a wide range of research projects have depended on <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> as a key source of data. The objectives of this report are to provide an overview of the Forestry Commission <b>Sample</b> <b>Plot</b> Research programme, to summarise the data available from <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> records and to consider the potential applications of <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> data and the potential role of <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> in research into the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. In general, the pattern of <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> establishment has followed a strategy aimed at underpinning development and validation of yield models, with roughly equal numbers of plots representing the key and emerging tree species. The <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> network has provided, and continues to provide, a national reserve of periodic growth and yield data to support measurement, growth and yield studies. The current permanent plot network covers a wide range of species, sites, yield classes an...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Forest and Wood Science)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{present study}} {{investigated}} double sampling with regression estimators as {{a quest for}} efficiency and effectiveness in forest inventory in Namibian woodlands. Auxiliary data used were obtained from Standard QuickBird satellite scenes (phase 1) for Hans Kanyinga Community Forest from October and November 2004 covering an area of 12, 107 hectares, amplified with terrestric data (phase 2) of 2002. The relationships between auxiliary and terrestric variables are described and prediction models were constructed. According {{to the results of}} the stepwise procedure with the Mallow’s Cp statistic as the selection criteria, photogrammetric stand density and a combination of the photogrammetric crown area with photogrammetric stand density were the best candidates for predicting the stand volume. The resulting volume model explains 56 % of the variation. Photogrammetric stand density was found to be highly correlated to the terrestric stand density with the resulting model explaining 81 % of the variation. Photogrammetric crown diameter was found to be correlated with the diameter at breast height measured from the plots which were assessed for spatial tree positions, which enabled the derivation of the diameter distribution. The diameter distribution model explains 43 % of the variation. In addition, the actual tree positions were determined using the GPS and surveying techniques (polar positions) involving distance and bearings. GPS tree positions showed a considerable shift of up to 8. 67 m. However, only the distance measurements of tress from the plot centre using the infield surveying methods were more reliable. Nevertheless, the influences of the tree positional errors are not of high concern for <b>temporary</b> based <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> which are normally used in Namibian forest inventories. A reduction in inventory cost was found to be 24 % i. e. N$ 25. 79 to N$ 19. 67 per hectare. The results of this study are valid for Kavango region or any other region with similar set of physical and climatic conditions, but caution must be exercised in implementing these results elsewhere under different physical and environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Procedures for {{monitoring}} {{the growth of}} forest plantations, principally in the tropics, are presented. These include methods of setting up a system of both, <b>temporary</b> and permanent <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> located objectively within managed plantations and replicated field experiments. The experiments test the effects of silvicultural management on tree- and stand-growth patterns. Together the information collected provides {{the basis for the}} management of the plantation (in the form of volume and yield tables and functions) and for detecting site change, for example when applied to related studies on tree water use and nutrient cycling. Methods for collection of data in the field and its processing using small personal computers is suggested. Recommendations for the assessment of above- and below-ground phytomass production are given in addition to procedures for measuring and recording the conventional tree and stand variables. While it is assumed that the reader has some familiarity with forest mensuration and sampling techniques, attention is drawn to particular sources of error that are likely to arise in practice. Chapter one details the scope of the manual and the objectives of a growth monitoring system in forest plantations. Chapter two is an elementary summary of the steps to be taken in planning a continuous forest inventory. Chapter three gives details on how to layout the different types of <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> in the field wi th step by step instructions on how to record the measurements and observations. This is followed by details of summarizing the data file, with information on spreadsheets, databases and other packages. The final chapter argues that a number of complimentary controlled experiments are required to test the effects of stand density, fertilization and other treatments {{in order to understand the}} results of the continuous forest inventory correctly. Some model 'experimental' plans are provided. Model field forms are included as an aid memoire to planners of continuous inventory and monitoring programmes. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-phase}} {{sampling design}} {{has been applied}} to forest inventory. First, a large number of fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were defi ned with a square grid in a geographic coordinate system for two study areas of about 1800 and 4500 ha. The fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were supplied by auxiliary data of Landsat TM and IRS- 1 C with principal component transformation for stratifi cation and drawing the second phase sample (fi eld sample). Proportional allocation was used to draw the second phase sample. The number of fi eld <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> in the two study areas was 300 and 380. The local estimates of fi ve continuous forest stand variables, mean diameter, mean height, age, basal area, and stem volume, were calculated for each of the fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> This was done separately by using one auxiliary data source at a time together with the fi eld sample information. However, if the fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> for which the stand variables were to be estimated was also a fi eld <b>sample</b> <b>plot,</b> the information of that fi eld <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> was eliminated according to the cross validation principle. This was because it was then possible to calculate mean square errors of estimates related to a specifi c auxiliary data source...|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} step, a grid fishnet was created with cell size {{equal to the}} area of a single <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> (500  m 2) and {{overlaid}} on the study area. For each cell of the grid, the same SVs (as those for <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> presented in Table  1) were computed. Finally, starting from the focal <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> adjacent grids were spatially merged to each <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> only if (i) their values were inside earlier computed delineation thresholds for the given variant (dynamic, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %), and (ii) adjacent pixels that met the first assumption could create spatially constant polygons. We allowed that patches could overlap each other. After obtaining all layers representing HPs based on two SVs separately, spatial intersections of polygons representing HPs of both variables per each ground <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> were also created (p 95 [*]×[*]pFRAMe (Intersection)).|$|R
