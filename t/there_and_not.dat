5|$|In 1884, Tchaikovsky {{began to}} shed his unsociability and restlessness. That March, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which {{included}} a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar. This {{was seen as a}} seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky's social standing and might have been cemented in the composer's mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg. In 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. By having the opera staged <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> at the Mariinsky Theatre, he served notice that Tchaikovsky's music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, thanks to Ivan Vsevolozhsky, Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the Tsar. This made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in actual title.|$|E

Rodríguez Castelao {{developed}} an emotional attachment with Pontevedra and frequently claimed {{he wanted to be}} considered a native of that city; he even expressed a will to be buried <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> back in his original Rianxo or elsewhere. Also in 1916, he participated in the Asembleia Nazonalista de Lugo ("Nationalist Assembly of Lugo"), signing a declaration for the history of Galician nationalism.|$|E

25|$|Rise {{says that}} the white {{community}} disdained Ruby Floyd for her missionary work with the Jehovah's Witnesses and for her willingness to enter the black part of Martinsville. The prosecution pointed out that Floyd had had gone to an area considered unsafe for white women, ignored warnings of black residents of staying too long <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> been attentive to her surroundings or the men she passed. A relative of the Hairstons has said that their family tradition always said that Floyd had been {{having an affair with}} one of the defendants, but this was not explored at trial.|$|E

And I applaud her for that." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{controversy}} emerged over {{changing the}} language of [...] "Baa Baa Black Sheep" [...] in Britain from 1986, because, it was alleged in the popular press, it was seen as racially dubious. This was based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery as an exercise for the children <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> on any local government policy. A similar controversy emerged in 1999 when reservations about the rhyme were submitted to Birmingham City Council by a working group on racism in children's resources, which were never approved or implemented. Two private nurseries in Oxfordshire in 2006 altered the song to [...] "Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep", with black being replaced {{with a variety of}} other adjectives, like [...] "happy, sad, hopping" [...] and [...] "pink". In 2012, a private nursery in Kingston upon Thames replaced [...] "black" [...] with [...] "little" [...] for their Easter show. Commentators have asserted that these controversies have been exaggerated or distorted by some elements of the press as part of a more general campaign against political correctness.|$|E

500|$|As the {{daughter}} of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she {{earned a reputation as}} a [...] "wild child," [...] which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, [...] "I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand." [...] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, [...] "I'm so in love with my brother right now." [...] She dismissed the rumors, saying, [...] "It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus," [...] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.|$|E
500|$|When the Archduke {{heard of}} Hotze's success in taking Winterthur crossroads, he {{directed}} his troops to augment Nauendorf's, {{and to take}} the village and the environs of Neftenbach, [...] west-northwest of Winterthur. Nicolas Oudinot, whose men had secured Neftenbach {{as part of the}} French forward line, held out for most of the day, but was forced to retreat [...] to Pfungen in the late afternoon; his position there was not defensible and he was pushed further back to the outskirts of Zürich. By taking Neftenbach, Charles placed a formidable group of troops between Ney's force and Hotze's flank and forced an uneven French withdrawal toward Zürich. Tharreau manoeuvred around the Töss, attempting to re-establish his forward line, but Masséna did not want a general engagement between Zürich and Neftenbach, not <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> then. The Armies of Switzerland and the Danube were not ready to take on Charles; Masséna's forces were not prepared for a battle on the scale required in facing Charles' entire army, and he needed the defences offered by Zürich to mount a proper line against the impending Austrian attack. Eventually, Tharreau withdrew the entire forward line to Zürich. The clash took 11 hours.|$|E
500|$|While Sherwood Smith {{originally}} wrote Crown Duel as {{two separate}} books entitled Crown Duel (1997) and Court Duel (1998), she considered them as [...] "one story." [...] Both novels explore the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, {{the world she}} has been writing about since her youth. Smith grew up wondering why [...] " [...] the way [...] " [...] for instance observing, [...] "Why were the cities so clean, I wondered when I was a kid. I knew about sewers, etc. Why {{is it safe to}} drink from a stream <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> here?". She conceived Sartorias-deles as a world where, {{over the course of several}} centuries, humans of many different races entered through [...] "worldgates" [...] and were influenced by the culture of its indigenous beings. According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, [...] "basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases and wars, tried to fix things for the humans... Their history is not all happy, it's very strange, and humans still have many human problems, but in other ways they are somewhat different from [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Weir became {{involved}} in the discussion of whether the US should boycott the Sochi Olympics because of Russia's anti-gay laws. After publicly expressing his opinion, he received personal threats. He was picketed by Queer Nation outside an appearance at Barnard College in December for his position that “the Olympics are not the place to make a political statement” about Russia’s anti-gay laws and “you have to respect the culture of a country you are visiting.” Weir called the experience [...] "eye-opening," [...] and went on to respond through further media interviews. Subsequently, NBC named Weir and Tara Lipinski to its figure skating coverage team in Sochi. Weir commented, [...] "I’m a gay American...I plan to be there in full support of our brothers and sisters <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> be afraid." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When I {{was growing up in}} Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2016: Hamlin took {{command of}} the field and moved ahead of the No. 2 car. Eventually, Keselowski moved by him coming to the line and took the lead on lap 34. Hamlin shot ahead of Keselowski on the backstretch to take the lead back the next lap. Keselowski used a push from {{teammate}} Joey Logano to retake the lead on lap 37. Just like his first stint in the lead, he picked up another piece of debris that covered his grill. The third caution of the race flew on lap 44 for a single-car spin on the backstretch. Going down the backstretch, Johnson made contact with Mears that sent him spinning through the grass. His car dug into the ground and ripped off the front fender. He said afterwards that he [...] "did a decent job of backing out of <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> causing a big one as the door shut on me." [...] Keselowski opted to stay out {{while the rest of the}} field opted to pit, The race restarted with two laps to go in overtime, The field passed the overtime line and the race was official at that point. After a multi-car wreck in turn 1, Hamlin was declared the race winner.|$|E
