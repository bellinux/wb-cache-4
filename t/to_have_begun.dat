5|$|While all of {{the contradictions}} above cannot be reconciled, the most {{probable}} dates that may be drawn from available data place Æthelberht's birth at approximately 560 and, perhaps, his marriage to Bertha at 580.

5|$|Islam {{was also}} {{well-established}} throughout China, {{with a history}} said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> with Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas during the Tang dynasty and strong official support during the Yuan. Although the Ming sharply curtailed this support, there were still several prominent Muslim figures early on, including the Hongwu Emperor's generals Chang Yuqun, Lan Yu, Ding Dexing, and Mu Ying, {{as well as the}} Yongle Emperor's powerful eunuch Zheng He.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{macroeconomics}} {{can be said}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> with Keynes and {{the publication}} of his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{wanted to}} {{stabilize}} Athens' dominance over its alliance and {{to enforce its}} pre-eminence in Greece. The {{process by which the}} Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> well before Pericles' time, as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles.|$|E

The two were certainly hung together {{for many years in}} Spain when in the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} occupation at La Blanca was {{concentrated in}} the South Group and dates to the Early Classic Period.

Ancient Egyptians (~2400BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching.|$|E
5|$|All Silkies {{have black}} or bluish skin, bones and grayish-black meat; their Chinese {{language}} name is wu gu ji (烏骨雞), meaning 'black-boned chicken'. Melanism which {{extends beyond the}} skin into an animal's connective tissue is a rare trait, and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis, which is a rare mutation believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> in Asia. The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation. Disregarding color, the breed does not generally produce {{as much as the}} more common meat breeds of chicken.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E

5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous, criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s raps of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style is usually said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> in the Los Angeles and Oakland area, where Too Short, NWA and others found their fame. This West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were the breakthrough rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E
5|$|His {{trial for}} {{obstruction}} of justice was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution. The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the {{obstruction of justice}} charge, for giving an evasive {{answer to a question}} under oath. His sentence did not include prison. The conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to overturn the conviction on April 22, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E

5|$|The Potter–Collyer House is a {{historic}} house at 67 Cedar Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The house, first constructed in 1863, is representative of vernacular architecture of the Pawtucket due to the great modifications to the home which has obscured the original structure of the home. Believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> as a -story cottage with a gable roof, subsequent additions and expansions have added a two-story hip-roof addition and greatly altered the floor plan due to enlargement and remodeling.

5|$|Traditionally Luffa is held <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> the {{building}} of Chichester Cathedral, the eastern section of which was dedicated in 1108. However, this view has been challenged by the art historian R. D. H. Gem, who argues {{that because of the}} conservative nature of the architecture it was more probably begun under Luffa's predecessor, Stigand, who was bishop from 1070 to 1087, and who oversaw the transfer of the seat of the bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. Most historians still incline to the belief that Luffa began the cathedral construction, however.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's {{spiritual journey}} is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> at this time. He started to rise early {{to read the}} Bible and pray and kept a private journal. He {{underwent}} an evangelical conversion, regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work {{to the service of}} God. His conversion changed some of his habits, but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, tactfully urging others towards his new faith. Inwardly, he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.|$|E
