5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} <b>that</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses {{the possibility of the}} collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E

5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans {{of the people are}} in the shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from a headache, Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains that she used to live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter <b>that</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did nothing to help Thea's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground. Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground.|$|E

ExxonMobil has a history of lobbying for climate change denial and against the scientific consensus <b>that</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The company has also been the target of accusations of improperly dealing with human rights issues, influence on American foreign policy, and its impact on the future of nations.|$|E

After the 1980s, the company was a leader in climate change denial, opposing regulations to curtail global warming. ExxonMobil funded organizations critical of the Kyoto Protocol and seeking to undermine public opinion about the scientific consensus <b>that</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>is</b> caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Exxon helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition of businesses opposed to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

Republican Congressmen presented two witnesses {{who said that the}} reasons for global warming were unclear. On March 10 the Act advanced out of the subcommittee on a voice vote. On March 15 the Act advanced out of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on a 34 to 19 vote.

In 2007 the Union of Concerned Scientists said that ExxonMobil granted $16million, between 1998 and 2005, towards 43 advocacy organizations which dispute the impact of global warming, and that ExxonMobil used disinformation tactics {{similar to those used}} by the tobacco industry in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking, saying that the company used many of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue.|$|E

It has cut its own operational emissions of CO2 by 10%. It is investing $8 billion in renewable energy over the next 10 years.

Emanuel predicted [...] "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century".|$|E
