25|$|After working {{briefly in}} {{commercial}} aviation, Mantz went to Hollywood, {{attracted by the}} {{large sums of money}} movie stunt pilots were making at the time. A main requirement was Associated Motion Picture Pilots (AMPP) membership but that was only gained after employment in the industry. In an effort to gain notoriety, on July 6, 1930 Mantz set a record in flying 46 consecutive outside loops {{as a part of the}} dedication ceremonies of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> airport.

25|$|Much of {{the area}} that the Mission blue once {{inhabited}} has been destroyed. The coastal sage and chaparral and the native grassland habitats have seen unnatural human development {{in much of the}} region. <b>The</b> <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> County town of Brisbane lies in what may once have been the prime habitat for the butterfly. Near Brisbane, an industrial park and rock quarry have proved damaging to the Mission blue habitat. Generally, the most negative impact is that of residential and industrial development. Aside from development, other human activities have negatively affected the butterfly's habitat. Those activities include cultivation and grazing as well as the oft human assisted abundance of invasive exotic species. Some of the more impactful exotics include the European gorse and pampas grass. In the Golden Gate Recreation Area, thoroughwort is a particular invasive species which is taking over habitat once occupied by the Mission blue's lifeblood, the three species of lupine. Of the threats facing the Mission blue, habitat loss due to human intervention and exotic, invasive species are the two most critical.|$|E
