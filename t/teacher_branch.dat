Learning styles is another accentuated element in point of {{individual differences}}. In this study, the learning styles of the teachers are surveyed by <b>branches.</b> The <b>teachers</b> {{are the most important}} elements in the education. Their role of creating learning environments for students appears with constructivism. The learning styles of the teachers are also important in managing learning process. In this study, learning styles of 223 primary school <b>teachers</b> in different <b>branches</b> in Turkey were determined. Learning styles were defined by Kolb’s learning style inventory and distributed based on branch.

40|$|A vast {{literature}} has investigated {{the efficacy of}} school leadership. Most of the extant research {{has been based on}} teacher perceptions of school leadership, rather than on more direct measures of student performance. 1 A detailed review of the literature on principals through the mid- 1990 s is provided by Hallinger and Heck (1998). Within the last couple of years, however, researchers have begun to exploit longitudinal data on student test scores to evaluate the impact of principals on student achievement and how that impact varies with the characteristics of principals. Beteille, Kalogrides, and Loeb (2009), using data from the Miami-Dade school district, relate principal value-added (measured as school value added during a principal’s tenure) to teacher mobility and changes in teacher productivity. They find that high-value-added principals are better able to retain high-quality teachers and remove relatively low-quality <b>teachers.</b> <b>Branch,</b> Hanushek and Rivkin (2009), using data from Texas, study both the mobility patterns of principals and the effect of principals on student achievement.

Research’s universe includes 662 teachers who worked in the town of Bolu at high schools in education year 2008 - 2009. In the research no sampling was used because scales were distributed to all the teachers in town. 390 of the scales distributed were returned but 86 of them had insufficient data. The research data were extracted with 304 valid scales. In analyzing the data depending on the sub-problems, teachers’ organizational trust perceptions depending on the first sub-problem; percentage, frequency, arithmetic mean, standard deviation were used. In the research t-test was performed to determine whether there was significant difference between the scales depending on the second sub-problem factors like twocategory of gender, status of the union membership, kind of school. One-way analysis of variance (Anova) was used for the data of teachers, who have more than two sub-categories, namely branch, seniority, education status variations and data were analyzed with Tukey-b to determine the source of significant difference between the variations. Research results show high school teachers have a high level of trust in their institutions. It appeared that in the sub–dimension of sensitivity to employees, there is less trust when compared with other dimensions. In communication sub–dimension, trust is at the highest level. With respect to gender variable, women’s organizational trust is higher than men’s. In sensitivity to employees, this difference is more explicit. With respect to variable of branch, there isn’t significant difference in teachers’ views about the dimension of sensitivity to employees. In the dimension of trust to the manager, there is significant difference between social sciences <b>branch</b> <b>teachers</b> and vocational <b>branches</b> <b>teachers.</b> There is significant difference between views of vocational course teachers and numerical and social <b>branch</b> <b>teachers</b> in the dimensions of communication atmosphere and openness to innovation...|$|R
