In addition, writing may take longer and require greater effort on the student's part. Factors linked to handwriting include postural stability, sensory and perceptual abilities of the hand, and writing tool pressure.|$|E

Furthermore, the issues of security have been supplemented with a description of the <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> of the Internal Security Agency, as well as a synthetic appraisal of a terrorist threat to Poland. The main parts of this work are concerned with: (1) the state and the private sphere, (2) " terrorism " and terrorist offences, (3) the <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> of the Internal Security Agency, (4) an appraisal of a terrorist threat to Poland. Given the necessity to elaborate the research problem, the text features the following research questions: (1) To what extent does referring to a threat to security influence a limitation on rights and freedoms in Poland (with regard to the clash between the state and the private sphere) ?, (2) To what extent do the <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> of the Internal Security Agency influence the effectiveness of anti-terrorist security in Poland...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are to analyze the form of activities of entrepreneural spirit implementation in the productive manufacturing practice learning activities at SMK PIKA Semarang. The type of the study was a descriptive qualitative. The informants were the Head of Workshop Education, the productive teachers, and the students. Data collection techniques were observation, interview, and documentation. To validate the data, the study used source triangulation. The data analysis technique was done with the stages of data collection, data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion. The results of the data show that the implementation of entrepreneurial spirit performed well on all six stages of work, although not all of the characters were implemented well in every each stage. At the stage of tools introduction, there are implemention of confidence character, <b>task</b> <b>and</b> result <b>activities</b> oriented, dare to take risk character, and future oriented character. At the stage of work planning, there are implementation of confidence character, <b>task</b> <b>and</b> result <b>activities</b> oriented, dare to take risk character, leadership, future oriented character, and originality character. At the stage of work unit sharping there are implementation of confidence character, <b>task</b> <b>and</b> result <b>activities</b> oriented, dare to take risk character, and leadership character.
