5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{contacted}} Beshear, {{asking for}} an executive order to protect clerks who have moral objections against personally issuing such marriage licenses, as Kentucky law requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses in their names. She began <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> gay couples from her county office who were seeking marriage licenses. David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex couple from Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a marriage license and requesting that they turn off their camera. The video went viral overnight.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{uses the}} {{combined}} image {{of fire and}} Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation. According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising {{the lessons of the}} past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation.|$|E

5|$|Having first {{inhabited}} Pennsylvania between 16,000 and 10,000 BCE, nomadic Native Americans {{reached the}} {{area near the}} mouth of Fishing Creek by 8000 BCE. By 3000 to 2000 BCE, some of them were going into the Fishing Creek valley during the winter to hunt deer and bears and returning to the Susquehanna River in the summer, creating trade routes. There was no permanent habitation until 1000 BCE when some Native American villages were built at the mouth of Fishing Creek. The Native Americans who settled in this area included the Shawnee and Susquehannock Indians. A Native American path ran along the creek from Bloomsburg to Orangeville before <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> in the direction of Tunkhannock Creek. Since at least 1769, there has also been a path between the mouths of Huntington and Green Creeks.|$|E
5|$|J. B. Haggin, an American breeder {{and owner}} of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, {{including}} the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began {{to limit the number}} of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse, <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> a number of American breeders. The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. <b>Turning</b> <b>away</b> from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E

5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain {{of the identity}} of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{hurricane}} that ultimately struck Mexico as a tropical depression in October 2006. It developed {{from an area}} of disturbed weather on October21, and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear. Paul attained hurricane status on October23, and later that day it reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. A strong trough turned the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast into an area of strong vertical shear, and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on October24. It accelerated northeastward, and after passing a short distance south of Baja California Sur the low level circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of the}} convection. Paul weakened to a tropical depression on October25 a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and after briefly <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from the coast it made landfall on northwestern Sinaloa on October26.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sarah and Casey {{learn that}} Ned is {{unmarried}} and had earlier called Mauser {{rather than his}} wife, as the hostages were led to believe. They follow the ambulance containing Chuck and Mauser and shoot its tires, sending the vehicle into a Christmas tree lot and allowing Chuck to escape. After a brief fight, Mauser surrenders, confident that Fulcrum will rescue him. To protect Chuck, Sarah executes Mauser. Unknown to Sarah, Chuck watches the entire confrontation in horror from afar. She lies to Chuck and tells him that Mauser has been arrested. At the Buy More, Ellie and Morgan's girlfriend Anna Wu (Julia Ling) praise Lester for his act of bravery. Morgan watches as Lester grabs Anna and kisses her, <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> before Anna pulls away from Lester in disgust. The episode closes with both Morgan and Chuck heartbroken, Morgan believing Anna to be unfaithful, and Chuck believing Sarah to be a murderer.|$|E

5|$|Shepard pursues Saren {{through the}} Conduit, {{arriving}} at the Citadel as it comes under attack by Sovereign and geth forces. Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while Sovereign is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity will then join the Council, either as a member if it was saved or as its new leader if {{it was left to}} perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from the proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E
5|$|The {{developments}} {{spread to}} Anglo-Norman possessions in Ireland where this English style of castles dominated throughout the 13th century, although the deteriorating Irish {{economy of the}} 14th century brought this wave of building to an end. In Scotland Alexander II and Alexander III undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style, although Alexander III's early death sparked conflict in Scotland and English intervention under Edward I in 1296. In the ensuing wars of Scottish Independence castle building in Scotland altered path, <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from building larger, more conventional castles with curtain walls. The Scots instead adopted the policy of slighting, or deliberately destroying, castles captured in Scotland from the English to prevent their re-use in subsequent invasions – {{most of the new}} Scottish castles built by nobles were of the tower house design; the few larger castles built in Scotland were typically royal castles, built by the Scottish kings.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{launched}} a counterattack, Miller taking the lead. He hoisted off spinner Laker's first ball over the square leg fence for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as his younger partner was struggling against the off breaks that were <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from him, {{including one that}} spun and bounced sharply to beating the outside edge. Miller drilled one off-drive off Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next, much to the amusement of the crowd, hit the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined the fightback in the next over, hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He struck another boundary to reach 44, while Miller's score stayed on 42. After {{half an hour of}} play, the early morning life in the pitch appeared to have died out.|$|E

5|$|With the {{cessation}} of official missions to China and a general trend of <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> from Chinese-derived institutions and behavioral patterns {{in the latter part}} of the 9th century, the compilation of such national histories patterned on formal Chinese dynastic histories was abandoned. With the development of kana script, new styles of uniquely Japanese literature such as the monogatari appeared around that time. The newer style of historic writing that emerged during the Fujiwara regency, at the turning point of ancient imperial rule and the classical era, was called historic tale (rekishi monogatari) and became influenced by the fictional tale, especially by the Tale of Genji, with which it shared the scene-by-scene construction as fundamental difference to earlier historic writings. The oldest historical tale is the Eiga Monogatari ("A Tale of Flowering Fortunes"), giving a eulogistic chronological account of the Fujiwara from 946 to 1027, focusing particularly on Fujiwara no Michinaga. It was largely written by Akazome Emon, probably shortly after the death of Michinaga in 1027.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez {{had planned}} to {{resupply}} his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. <b>Turning</b> <b>away</b> from the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel {{had no choice but to}} surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold, captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons of}} security, Sturmabteilung Koch was {{dispersed}} around several {{locations in the}} Rhineland until it received orders for the operation against Fort Eben-Emael and the three bridges to begin. Preliminary orders were received on 9 May, ordering the separated detachments {{to move to a}} pre-arranged concentration area, and shortly afterwards a second order arrived, informing the assault force that Fall Gelb was to begin at 05:25 on 10 May. At 04:30, forty-two gliders carrying the 493 airborne troops that formed the assault force were lifted off from two airfields in Cologne, the armada of gliders and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives. The aircraft maintained strict radio silence, forcing the pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards Belgium; the radio silence also ensured that senior commanders of the assault force could not be informed that the tow-ropes on one of the gliders had snapped, forcing the glider to land inside Germany. The pilot of a second glider released his tow-rope prematurely, and was unable to land near its objective. Both gliders were carrying troops assigned to Group Granite and were destined to assault Fort Eben-Emael, thereby leaving the group understrength; it also left it under the command of Oberleutnant Witzig's second-in-command, as Witzig was in one of the gliders forced to land. The remaining gliders were released from their tow-ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of , which was deemed high enough for the gliders to land by the three bridges and on top of the fort, and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly. After the Ju-52's released the gliders and began <b>turning</b> <b>away,</b> Belgian anti-aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire. This alerted the defences in the area to the presence of the gliders.|$|E
