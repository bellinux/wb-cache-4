40|$|With {{their many}} benefits, Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) have grown rapidly in their usage in recent years. However, a unfortunate {{side effect of}} their usage is the {{introduction}} of harmonic distortion in the power system and reduction of <b>true</b> <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> (TPF). Low <b>true</b> <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> means poor electrical efficiency. The lower the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> <b>factor,</b> the higher the apparent power drawn from the distribution network. A filter connected at the input side of a VSD converter reduces energy losses in the power supply system by reducing harmonics and improving the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> In this thesis, a typical three-phase rectifier is used as an example to present a methodology of designing such filters in technical and economic terms. The relationship between the cost of input filters and the energy cost reduction they provide on the power supply side of VSDs is discussed. By extending the same method to different loads, filters are designed and power savings are calculated. The pricing of relevant harmonic filters is also discussed. The basics of harmonics and the power factor are presented in the introduction. The summary of the results and suggestions for further research are contained in the last sections of the thesis...|$|E

40|$|Measuring precise power {{used by a}} load of an {{induction}} motor driven by a VFD implies a few facts {{that need to be}} considered. First, the real electric power. When dealing with waveforms of electric current that contain harmonics, traditional methods of power measuring could lead to inaccurate results. Therefore, further investigation needs to be performed in order to provide meaningful values. Then there is the efficiency.

40|$|Retrospective or {{post hoc}} power {{analysis}} is recommended by reviewers and edi-tors of many journals. Little literature {{has been found}} that gave a serious study of the post hoc power. When the sample size is large, the observed effect size is a good estimator of the true effect size. One would hope that the post hoc power is also a good estimator of the <b>true</b> <b>power.</b> This article studies whether such a power estimator provides valuable information about the <b>true</b> <b>power.</b> Using analytical, numerical, and Monte Carlo approaches, our results show that the estimated power does not provide useful information when the <b>true</b> <b>power</b> is small.

40|$|As power {{electronic}} based controllers and loads become {{more prevalent in}} power systems, {{there is a growing}} concern about how the harmonics generated by these controllers and loads affect the power quality of the system. One widely used {{power electronic}} based load is the Variable Frequency Drive (VFDs) used to vary the speed of an induction motor; whereas a common example of a power electronic based controller used in power systems is the Static VAR Compensator (SVC) for improving a system’s power factor. In this thesis, the harmonic content and overall performance of a system including both a VFD and a SVC will be studied and analyzed. Specifically, the cases of no compensation, static capacitor compensation, and power electronic based static VAR compensation are examined. A small-scale model of a system for study was constructed in lab.

40|$|M. Ing. With the {{increased}} use of nonlinear loads such as variable speed motor drives and rectifiers, the voltages and currents on the power system grid are no longer sinusoidal. These non-sinusoidal waveforms cannot be analyzed by conventional power theories and the usual recourse is to decompose the nonlinear waveform into a set of harmonics. Harmonic voltage and current components are detrimental to the power system and may cause additional losses, or premature failure of equipment, and as such they have a definite influence on the quality of supply. This thesis shows the limitations and potential pitfalls of harmonic decomposition and other power theories, and examines various methods used for identifying, quantifying and modelling nonlinear loads. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate methods for attaching a specific disturbance or non-linearity on the voltage waveform to a specific load connected at the point of common coupling. The power theories examined include the total complex power, the IEEE working group definitions of apparent power, <b>true</b> <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> and harmonic adjusted power factor.
