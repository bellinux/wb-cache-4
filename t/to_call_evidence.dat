60|$|On the {{appointed}} day and hour, {{speaking in a}} very crowded court, counsel for the Crown opened the case against me, demonstrating clearly that {{in the pursuit of}} my own miserable ends I had sacrificed the life of a young, high-placed and lovely fellow-creature, and brought bereavement and desolation upon her husband and family. Then he proceeded <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>evidence,</b> which was practically the same as that which had been given before the magistrates, although the husband and Lady Colford's nurse were examined, and, on my behalf, cross-examined at far greater length.|$|E
5000|$|If defence is not {{challenging}} {{the accuracy of}} the results, they only need <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>evidence</b> on the last criteria, and have the expert give evidence why it would not be inconsistent with the breath sample readings. (This is typically called the bolus drinking scenario.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Murphy {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>evidence</b> from {{a professor}} of sociology to support the claim that persons over 18 were considered mature persons in Australia. However, Chief Justice Barwick said that the court would only consider that evidence if they found that the meaning of [...] "adult person" [...] in section 41 was uncertain.|$|E

50|$|To {{work out}} the person's BAC {{at the time of}} giving the breath samples, the {{prosecutor}} can rely on a Certificate of a Qualified Technician, which states what the results were of the analysis of the breath samples, and is evidence of its contents. This is commonly referred to as the presumption of accuracy. It is still open for the defence <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>evidence</b> showing why the results are not accurate, leaving it for the court to weigh the evidence.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, the Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) {{alleged that}} Ryckman had {{conducted}} 88 illegal wash trades over a six-month {{period in the}} stock of Westgroup Corporations in 1994. The ASC held a quasi-judicial hearing at their offices and banned Ryckman from trading in Alberta for 18 years and assessed costs of approximately $375,000. The trading ban was adopted through reciprocity by Ontario and British Columbia. Ryckman denied the allegations and at the hearing asked <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>evidence</b> in his defense and that the matter be heard in a civil court, {{both of which were}} denied.|$|E
40|$|Lawyers {{participating}} in legal malpractice litigation sometimes encounter evidence of serious disciplinary rule violations. Whether, and how soon, those lawyers {{are required to}} report this information to grievance authorities {{is a question that}} has received little attention from courts and scholars, despite the fact that most states have mandatory reporting rules. The dilemma for lawyers serving as testifying experts is particularly troublesome because nonreporting may result not only in discipline, but testimonial impeachment. The better view is that an expert in a pending case ordinarily has no mandatory obligation to report misconduct. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of the narrowness of the reporting obligation, the exceptions to the rule, public policy considerations related to malpractice litigation and grievance procedures, and customary professional practices. However, after litigation ends, an expert (and other lawyers) may have a duty <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>evidence</b> of serious misconduct to the attention of disciplinary authorities...|$|E

2500|$|Much {{has been}} made out of Sonnet 124's ending couplet. In The Sonnets of Shakespeare, edited by Raymond Alden one critic {{describes}} them as, [...] "hopelessly obscure". The couplet <b>calls</b> forth the <b>evidence</b> the speaker has for his claim. As noted by Eugene Wright, the words used in the couplet, [...] "I witness call", [...] "die", [...] "crime" [...] use trial imagery <b>to</b> <b>call</b> forth <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support the sonnet's argument. Those <b>called</b> <b>to</b> [...] "witness" [...] in this trail scene are the [...] "fools of Time"- a phrase that has been dissected by numerous critics.|$|R
50|$|The court {{noted that}} it would cause an accused person great concern to hear a {{magistrate}} questioning {{whether or not it}} was appropriate for the State <b>to</b> <b>call</b> no further <b>evidence.</b> He might understandably believe that the court wanted him or her to be convicted.|$|R
50|$|The court's {{authority}} {{is limited to}} these specific instances; it may not call for viva voce evidence of other issues. The court may exercise the power <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for oral <b>evidence</b> only in exceptional circumstances, having regard to the nature and purpose of the provisional-sentence proceeding.|$|R
25|$|When Straffen's {{murder trial}} opened on 21 July, he pleaded not guilty, and the defence opted {{to leave the}} {{question}} of his sanity as an issue {{to be determined by}} the jury. After the prosecution case (led by the Solicitor-General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller) had opened and called the first witnesses to establish the facts about the murder of Linda Bowyer, they applied <b>to</b> <b>call</b> additional <b>evidence</b> about the two murders in Bath. This application was resisted by Straffen's defence as prejudicial, but the judge ruled the evidence admissible.|$|R

50|$|Sally is <b>called</b> <b>to</b> give <b>evidence</b> but Luke's lawyer, Oliver West, discredits her by {{bringing}} up her alcoholism, her treatment by {{a psychiatrist and}} her attraction to Luke.

50|$|IX. That in all prosecutions for {{criminal}} offenses, a man hath {{a right to}} be heard by himself and his council, to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses, <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for <b>evidence</b> in his favour, and a speedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous consent of which jury he cannot be found guilty; nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself; nor can any man be justly deprived of his liberty except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{plaintiff}} listed several specialist doctors including Prof. Lamabadusuriya as witnesses, only Dr. Srilal Dias was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> give <b>evidence.</b> It was alleged by his counsel that {{doctors in the}} country were reluctant to testify against the defendant in view of her esteemed standing in the medical profession.|$|R
5|$|From {{the first}} article, {{cataloguing}} {{the rights of}} man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear {{that the role of}} government is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the {{people have a right to}} amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for <b>evidence</b> and witnesses in his favor.|$|R

40|$|A key {{function}} of Parliaments in the Westminster {{system is that}} of conducting inquiries into public affairs, including the administration of government.

50|$|R v Stinchcombe, 1991 3 S.C.R. 326 is a {{landmark}} Supreme Court of Canada {{decision on the}} disclosure of evidence in a trial and is considered by most {{to be one of}} the most significant criminal law cases of the decade. The Court found that the Crown had a duty to provide the defence with all evidence that could possibly be relevant to the case, regardless of whether the Crown plans <b>to</b> <b>call</b> that <b>evidence</b> at trial or not, or whether it helps or hurts the Crown's case. This case put to rest the long-standing issue of whether the Crown could purposely deny the defence evidence that the Crown found would be harmful to their case.|$|R
50|$|Swepstone farmers {{regularly}} {{sold their}} cattle in local market towns. In 1597 three Swepstone farmers, Richard Dudley, William Chilwell and Thomas Burrows were <b>called</b> <b>to</b> give <b>evidence</b> in an archdeaconry court case.
