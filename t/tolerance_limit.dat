40|$|SummaryBackgroundRadiotherapy {{simulators}} play {{an important}} role in the preparation of radiation treatment. Their mechanical and geometrical parameters have to be identical with those of the treatment machines. Therefore, quality control protocols for the simulators should be comprehensive and the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> as high as those for treatment machines. AimEvaluation of the technical status of radiotherapy simulators involved in clinical trials. Materials/MethodsIn this paper, results of quality control tests conducted in 12 Polish radiotherapy centres are presented. The tests were carried out within the framework of Polish research project KBN No. 6 P 05 C 032 20. 12 radiotherapy simulators installed in Polish radiotherapy centres were thoroughly tested. In order to control technical conditions of the simulators, a set of 24 tests was elaborated. The tests were divided into six thematic groups. The detailed range of the parameters controlled and the accepted ranges of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are given. The values of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are based on data found in the available literature. ResultsThe control of 12 simulators revealed the violation of accepted <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> for 13 out of 24 controlled parameters. The most frequent violations of accepted <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> occurred in the case of geometrical parameters of light simulation and mechanical parameters of the couch, both very important for the accuracy of the simulation process. For 2 simulators almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b> ConclusionsThe control of radiotherapy simulators undertaken within the framework of the clinical trial revealed that in the majority of cases the simulators were in good technical condition. In 2 cases almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b> In such cases the manufacturers' service should be called urgently for necessary repairs and regulations. After repeated quality control tests a decision should be taken regarding the accepted range of operations which could be used in clinical practice. A QA and QC system for radiotherapy simulators should be introduced in each radiotherapy centre...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} Taguchi's quality loss {{function}} was {{in contrast with}} the American concept of quality, popularly known as goal post philosophy, the concept given by American quality guru Phil Crosby. Goal post philosophy emphasizes that if a product feature doesn't meet the designed specifications it is termed as a product of poor quality (rejected), irrespective of amount of deviation from the target value (mean value of tolerance zone). This concept has similarity with the concept of scoring a 'goal' in the game of football or hockey, because a goal is counted 'one' irrespective of the location of strike of the ball in the 'goal post', whether it is in the center or towards the corner. This means that if the product dimension goes out of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> the quality of the product drops suddenly.|$|E

To determine these <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits,</b> we extracted maximum and minimum values of all environmental variables in corresponding locations where coral reefs are present.

The averaged minimum light intensity in coral reefs is 450 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1. The global area of potential reef habitats calculated by the model is 330. 5 × 103 km 2.

Cryopreservation is a potential long-term storage strategy for maintaining the quality of cord RBCs for the use in intrauterine and neonatal transfusion. However, during cryopreservation, cells are subjected to damaging osmotic stresses during cryoprotectant addition and removal and freezing and thawing that require knowledge of osmotic <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> in order to optimize the preservation process. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the osmotic <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> of cord RBCs in conditions relevant to cryopreservation, and compare the results to the osmotic <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> of adult RBCs. Osmotic <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> were determined by exposing RBCs to solutions of different concentrations to induce a range of osmotic volume changes. Three treatment groups of adult and cord RBCs were tested: 1) isotonic saline, 2) 40 % w/v glycerol, and 3) frozen-thawed RBCs in 40 % w/v glycerol. We show that cord RBCs are more sensitive to shrinkage and swelling than adult RBCs, indicating that osmotic <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> should be considered when adding and removing cryoprotectants. In addition, freezing and thawing resulted in both cord and adult RBCs becoming more sensitive to post-thaw swelling requiring that glycerol removal procedures for both cell types ensure that cell volume excursions are maintained below 1. 7 times the isotonic osmotically active volume to attain good post-wash cell recovery.
