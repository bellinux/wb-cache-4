5000|$|More than 20 oxidatively damaged DNA base lesions were {{identified}} in 2003 by Cooke et al. and these overlap the 12 oxidized bases reported in 1992 by Dizdaroglu. [...] Two {{of the most frequently}} oxidized bases found by Dizdaroglu after ionizing radiation (causing oxidative stress) were the two oxidation products of guanine shown in the Figure. One of these products was 8-OH-Gua (8-hydroxyguanine). (The article 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine refers to the same damaged base since the keto form 8-oxo-Gua described there may undergo a <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shift</b> to the enol form 8-OH-Gua shown here.) The other product was FapyGua (2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine). Another frequent oxidation product was 5-OH-Hyd (5-hydroxyhydantoin) derived from cytosine.|$|E
30|$|Sugars {{present in}} plant extract can also induce the {{synthesis}} of metal nanoparticles. It is reported that glucose which is a monosaccharide can act as reducing agent. Other monosaccharides such as fructose, which contain a keto group, may act as antioxidants by undergoing a series of tautomeric transformations from a ketone to an aldehyde. Reducing capability of disaccharides and polysaccharides depends upon their individual monosaccharide components, to form an open chain from within an oligomer and hence {{to provide access to}} an aldehyde group. Sucrose in contrast has no ability to reduce metal ions due to glucose and fructose monomers are linked in the form of open chain which is not available. Glucose is known as a strong reducing agent as compared to fructose, because the antioxidant activity of fructose is limited by the kinetics of <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shift</b> [74].|$|E

The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil.|$|R
50|$|A {{sugar is}} {{classified}} as a reducing sugar only if it has an open-chain form with an aldehyde group or a free hemiacetal group. Monosaccharides which contain an aldehyde group are known as aldoses, and those with a ketone group are known as ketoses. The aldehyde can be oxidized via a redox reaction in which another compound is reduced. Thus, a reducing sugar is one that reduces certain chemicals. Sugars with ketone groups in their open chain form are capable of isomerizing via a series of <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shifts</b> to produce an aldehyde group in solution. Therefore, ketone-bearing sugars like fructose are considered reducing sugars {{but it is the}} isomer containing an aldehyde group which is reducing since ketones cannot be oxidized without decomposition of the sugar. This type of isomerization is catalyzed by the base present in solutions which test for the presence of aldehydes. Aldoses or aldehyde-bearing sugars are reducing also because during oxidation of aldoses, there are certain oxidizing agents that are reduced.|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} crystal {{structure}} of the DNA hexamer duplex d(CGCGCA). d(TGCGCG) at 1. 71 Å resolution. The crystals, in orthorhombic space group, were grown {{in the presence of}} cobalt hexammine, a known inducer of the left-handed Z form of DNA. The interaction of this ion with the DNA helix results in a change of the adenine base from the common amino tautomeric form to the imino tautomer. Consequently the A:T base pair is disrupted from the normal Watson–Crick base pairing to a ‘wobble’ like base pairing. This change is accommodated easily within the helix, and the helical parameters are those expected for Z-DNA. When the cobalt hexammine concentration is decreased slightly in the crystallization conditions, the duplex crystallizes in a different, hexagonal space group, with two hexamer duplexes in the asymmetric unit. One of these is situated on a crystallographic 6 -fold screw axis, leading to disorder. The <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shift</b> is not observed in this space group. We show that the change in inter-helix interactions that lead to the two different space groups probably arise from the small decrease in ion concentration, and consequently disordered positions for the ion...|$|E
40|$|Formally, the C 47 N 4 exocyclic amine {{could serve}} as a general acid {{catalyst}} according to two models: (1) C 47 acts from the neutral form, generating the nucleobase anion following proton transfer from N 4, or (2) the catalytically active form of C 47 is a cation that is protonated at N 3. N 3 would hence serve as an electron sink, favoring a <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shift</b> to the N 4 -imino form as a proton is transferred from N 4 during catalysis. We consider both of these models unlikely. For Model 1, the neutral form of C (pKa ~ 12) is not sufficiently acidic to serve as an effective general acid. For Model 2, in order to provide general acid catalysis without influencing the pH-rate profile over the range 5. 7 - 8. 5, the ribozyme would have to shift the pKa of the C 47 cation by at least four pKa units (from 4 to> 8). Furthermore, methylation of N 3, which would perturb the pKa for both N 3 and N 4, has a negligible effect on catalysis (S 1), which also suggests that model 2 is not valid.

40|$|Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) plays {{a central}} role in {{cysteine}} metabolism, and malfunction of the enzyme leads to homocystinuria, a devastating metabolic disease. CBS contains a pyridoxal 5 ′- phosphate (PLP) cofactor which catalyzes the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine. Mammalian forms of the enzyme also contain a heme group, which is not involved in catalysis. It may, however, play a regulatory role, since the enzyme is inhibited when CO or NO are bound to the heme. We have investigated the mechanism of this inhibition using fluorescence and resonance Raman spectroscopies. CO binding is found to induce a <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shift</b> of the PLP from the ketoenamine to the enolimine form. The ketoenamine is key to PLP reactivity because its imine C=N bond is protonated, facilitating attack by the nucleophilic substrate, serine. The same tautomer shift is also induced by heat inactivation of Fe(II) CBS, or by an Arg 266 Met replacement in Fe(II) CBS, which likewise inactivates the enzyme; in both cases the endogenous Cys 52 ligand to the heme is replaced by another, unidentified ligand. CO binding also displaces Cys 52 from the heme. We propose that the tautomer shift results from loss of a stabilizing H-bond from Asn 149 to the PLP ring O 4 atom, which is negatively charged in the ketoenamine tautomer. This loss would be induced by displacement of the PLP as a result of breaking the salt bridge between Cys 52 and Arg 266, which resides on a short helix that is also anchored to the PLP via H-bonds to its phosphate group. The salt bridge would be broken when Cys 52 is displaced from the heme. Cys 52 protonation is inferred to be the rate-limiting step in breaking the salt bridge, since the rate of the tautomer shift, following CO binding, increases with decreasing pH. In addition, elevation of the concentration of phosphate buffer was found to diminish the rate and extent of the tautomer shift, suggesting a ketoenamine-stabilizing phosphate binding site, possibly at the protonated imine bond of the PLP. Implications of these findings for CBS regulation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Proton {{changes have}} been {{advanced}} as being the key molecular basis for the mutagenecity of alkylated DNA bases and nucleosides, leading to questions as to which protons are involved and whether the protic changes are <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shifts</b> or abstractions. This semiempirical molecular orbital study seeks to clarify the issue by examining the various possibilities open for these protic changes {{in a number of}} methylated guanines and thymines and their deoxynucleosides. Proton shifts leading to tautomer formation are not predicted as being thermodynamically favourable in most cases. The most feasible proton abstractions are predicted to involve the Watson-Crick protons in all cases, which corroborates Watson-Crick proton loss as providing the key molecular basis for the induction of point mutations. The calculated proton acidities correlate well with experimental data. The gas-phase deprotonation enthalpies for a number of alkylated nucleosides are found to correlate linearly with the solvent-phase pK(a) values. The theoretically calculated enthalpies in a simulated aqueous solvent phase of the deprotonation reactions of various nucleic acid bases are also found to have good linear correlations with experimental pK(a) values. The consensus of these calculations is that O- 6 -alkyldeoxyguanosines, and O- 2 - and O- 4 -alkyldeoxythymidines would be mutagenic while N- 7 -alkyldeoxyguanosines would not be mutagenic (as experiment indicates). The untested N- 3 -methyldeoxyguanosine is predicted to be mutagenic. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{replication of}} DNA requires {{the formation of}} complementary hydrogen bonds between a template base and the base moiety of an incoming deoxynucleotide- 5 ‘-triphosphate. Recent structural studies suggest that some DNA polymerases contribute additional constraints by interrogating the minor groove face of the incoming and template bases. Therefore, the hydrogen bond-donating or -accepting properties of the base pairing as well as minor groove faces of the bases could be important determinants of correct base selection. In this paper, we investigate two purines that could arise by endogenous damage of the normal DNA bases:[*] isoguanine (which can be generated by the oxidation of adenine) and xanthine (which can be generated by the deamination of guanine). In both cases, the potential exists for the placement of a proton in the N 3 position, converting the N 3 position from a hydrogen bond acceptor to a donor. In this paper, we use first principles quantum mechanical methods (density functional theory using the B 3 LYP functional and the 6 - 31 G++G**basis set) to predict the ionization and tautomeric equilibria of both isoguanine and xanthine in the gas phase and aqueous solution. For isoguanine, {{we find that the}} N 1 H and N 3 H neutral tautomeric forms are about equally populated in aqueous solution, while the enol tauotomers are predominant in the gas phase. In contrast, we find that xanthine displays essentially no <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shifts</b> in aqueous solution but is nearly equally populated by both an anionic and a neutral form at physiological pH. To obtain these results, we carried out an extensive examination of the tautomeric and ionic configurations for both xanthine and isoguanine in solution and in the gas phase. The potential hydrogen-bonding characteristics of these damaged purines may be used to test predictions of the important components of base selection by different DNA polymerases during DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the coordination chemistry of l-cyanoguanidine (cnge), l-carbamoylguanidine (clge) and l-amidino-O-ethylurea (aOeu). Various copper(II) complexes of these analogous molecules were synthesised and characterised using mainly X-ray crystallographic and spectroscopic (infrared and UV-visible) techniques. Only bis (cnge) complexes were observed for copper(II) ions. The monodentate cnge ligands coordinated the copper(II) via their nitrile nitrogen atoms which were located in trans equatorial positions of the copper(II) ions's tetragonally distorted octahedral coordination sphere. Comparison of the infrared spectra of the complexes with that of cnge indicated that the spectra were highly diagnostic of coordination to the copper(II) ion. Clge exhibited amphoteric properties; the neutral, anionic and cationic derivatives formed complexes with the copper(II) ion. Whereas the former pair gave bis chelate complexes, the latter derivatives acted merely as a cation and was remote from the copper(II) ion's coordination sphere. Complexation of the neutral molecule resulted in a proton transfer from a terminal amine group to a central nitrogen atom permitting chelation via an imine nitrogen atom and a carbonyl oxygen atom to give a square planar CUN 2 O 2 chromophore. The structural ramifications of this <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shift</b> were near identical to those observed upon cation formation which occurred by protonation of the central nitrogen atom of the uncoordinated neutral molecule. Unequivocal structural data could not be obtained for the complex of the anionic derivative. Spectroscopic analysis indicated, however, that chelation occurred via two imine nitrogen atoms to give a square planar CuN 4 chromophore. Ethanolysis of cnge was effected in the presence of copper(II) ions and ethanol producing complexes of aOeu with a metal:ligand ratio of 1 : 1 or 1 : 2. In both complexes the ligand(s) chelated the copper(II) ion via two imine nitrogen atoms. The former complex, a dimer, exhibited a square pyramidal CUN 2 X 3 chromophore (X=Cl,Br) whilst the latter complex was a bis chelate with a square planar CUN 4 chromophore. Monitoring the Uv-visible and infrared spectra of ethanol solutions containing copper(II) chloride and cnge, indicated the presence of a plethora of reactions. However, it was concluded that initially mono and/or bis(cnge) copper(II) complexes, of low stability, were present in equilibrium with the reactants. Subsequently, ethanolysis of coordinated cnge occurred producing mono(aOeu) copper(II) complexes. Series first order kinetics approximated to those of the ethanolysis reaction. The ethanolysis process was then repeated to give the final product a bis(cnge) copper(II) complex...|$|E
40|$|THE STRUCTUBE OF DIPYRROLES AND INDOLE FORMATION FROM PYRROLES: From the {{examples}} {{cited in the}} historical section it was seen that pyrroles reacted with themselves to form dimeric addition products. [ [...] . ] Pyrroles seldom form salts with acids, and methiodides are practically unknown. Since dipyrroles form salts with one equivalent of acid, {{at least one of}} the nitrogen atoms must be different, hence one of the characteristic pyrrole linkages has disappeared. [ [...] . ] Hydrogen atoms undergo a <b>tautomeric</b> <b>shift</b> is pyrroles, in that the usual reagents give derivatives of either possible form, i. e. HN 02 gives ß-nitroso derivatives only, even with pyrrole itself; and acylating agents usually attack the carbon alpha to the nitrogen atom. The Grignard reagent should show the presence of two active hydrogen atoms, but the use of this reagent as a method for determining structure in pyrrole series is known to be unreliable. [ [...] . ] From {{the examples}} cited, it seems evident that like any substance of the type HA pyrroles should add to the conjugated system of a second reactant. When there is nothing else present for the pyrrole to combine with, it should add to itself for it contains the necessary conjugated system.

40|$|Bis-dehydroxycurcumin tert-butyl ester (K 2 T 23) is a {{derivative}} {{of the natural}} spice curcumin. Curcumin is widely studied for its multiple therapeutic properties, including photosensitized cytotoxicity. However, the full exploitation of curcumin phototoxic potential is hindered by the extreme instability of its excited state, caused by very efficient non radiative decay by means of transfer of the enolic proton to the nearby keto oxygen. K 2 T 23 is designed to exhibit a <b>tautomeric</b> equilibrium <b>shifted</b> toward the diketo conformers with respect to natural curcumin. This property should endow K 2 T 23 with superior excited-state stability when excited in the UVB band, i. e., in correspondence of the diketo conformers absorption peaks, making this compound an interesting candidate for topical photodynamic therapy of, e. g., skin tumors or oral infections. In this work, the tautomeric equilibrium of K 2 T 23 between the keto-enolic and diketo conformers is assessed in the ground state in several organic solvents by UV-visible absorption and by nuclear magnetic resonance. The same tautomeric equilibrium is also probed in the excited-state in the same environments by means of steady-state fluorescence and time-correlated single-photon counting measurements. These techniques are also exploited to elucidate the excited state dynamics and excited-state deactivation pathways of K 2 T 23, which are compared to those determined for several other curcuminoids characterized in previous works of ours.

40|$|Multiple H-bonded base-pairing as a {{fundamental}} element of DNA structure was first described by Watson and Crick using stable keto tautomer forms. In their analysis, they considered the possibility of mutations via <b>tautomeric</b> proton transfer <b>shifts.</b> Among other phenomena, such shifts {{can be caused by}} electronic excitation; for example, anomalous adenine-cytosine pairing may be a result of two-proton phototautomerism. One suitable model base pair for two-proton translocating tautomerization is the C 2 h dimer of 7 -azaindole (7 AI) proposed by Taylor et al. in 1969. The most salient contribu¬tion of their work was that the double proton transfer in such a dimer occurs in a concerted manner. After the strong controversy raised in 1995 by the proposal of Douhal et al. of a stepwise mechanism for the process was overcome, its concerted nature has been strongly supported by available evidence (see references and references therein). Very recently, however, Kwon and Zewail claimed to have obtained new supportive evidence that the proton phototransfer in 7 AI dimer in polar solvents is in fact a stepwise rather than concerted process. In this communication, we conducted a systematic spectroscopic study of the dimerization of 7 AI at a 0. 1 M concentration in acetonitrile that may allow us to demonstrate whether the 0. 1 M 7 AI solutions in acetonitrile at room temperature used by Kwon and Zewail contained enough 7 AI doubly hydrogen bonded dimer to enable its photoselection and hence its photophysical characterization with femtosecond / fluorescence spectroscopy...|$|R
