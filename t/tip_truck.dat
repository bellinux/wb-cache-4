5000|$|A {{dump truck}} (known in the UK as a dumper/tipper truck) is a truck used for {{transporting}} loose material (such as sand, gravel, or demolition waste) for construction. A typical dump truck {{is equipped with}} an open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and equipped with hydraulic pistons to lift the front, allowing the material in the bed to be deposited ("dumped") on the ground behind the truck {{at the site of}} delivery. In the UK, Australia and India the term applies to off-road construction plant only, and the road vehicle is known as a tipper, tipper lorry (UK, India) or <b>tip</b> <b>truck</b> (AU).|$|E
40|$|Recently the {{air craft}} and {{military}} industries widely {{have been using}} aluminium alloys particularly because of their fine strength to weight ratio. However in compare with steels they represent welding difficulties and also lower ductility. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine the effects of friction stir welding (FSW) parameters, which are the tool rotation speed, Welding speed, Too tilt angle. The Micro hardness and mechanical properties of butt joint Aluminum Alloy (Al 5083) sheets of thickness 4 mm. The microstructure examinations and mechanical test results indicated that the joint properties were significantly affected by FSW parameters. Due to high strength, good welding properties, increased wear and corrosion resistance and high strength-to weight ratio, Aluminium 5083 is widely used in Ship building, Rail cars, Vehicle bodies, <b>Tip</b> <b>truck</b> bodies, Pressure vessels. Friction Stir Welding is an emerging solid state joining process in which the material that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non- consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters and tool profile play major roles in deciding the weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the effect to tool rotational speed (rpm), welding speed (mm/min) and Tool tilt angle (degrees) on 5083 Aluminium Alloy Plates of thickness 4 mm. A sound and defect-free weld was achieved with a tool rotation speed of 1100 rpm, weldin...|$|E
5000|$|In 1875 Hudson {{patented}} the [...] "triple centre" [...] side <b>tipping</b> <b>truck.</b> This {{truck is}} of triangular section and has support frames {{at each end}} with three pivot points. The centre pivot being the normal rest position whilst the two outer pivots being used for tipping left or right. This arrangement allows the contents to be easily removed by one man without overturning the truck. Another innovation that Hudson introduced {{was the use of}} hydraulic machinery to form pressed steel components. The use of corrugation as part of the pressing process also helped to provide a strong body with thinner gauge steel. This combination provided a competitive advantage that contributed to Hudson's success.|$|R

500|$|An {{advance party}} of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron from RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, moved to Onslow in August 1951 with heavy {{construction}} equipment, taking {{the train to}} Geraldton and then the road to Onslow. This was then transported to the Monte Bello Islands. A prefabricated hut was taken across by Karangai, along with equipment for establishing a meteorological station. Other materiel was moved from Onslow to the islands in [...] lots in an ALC-40 landing craft manned by the Australian Army and towed by Karangai. This included two 25-ton bulldozers, a grader, <b>tip</b> <b>trucks,</b> portable generators, [...] water tanks and a mobile radio transceiver. The hut was erected, and the meteorological station henceforth manned by an RAAF officer and four assistants. Roads and landings were constructed, and camp sites established.|$|R

50|$|As {{the cops}} order lunch, a call comes {{in over the}} radio about a {{criminal}} on the loose in a red delivery truck. Both cops spy Ronald McDonald (voiced by Stephenson) in the truck and give chase. The pursuit quickly veers out of control, as innocent bystanders are imperiled. Meanwhile, the kids at the zoo have finished their visit and are back on the school bus, soon nearing the Pizza Hut where Esso Girl is waiting on the Original Pringles mascot and the Pringles Hot & Spicy mascot.

50|$|These were an {{extension}} of the quarries at Woolsthorpe and Harston. Quarrying began east of the road from Knipton to Croxton Kerrial in 1924, ceasing in 1943. A quarry {{on the west side of}} the road operated in 1941-46. The quarries used steam and diesel quarrying machines. Ore was removed by a steam-operated narrow-gauge tramway to a tipping dock on the standard-gauge railway at Harston, where it was <b>tipped</b> into standard-gauge <b>trucks</b> for transport. In 1956 quarrying resumed where it had finished in 1946. By that time the narrow-gauge tramway had been replaced by a standard-gauge one worked by steam engines, which brought the trucks to the sidings at Harston from where British Railways locomotives took them away. From 1960 onwards the ore from some of the quarries was loaded into lorries for taking either to the tramway or the sidings at Harston. The tramway was lifted in early 1964, but the lorry-worked quarries continued for a while. Production at Knipton had ceased by the end of 1964.|$|R
