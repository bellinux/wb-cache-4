Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are more typically {{cited as the}} fathers of contemporary social science. In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism.

5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage <b>the</b> <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{assumption}} of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation: independence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian. The timeline {{of events and}} why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague. In {{the second half of}} 271, Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans; this may have alarmed the queen, driving her to claim the imperial title. Zenobia also probably understood <b>the</b> <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning subordination would be useless; her {{assumption of}} the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause. Aurelian's campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.|$|E

5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite <b>the</b> <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of working}} with the middle-class Liberal Party to achieve working-class {{representation}} in parliament was not universally accepted, however. Marxist socialists, believing in <b>the</b> <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> class struggle between the working-class and the capitalist class, rejected the idea of workers making common cause with the petty bourgeois Liberals in exchange for scraps of charity from the legislative table.

40|$|This {{essay is}} an {{exploration}} into <b>the</b> social <b>inevitabilities</b> <b>of</b> culture shifts within the American Muslim community’s self-understanding of their faith. Rather than a theological explication {{of the reasons}} why and why not Islam may or can or will not assimilate in America, our approach will be strictly sociological thereby side-stepping the intricate dialectic of theological niceties in deference to the social realities of culture change. As a social psychologist, my duty is to acknowledge <b>the</b> <b>inevitabilities</b> <b>of</b> behavioral shifts brought about due to social and cultural pressures resulting from immigration into an alien cultural weltanschauung, i. e., worldview. Therefore in this essay, we will explicate the meaning and nature of de-ethnicization and re-enculturation as we endeavor to disentangle religion from culture, recognizing that much of what goes under the flag of religious orthodoxy is really culturally-mandated behavior and worldview. The assimilation process, however, will bear heavily upon the necessity for Muslim clergy in America to become professional by Western standards and we will in the process explore the complexities of religious secularism as a way of becoming an “American” Muslim. Finally, we will suggest liturgical and architectural “adjustments” to Western modes of public worship while indicating linguistic niceties which will prove helpful in the assimilation process which we have chosen here to call the “Islamicization of America”...|$|R
