It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand.

2500|$|Germ line cells {{develop into}} eggs and sperm and the {{associated}} inherited material can be passed down to future generations. As shown in the associated karyotype image, chromosomes 1–22 are grouped A-G. A population of male grasshoppers (Chorthippus binotatus) from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) are polysomic mosaics (coming from cells of two genetically different types) possessing an extra E group chromosome(chromosomes 16, 17 & 18) in their testicles. [...] Parents that exhibited polysomy did not pass the E chromosome abnormality {{to any of the}} offspring, so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is passed down to future generations. Male grasshoppers (Atractomorpha similis) from Australia carry between one and ten extra copies of chromosome A9, with one being the most common in natural populations. Most polysomic males produce normal sperm. However, polysomy can be transmissible through both the male and female parents through nondisjunction.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2008, George Friedman, US {{military}} analyst, and a CEO of a US-based think-tank Stratfor, {{wrote in}} the institution's report: [...] "There had {{been a great deal}} of shelling by the South Ossetians of Georgian villages for the previous three nights, but while possibly more intense than usual, artillery exchanges were routine. [...] It is very difficult to imagine that the Georgians launched their attack against U.S. wishes. The Georgians rely on the United States, and they were in no position to defy it. [...] the United States either was unaware of the existence of Russian forces, or knew of the Russian forces but -- along with the Georgians -- miscalculated Russia's intentions. [...] Putin did not want to re-establish the Soviet Union, but he did want to re-establish the Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union region. [...] He did not want to confront NATO directly, but he did want to confront and defeat a power that was closely aligned with the United States, had U.S. support, aid and advisers and was widely seen as being under American protection. Georgia was the perfect choice. [...] The war in Georgia, therefore, is Russia's public return to great power status. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> just happened — it has been unfolding ever since Putin took power, and with growing intensity in the past five years." ...|$|E

She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there.
