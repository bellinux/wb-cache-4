5|$|By April 1975, morale in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{had sunk}} {{so low that}} some of their {{personnel}} simply defected to the Communist side. In a well-known incident, South Vietnamese pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung used his F-5E fighter-bomber to attack <b>the</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>Palace</b> in Saigon instead of North Vietnamese troops. Shortly afterwards, Trung joined the Communist forces and he was ordered to train a group of North Vietnamese pilots to operate the U.S.-made A-37 Dragonfly fighter-bomber, in order to support the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. On the afternoon of April 28, 1975, Trung led a flight of five A-37 fighter-bombers against Tan Son Nhut Air Base, which temporarily stopped U.S. and South Vietnamese evacuation efforts.|$|E
5|$|Darah dan Doa was {{released}} in 1950 and distributed by Spectra Film Exchange. It was given the English title The Long March, which the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests is {{a reference to the}} Chinese Long March of 1934. Not long after the film's release, a two-pronged controversy grew around it, which resulted in the film being banned in parts of the country. Members of other military divisions considered the film to put too much emphasis on Siliwangi's role, while members of the general public had difficulty believing that Darul Islam could have betrayed the national cause. Ultimately the film required President Sukarno's permission to be re-released in September 1950, after he received a private screening at <b>the</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>Palace</b> in mid-1950. However, several scenes had to be cut.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1934, Wu {{studied at}} the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University and {{reinstated}} in Taiwan), first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at <b>the</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>Palace</b> in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E

5|$|In March 2008, Kirchner {{introduced}} a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, so that rates fluctuated with international prices. This would effectively raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister Martín Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>palace.</b> These demonstrations were followed by others at locations across the country that included road blockades and food shortages.|$|E
5|$|The coup was {{organised}} {{with the}} help of some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The marine battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Lieu. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00. However, the airborne soldiers were not aware of what their officers had in store. They were told that they were heading into the countryside to attack the Viet Cong. Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the Presidential Guard, who were meant to guard <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>palace,</b> had mutinied against Diệm.|$|E
5|$|The {{crews of}} the torpedo boats {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government, and army troops moved to <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>palace</b> and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the National Congress of Brazil {{to give in to}} the rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstream}} media depicted Diệm as a friendly and charismatic leader who related {{well to the}} populace. The Herald showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens. Diệm was depicted making friends with a young boy from a Collingwood public housing estate and having tea with South Vietnamese students studying abroad at the University of Melbourne, with the females wearing the traditional ao dai. In contrast, Diệm was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>palace</b> to mingle with his people, and holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} rationale {{given by}} the military was that their actions had prevented an imminent Bolshevik coup, allegedly scheduled for 20 December. Martial law was declared. About 350 communists were arrested and four leaders (Karolis Požela, Juozas Greifenbergeris, Kazys Giedrys and Rapolas Čarnas) were executed on 29 December. This was a serious blow to the Communist Party of Lithuania and it was inactive for a time. No concrete evidence was ever found that the communists had planned any coups. Other political parties and organizations were not brutalized and, according to the military, no casualties {{were associated with the}} coup, apart from the four executions. However, other sources cite the case of Captain Vincas Jonuška, who was allegedly shot by the guards of <b>the</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>Palace,</b> and died a day later in a hospital.|$|E
