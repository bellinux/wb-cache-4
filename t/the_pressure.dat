5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is <b>the</b> <b>pressure,</b> showing the last two integer digits of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> at a certain {{location}} is 999.7hPa, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> is left off, other nearby stations give away whether <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> is replaced with the height of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> surface.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid is placed on <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume.

Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E

5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the airways is higher than <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
