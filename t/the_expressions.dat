The aim of {{the present}} study was to quantitatively analyze <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -A and PDGF-B in the {{vascular}} walls of patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease (LEAOD). <b>The</b> <b>expression</b> levels of PDGF-A and PDGF-B in the lower extremity arteries of 19 LEAOD patients (case group) and three healthy subjects (control group) was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Intergroup compari-sons revealed that <b>the</b> relative mRNA <b>expression</b> levels were higher in the case group, as compared with the control group, for PDGF-A (34. 38 ± 5. 80 vs. 21. 94 ± 1. 05; P< 0. 05) and PDGF-B (33. 95 ± 5. 92 vs. 24. 15 ± 3. 12; P< 0. 05). In addition, the expres-sion of PDGF-A revealed a positive linear correlation with <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> of PDGF-B (P< 0. 05). Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> levels of PDGF-A and PDGF-B were found to be higher in the vascular walls of LEAOD patients, while <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> of PDGF-A was found to correlate with <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> of PDGF-B.
