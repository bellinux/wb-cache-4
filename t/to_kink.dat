Stabilized pinch machines added a set of external magnets that created a toroidal magnetic field inside the chamber.

50|$|The herons are medium- to large-sized {{birds with}} long legs and necks. They exhibit very little sexual {{dimorphism}} in size. The smallest species is usually considered the little bittern, which can measure under 30 cm in length, although all the {{species in the}} Ixobrychus genus are small and many broadly overlap in size. The largest species of heron is the goliath heron, which stands up to 152 cm tall. The necks are able <b>to</b> <b>kink</b> in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the cervical vertebrae, of which they have 20-21. The neck is able to retract and extend, and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The neck is longer in the day herons than the night herons and bitterns. The legs are long and strong and in almost every species are unfeathered from {{the lower part of}} the tibia (the exception is the zigzag heron). In flight, the legs and feet are held backward.

50|$|Tiger {{tail wire}} (also simply called tiger tail or tiger-tail) {{is a kind}} of thin wire encased in nylon often used in beaded jewellery, and that is {{particularly}} suited to stringing heavy beads and sharp beads, which tend to fray other kinds of thread. For this reason, tiger tail is the thread of choice for gemstones. Some tiger tail has multiple intertwined wire threads under the nylon coating. The wire threads are made of stainless steel. Tiger tail cannot be fashioned into a knot in order to end a sequence of beads as other kinds of thread can, therefore crimp beads are often used for this purpose instead. Crimp beads are also used as spacers between other beads strung on tiger tail. Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail is the most common. Tiger tail is easier to use than many other kinds of thread, and it does not require the use of a sewing needle. Tiger tail has high ultimate tensile strength and is therefore extremely difficult to tear, but if it is creased or twisted, tiger tail has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>kink</b> and then become brittle in the kinked area.|$|E

"62 KGW", as {{it called}} itself during its later years under those call letters, {{was one of}} the most popular radio {{stations}} in Portland in the 1960s and 1970s, but its ratings declined during the 1980s, despite a shift to adult contemporary music and on July 28, 1989, the station changed to a talk format, using primarily local hosts. The change did not produce the hoped-for ratings turnaround, and on July 26, 1991, the talk programming was replaced by a simulcast of sister station KINK-FM's programming, but retaining the longstanding and locally well-known call sign, KGW, until March 1, 1993, when the call letters were changed <b>to</b> <b>KINK.</b> On February 6, 1995, KINK-AM changed back to all-talk, now airing nationally syndicated talk radio programming instead of local talk, and the call letters changed to KOTK.

5000|$|Huntsham Castle, Devon, England is an Iron Age Hill fort {{enclosure}} {{near the}} village of Huntsham, it is located 260 m above sea level {{on the edge of the}} former Parish of Tiverton. The monument includes a slight univallate hillfort situated on a prominent hill overlooking the valleys of two separate tributaries to the River Lowman. The monument survives as a sub-circular enclosure, defining an area which slopes gently down to the south and measures approximately 150m in diameter. It is clearly demarcated on all sides by a rampart which varies in height from 1m up to 2.4m internally, being generally of greater height on the northern side of the enclosure. Externally this rampart is up to 2.9m high. Surrounding the rampart is an outer ditch which measures up to 5.4m wide and 0.4m deep and this is visible on all sides of the monument, although it is predominantly preserved as a buried feature. On the north eastern side, the outer edge of this ditch is defined by a field boundary bank and the infilled ditch has been used in the past as a track. There is an inturned entrance on the north eastern side which measures 7m wide, and the inturned banks are up to 2.2m wide and 0.4m high. The enclosure is crossed by a parish boundary bank which measures up to 2m wide and 1.5m high, and has been partially cut at the north eastern corner by a quarry, approximately 20m long, 15m wide and up to 2.8m deep, which lies to the north of the entrance. A further quarry lies to the south of the parish boundary bank, on the western side of the enclosure and measures 8.7m long, 5.3m wide and up to 1m deep. A third quarry lies to the north west and has partially cut into the ditch and rampart on this side; however much of this quarry lies just beyond the monument itself. A further entrance to the enclosure may lie on the western side, where the rampart is seen <b>to</b> <b>kink</b> slightly inwards. The stock proof fences around the rampart and ditch, the gates and gateposts which facilitate access, the Ordnance Survey triangulation point which is situated on the north eastern side of the enclosure just above the quarry, and the field boundary bank which defines the outer edge of the ditch in the north eastern corner are excluded from the scheduling, although the ground beneath all these features is included.|$|E
