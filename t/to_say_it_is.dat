5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it may have also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E

The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Xenogears was released, {{there was}} {{speculation}} of a sequel being released, although this never occurred. In 1999, Tanaka {{said that a}} project related to Xenogears was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to Xenogears was initially planned, but never came to be. While Xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft's Xenosaga was a prequel {{when it was first}} announced. Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both Xenogears and Xenosaga and has noted that [...] "with our relation between Square, I think it is difficult for us <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a direct sequel or prequel". Approximately twenty members of the Xenosaga development staff had previously worked on Xenogears.|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{commentators}} have described Inchon {{as the worst}} film ever made, including The Washington Post, [...] Newsweek, TV Guide, and the Canadian Press. Inchon was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including The Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved, and The Worst Movies of All Time by Michael Sauter. In 2000, Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, writing in the libertarian magazine Reason, said about a proposed film on Stalinism: [...] "A film like this could easily have turned out as big a didactic dud as the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's 1982 bomb, Inchon, with Laurence Olivier as Gen. Douglas MacArthur." [...] A 2009 review by Phil Hall for Film Threat was less negative, and he disagreed with the characterization of the film as the worst ever made, [...] "I was genuinely surprised — this is hardly among the very worst films of all time. That's not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good film. It is a dull and forgettable movie, and I would never recommend it. However, its reputation for being among {{the bottom of the}} cinematic barrel is wholly undeserved." ...|$|E

500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E
500|$|Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet {{received}} a positive review from journalist Rebecca O'Connell, {{who wrote in}} the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, [...] "The authors convey the awe and wonderment of seeing Earth from space and the intricate delicacy of the Earth's ecology". She said of the descriptive nature of the text, [...] "Their descriptions of scientific phenomena read like revelations of mystic wonders. But this is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ponderous, not at all." [...] O'Connell's review concluded, [...] "The text is packed with fascinating information and humorous touches. Even children who are not ordinarily interested in space or ecology will be interested in this book, and aficionados will go ga-ga." [...] Leigh Fenly of The San Diego Union-Tribune recommended the book, and said, [...] "Science writer June English tracked the launch and adds perspective on how the mission will help scientists understand Earth, including its atmosphere, geology, ecologyand future". Nita Thurman wrote for The Dallas Morning News, [...] "Mission: Earth, A Journey to the Home Planet has dozens of color photos taken inside the shuttle and through its windows. The astronaut's descriptions are vivid." [...] Publishers Weekly wrote favorably of the book, saying, [...] "Astronaut Jones's enthusiasm for his work is contagious; it shines through the text, making for a roundly enjoyable and informative read". Publishers Weekly recommended the book and said it is, [...] "ell-conceived and thoughtfully executed, this book deserves a wide audience." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E
