Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E

The German battlefleet departed the Jade at 03:30 on 31 May. Westfalen was assigned to the II Division of the I Battle Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral W. Engelhardt. Westfalen was the last ship in the division, astern of her three sisters. The II Division was the last unit of dreadnoughts in the fleet; they were followed by only the elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron.|$|E

After the refit, she resumed her training cruises, generally at two-year intervals, until she ran aground in 1935. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> her bottom was severe enough that the IJN decided make her a stationary training ship in 1938.|$|E

5|$|For 11days, the JTWC on Guam {{was unable}} to {{continue}} operations, relying on a backup agency. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the airport radar prompted the NEXRADa network of high-resolution weather radarsto be installed earlier than scheduled, in February 1993, and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime.

In {{the aftermath of the}} destruction, insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete. In January 1996, former Governor Carl Gutierrez issued an executive order, mandating that homes or storm shutters on the island withstand winds of at least 250m/h (155mph).|$|E

5|$|In 1890 the Prison Commissioners {{agreed to}} declare Clifford's Tower a {{national}} monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford's Tower {{was given to}} the York Corporation, together with a grant of £3,000 (£242,000 at 2009 prices) arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing a recurrence of the 14th century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford's Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument.|$|E
