There are many parameters that influence {{the performance of the}} network; network latency, target token rotation time, <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time,</b> frame size and maximum access delay. The maximum access delay, the time between successive transmission opportunities, is bounded for both synchronous and asynchronous traffic. In our analysis, we set the value of TTRT and optimized the value of access delay. It is concludedthat long delays are not desirable and can be avoided by proper setting of network parameters...|$|E

The minimal value is essential in order to avoid unbounded queue length for the synchronous class as well as to achieve high network responsiveness. The results have been obtained for synchronous messages generated according to a generic periodic pattern with no constraint for the shape and for the period of the pattern.

Type- 3 LLC service is analyzed since it appears particularly attractive in industrial LANs concerned with real-time activities and adopting reduced protocol profiles.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in real-time distributed systems research have produced quality-of-service (QoS) technologies that allow asynchronous real-time distributed systems to specify and dynamically negotiate service expectations such as timeliness and survivability, {{which was not}} previously possible under classical real-time theory. However, the real-time QoS literature focuses primarily on dynamic adaptation strategies that are done at the process-level. Therefore, the effectiveness of trans-node message-level adaptation is not known. In this paper, we present adaptive communication algorithms that perform adaptation at the trans-node message-level through mechanisms such as dynamic message reprioritization and run-time alteration of <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> <b>times.</b> We present an adaptive communication heuristic that adapts periodic computations to changing workloads through dynamic message reprioritization and achieve their real-time requirements for IEEE 802. 5 token ring networks that support the prio [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of tracking perturbations in discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS) {{depends on the}} systems' perturbation propagation mechanism and {{on the length of}} the event trace. Existing perturbation propagation algorithms assume that all unperturbed event times are observed and that all perturbed times are required. This paper concerns a complementary approach, termed perturbation tracking (PT), that accurately tracks perturbations in systems for which only a subset of event times are known. We apply PT to a class of partiallyobserved, timed Petri nets and show that for accurate tracking it is necessary and sufficient to know the <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> between observations. We conclude with an example, motivated by a practical software monitoring problem, that illustrates how this information can be derived from structural and event trace analysis.

40|$|Abstract-The IEEE 802. 5 {{token ring}} {{protocol}} defines eight packet priorities. The intent is that “high priority ” packets should be delivered prior to “low priority ” packets. Through {{a series of}} simulations we show that this expected behavior occurs under {{a unique set of}} circumstances: when there are very few network stations, very short data packets (but still long relative to ring latency), very short <b>token</b> <b>hold</b> <b>times,</b> and very high network load. In the general case, we found that priorities did not markedly influence packet delivery time. Use of the priority system generally resulted in more overhead and longer average packet delays than when all packets were carried as a single priority. We mathematically describe the features of the protocol operation that are the cause of this increased delay and lack of priority discrimination. 50 E 03, I I I I I I I I 1 I.

40|$|Abstract — Token Ring is a {{local area}} network which resides in the Data Link Layer (DLL) of the OSI model. Stations on a token ring LAN are logically {{organized}} in a ring topology with data being transmitted sequentially from one ring station to the next with a control token circulating around the ring controlling access. Each station passes or repeats the special token frame around the ring to its nearest downstream neighbour. This token-passing process is used to arbitrate access to the shared ring media. Stations that have data frames to transmit must first acquire the token before they can transmit them. It can transmit the packet for fixed duration decided by <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time.</b> Here we have analyzed its performance for a given number of nodes for balanced and unbalanced traffic flow and varied the size of packet {{to find out the}} optimum packet size for both balanced and unbalanced traffic flow.

40|$|Vehicular {{communication}} {{has been}} an emerging topic among current wireless research. The vehicular communication can be classified to Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) and Road-to-Vehicle Communication (RVC). IVC and RVC support applications mainly on two aspects: safety applications aiming to reduce dangers on the road, and data applications aiming to provide information and entertainment to people on traveling. Vehicles nearby form Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) without any fixed infrastructures. Due to the characteristics of vehicular networks such as quickly changing and unstable network topology, IVC has special requirements to the network protocols. Several MAC protocols have been appeared or improved based on previous work for IVC. But these protocols are designed either for QoS guaranteed data service or for reliable message broadcast. There is not a protocol including both application requirements and inexpensive to implement as well. MAC protocol for vehicular communication hasn’t been finalized. In this thesis, an overlay token ring protocol (OTRP) is proposed which can work on MAC layer with broadcast function and taking into the IVC features into consideration. In OTRP, vehicles are grouped to overlapped rings with a token passed in each ring as the sole right for transmission. The ring is dynamically updated in a distributed manner based on smart algorithm at each node. OTRP provides bounded delay by assigning maximum <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> for each node. It also reduces collisions by decreasing the number of contention nodes by times of ring size. Fair and high throughput is obtained as well. Furthermore, it provides reliable and prompt broadcast of emergency messages by pre-emptively transmitting while applying the token as an acknowledgement. The time nodes reliably receive the message is within limit. Theoretical analysis is provided and simulation results are given to evaluate the performance of OTRP under saturated traffic conditions both in safety and data applications...|$|E
40|$|We present {{adaptive}} communication heuristic algorithms for periodic {{tasks in}} asynchronous real-time distributed systems. The heuristic algorithms adapt the application to workload changes through trans-node message-level adaptation mechanisms. We present adaptive communication heuristics for IEEE 802. 5 token ring networks {{that support the}} prioritydriven protocol and for FDDI networks that use the Timed Token protocol. The heuristic algorithms adapt periodic computations of the application to workload changes by reprioritizing application messages and by dynamically changing <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> at processor nodes, respectively. The objective of the heuristics is to minimize (end-to-end) missed deadline ratios of the tasks. We study {{the performance of the}} techniques through a combination of benchmarking and simulation. The performance of the heuristics is compared with an adaptive resource management algorithm that performs adaptation by dynamically replicating application processes for load sharing. The experimental results indicate that the adaptive communication strategies outperform the process replication algorithm for load patterns that cause communication latencies to grow faster than execution latencies. Moreover, we also observe that the adaptive communication algorithms perform as good as the process replication algorithm for load patterns that cause execution latencies to grow faster than communication latencies. 1...|$|R
