60|$|Along {{the river}} front {{was a long}} line of squatty warehouses, backed up by narrow and far from clean streets, where the places of {{business}} were huddled together, and where a good share of <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>was</b> done on the sidewalk. The population was a very much mixed one, but of the Europeans the English and French predominated. The natives were short, fat, and exceedingly greasy appearing. Hardly a one of them could speak English.|$|E
60|$|The {{party from}} Elmhurst lunched at the Fairview Hotel, {{and then the}} girls hurried to the Opera House while Kenneth {{remained}} to attend a conference of the Republican Committee. These gentlemen were much worried over {{the discovery of a}} scheme to trade votes that had been sprung, and that Forbes and Reynolds were being sacrificed for Hopkins and Cummings. Mr. Cummings was called into the meeting, and he denied that <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>was</b> being done with his consent, but defiantly refused to make a public announcement to that effect.|$|E
6000|$|In the morning, {{bright and}} early, Snettishane {{put in an}} ominous {{appearance}} and was set to breakfast {{in the kitchen with}} Wanidani. He refused [...] "squaw food," [...] and a little later bearded his son-in-law in the store where <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>was</b> done. Having learned, he said, that his daughter was such a jewel, he had come for more blankets, more tobacco, and more guns--especially more guns. He had certainly been cheated in her price, he held, and he had come for justice. But the Factor had neither blankets nor justice to spare. Whereupon he was informed that Snettishane had seen the missionary at Three Forks, who had notified him that such marriages were not made in heaven, and that it was his father's duty to demand his daughter back.|$|E
40|$|Bushmeat {{is a large}} but largely {{invisible}} {{contributor to}} the economies of west and central African countries. Yet <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>is</b> currently unsustainable.

Most of the men went up to see the fun, but I persuaded two of my mates in my boat to stop quiet with me. Presently I heard a yell from the camp, which was about three hundred yards away. 'That's mischief,' says I. I had scarce spoken when there was a yelling fit to make your har stand on end, and I heard pistol-shots. 'Quick,' lads, says I, 'catch up a hatchet and stave a hole in the other boats, and push ours a little way out from the bank.' We warn't long in doing that, and then we stopped and listened.|$|E

5000|$|Economy: The {{main source}} of trade and {{production}} for the Wichqana people included agriculture (potatoes, ocas, ullucus, maca, etc.) and pastoralism and the two main animals that were used for herding were llamas and alpacas. Along with agriculture and herding, hunting was also {{a large part of}} the economy which included common animals such as deer, rodents, and birds.

50|$|In the 1950s Finland was {{the most}} {{important}} market for Colombian coffee. Finland and Colombia signed a bilateral trade agreement in 1959 and Colombian coffee was paid with Sisu's thereafter. <b>The</b> <b>trading</b> <b>was</b> handled via Banco Cafetero until it changed multilateral in 1968. Colombia grew the most important export destination of Sisu's. SAT had plans of starting local production in Medellín jointly with Leyland Motors but the project was eventually cancelled due to financial risks. In the early 1970s the Andean Community of Nations decided about starting its own lorry production and the successful trading came to end after about 1200 sold units.|$|E
50|$|New {{problems}} came in 1931 {{during the}} Great Depression; Wärtsilä's financial situation got alarming {{and it was}} on verge of bankruptcy. <b>The</b> <b>trading</b> <b>was</b> stopped in Helsinki stock exchange. But two factors saved the company; the first one was galvanised wire production, which Wärtsilä had started right before the depression as the first company in the Nordic Countries. The second one was the company personnel which agreed about lowering of salaries in order to save the company. Already in 1932 Wärtsilä could pay dividend to its shareholders and the same trend continued in the following years.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{has shown}} that the first known Muslim to arrive in Barbados was over one hundred years ago when in 1913 Abdul Rohul Amin, a silk {{merchant}} from West Bengal came to Barbados. Soon after, some more Bengalis arrived and they shared a house in Wellington Street, in the City. Some of them also lived in Milk Market and Tudor Street (upstairs Bata Shoe Shop) in Bridgetown. Most of these Bengalis married local Barbadian women and started families in Bridgetown. Today many well-known Barbadians are the grandchildren of these unions. These Muslims started the itinerant trading process, which continues up to this day. In the early stages most of <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>was</b> with poor Barbadians living in the country areas who found it difficult to get to Bridgetown to do their shopping. The traders would take the bus to get their wares {{to the people in the}} country. If there were no buses available they would walk long distances just to accommodate the customers. Over the years, these traders built up a relationship with Barbadians, which still remains of mutual benefit. [...] Following the Bengalis, Muslims from villages in Gujarat, West India arrived. It is reported that the first of the Gujarati Muslims came in 1929. These Muslims had set out for Brazil to cut timber but ended up in Guyana and stayed there for a while. In Guyana they learnt that there was money in coal trading with Barbados. They visited Bridgetown a couple of times by boat and then decided to make Barbados their home.|$|E
