5|$|During {{the period}} of time in which the battleships were out of {{commission}} in the United States, several technological updates and breakthroughs enabled naval ships, submarines, and aircraft <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> absence of big guns within the fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, in {{an effort}} to improve {{navigation}} around the bridge and reduce accidents, two of the piers were removed, making the widest span a more easily navigated , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron girders <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> missing piers.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal {{migrants}} minimize predation, avoid overheating, and {{can feed}} during the day. One cost of nocturnal migration {{is the loss}} of sleep. Migrants may be able to alter their quality of sleep <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>compensating</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dynamic {{nature of}} {{the field in the}} undersensing case, we would also like to eliminate any redundant sensing. Recall, that in the oversensing case, the field changes very slowly, yielding perfect reconstruction and detection. This makes it necessary to monitor the field over multiple frames for detecting any signs of oversensing.|$|R

5|$|One {{major element}} of {{pressure}} on producers is the unchanged exchange regime of the Central Bank of Iran, which puts imported products at an advantage by failing <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> relative increase in production costs of domestic producers.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lack of budget, a {{very tight}} {{shooting}} schedule was planned over 28 days, during which Kenneth Branagh was only available for two weeks and was performing on-stage nightly in London.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the standard MP 40 (sometimes erroneously called MP 40/II) with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the Eastern Front <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.|$|E

5000|$|The city of Waterloo {{receives}} $340,000 {{annually from}} the power centre <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> power centre's [...] "negative impacts on uptown Waterloo".|$|R
5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|After the hurricane's passage, {{officials}} deployed the Florida National Guard to {{affected areas}} {{in order to}} maintain order and quell looting. Across Florida, a total of 3,897people filed damage claims after receiving damage from the hurricane, 80% of them in the Miami area. Insurance companies paid about $1million <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> storm damage. Due to the loss in citrus crop, prices briefly increased, although they returned to normal levels by late October.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
50|$|On March 14, 2017, Cooper {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with <b>the</b> Cowboys, <b>to</b> help <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of Ronald Leary (free agency) and Doug Free (retirement).|$|R

5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not {{the presence of other}} planets.|$|E
5|$|In 1735 Harrison {{built his}} first chronometer, which he {{steadily}} improved {{on over the}} next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, {{including the use of}} bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, {{while under}} repair for combat damage, Mississippi {{received}} a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight {{more of the}} 25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns. <b>To</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> added weight, the ship's armored conning tower was removed.|$|E
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> this, <b>the</b> {{producers}} focused {{some stories}} on previously overlooked DC Comics characters. These included characters like Deadman, Warlord, and an unnamed modern equivalent of The Seven Soldiers of Victory.|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 miles to the east in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this {{assignment}} that she suffered a near-catastrophe when she ran aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, and gently ran aground sideways when the senior flagship's navigator failed <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.|$|E
5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
50|$|The double {{effort is}} {{typically}} used <b>to</b> mutually <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> intrinsical {{weaknesses of the}} various methods {{in order to increase}} the overall reliability and accuracy or to speed up AF function.|$|R
50|$|Retainer weld nuts, {{also known}} as bridge weld nuts, have a {{floating}} nut retained inside a retainer <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> inconsistencies. <b>The</b> retainer is welded to the workpiece while the nut is allowed to float.|$|R

5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|Vision, chemoreception (tongue-flicking) {{and hearing}} are {{important}} senses for terrestrial snakes but these stimuli become distorted in water. The poor visibility, chemical dilution and limitation of ground-borne vibrations underwater suggest that sea snakes and sea kraits may have unique sensory abilities <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{relative lack of}} other sensory cues.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{converted}} into an escort destroyer in late 1943, 'B' gun {{was replaced by}} a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and stowage was increased for a total of 70 depth charges which meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder AA gun had to be removed <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> weight. A Type 271 target-indication radar replaced the director. It is likely that the Vickers guns were replaced by the Oerlikons from the quarterdeck at this time.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} chosen by Cardiff Harbour Authority, who manage Cardiff Bay, to create an {{important}} new environment from the previous salt marsh, and <b>to</b> help <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of the Cardiff Bay mudflats.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} verse, Dickens gets {{a call from}} his laundryman, who returns $100 that Dickens left in his clothes. Dickens gives him 10 cents, <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> phone call.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{explanation}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{paradox is}} than, when {{the quantity of}} x decreases, its price increases, {{and the increase in}} price is more than sufficient <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> Alice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decrease in quantity.|$|R
