5|$|Bolton {{reached the}} Premiership in 1995 {{thanks to a}} 4–3 victory over Reading in the Division One {{play-off}} Final. Reading took a 2–0 lead before a Keith Branagan penalty save on <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> half time {{changed the course of}} the game. Bolton scored two late goals to take the game to extra time, scoring twice more before a late Reading consolation. The same year Bolton progressed to the League Cup Final, but were defeated 2–1 by Liverpool. Bolton were bottom for virtually all of the 1995–96 Premiership campaign and were relegated as they lost their penultimate game 1–0 to Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E
5|$|Late that evening, a two-coach staff train {{pulled out}} of Brill, {{accompanied}} by a band playing Auld Lang Syne and a white flag. The train stopped at each station along the route, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> midnight, the rails connecting the tramway to the Metropolitan Railway main line were ceremonially severed.|$|E

5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as fast as he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E
5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight services, and to {{concentrate}} on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. In particular, he saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 30 November 1935 the last train ran on the Brill Tramway between Brill and Quainton Road, and at <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed. The former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway between Quainton Road and Verney Junction was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936, and London Transport services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn.|$|E

Leela sympathizes with Fryshe too is alone, and hates her jobso she quits and joins Fry and Bender as job deserters. The three track down Professor Farnsworth, founder of an intergalactic delivery company called Planet Express. With the help of Professor Farnsworth, the three evade the police by launching the Planet Express Ship at <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> midnight amid the New Year's fireworks. As the year 3000 begins, Farnsworth hires the three as the crew of his ship. Fry inquires at what his job is, and learns that he will be a delivery boy. Fry, ironically, cheers at his new job.|$|E
5|$|The last {{scheduled}} {{passenger train}} on the Brill Tramway left Quainton Road {{in the afternoon}} of 30 November 1935. Hundreds of people gathered, {{and a number of}} members of the Oxford University Railway Society travelled from Oxford in an effort to buy the last ticket. Accompanied by firecrackers and fog signals, the train ran to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph. Late that evening, a two-coach staff train pulled out of Brill, accompanied by a band bearing a white flag and playing Auld Lang Syne. The train stopped at each station, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts.

5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E

5|$|Feyenoord opened December with a {{home game}} against PSV. The {{visitors}} took an early lead but Boëtius scored an equalizer {{in the first half}} stoppage time. Pellè added a penalty goal in the second half; several minutes later he got another attempt which he missed. Pellè later added another goal to the tally for a 3–1 Feyenoord win. The team moved back into fourth place in the league table after the first 15 games of the season. On 8 December Feyenoord played SC Heerenveen on the road. Feyenoord scored twice within the first quarter of an hour; Boëtius opened the score and Immers doubled the lead. The game ended as a 2–1 win after Heerenveen got on the board at <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> half-time. The win kept Feyenoord in fourth place in the Eredivisie standings. On 15 December, Feyenoord played FC Groningen at home. Pellè scored the lone goal of the game in the seventh minute of play. This third consecutive win kept Feyenoord in fourth place at the halfway mark of the season with 30 points from 17 matches. Feyenoord played their fourth round KNVB cup match in Almelo against Heracles Almelo on 18 December. Pellè scored after 11 minutes, Heracles equalized midway through the first half. Three minutes into extra time De Vrij received a second yellow card; Feyenoord kept the 1–1 score throughout extra time with ten men. In the penalty shootout all initial ten shooters scored. Clasie scored the sixth Feyenoord penalty before Heracles' Rienstra missed, sending Feyenoord to the quarter-finals of the KNVB Cup. Feyenoord's last game of 2013, at home against PEC Zwolle, marked their 2000th professional league game. They won the game 3–0 due to two first half goals in a seven-minute span by Immers and an early second half goal by Boëtius. This marked the last game before the winter break. Their five-game winning streak led them to fourth place in the league and the quarter-finals of the cup heading into the new year.|$|E
