25|$|During {{a public}} meeting at Zion United Methodist Church in Marion on February 28 after Jackson's death, {{emotions}} were running high. James Bevel, {{as director of}} the Selma voting rights movement for SCLC, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery to talk to Governor George Wallace directly about Jackson's death, and to ask him if he had ordered the State Troopers to turn off the lights and attack the marchers. Bevel strategized that this would focus <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> pain of the people of Marion and Selma toward a nonviolent goal, as many were so outraged they wanted to retaliate with violence.|$|E
25|$|Again, to the Salon d'Automne of 1913 - a salon {{in which}} Cubism {{was now the}} predominating {{tendency}} - Metzinger sent the great picture called En Bâteau (En Canot, Im Boot), La Fresnaye La Conquête de l'Air, myself Les Bâteaux de Pêche and La Ville et le Fleuve.

500|$|Silverchair began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Freak Show, in May 1996 while experiencing {{the success of}} Frogstomp in Australia and the US. It was produced by [...] Nick Launay (Birthday Party, Models, Midnight Oil) and was released in February 1997. The album reached number-one in Australia and yielded three Top10 singles – [...] "Freak", [...] "Abuse Me", and [...] "Cemetery". Its fourth single, [...] "The Door", reached No.25. The songs focused on <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> backlash that the expectations of Frogstomp brought upon the band. Freak Show was certified gold in the US, 2× platinum in Australia and global sales eventually exceeded 1.5million copies.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Alanna Nash {{also gave}} the album {{positive}} feedback, viewing the album to have [...] "enough boiling rhythms and brooding melodies to reflect <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> disillusionment {{of the middle}} class in the '90s", calling the track [...] "She Thinks His Name Was John" [...] to be the best example of that idea. The song was eventually spawned as a single and was considered controversial for its storyline, which described a woman who contracts AIDS from a one-night stand. Due to its subject matter, the song garnered less of a response from radio and peaked at No. 15. Read My Mind became another major seller for McEntire and her label, selling three million copies by 1995 and certifying at 3× Multi-Platinum from the RIAA.|$|E

British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release, Locked Out from the Inside (2009), and indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her: [...] "For me, the thing that I loved about them and her [...] was <b>the</b> <b>anger,</b> <b>and</b> aggressiveness, along with the tender side", said Niblett. [...] "That was something I hadn't seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring.

[...] Phillip Maciak, writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, named Kristen Schaal's voice acting as Louise on Bob's Burgers as his favorite television performance {{of the year and}} cited her performance in the episode: [...] "Schaal's handling of <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> betrayal Louise feels as she finds herself attracting to a boy for the first time is actually quite moving. But, more than that, it opens up a new register of this top-register performance as Louise’s murderous rage turns to murderous romance." ...|$|E
500|$|Dreyer {{had always}} {{stated that the}} band's second album would feature [...] "a lot of storytelling", [...] "a lot of groove", and [...] "a more of an organic feel" [...] than their debut album. When {{describing}} {{the sound of the}} album the band wrote that they believe it is [...] "musically more heavy and more soft, more fast and more slow, more complicated and more straight-forward, and I know my band mates would agree, so there isn't really a thing this record sounds like, at least not that we can hear." [...] With writer Vladimir Nabokov's works Pale Fire and Lolita being considered as the [...] "biggest external influence" [...] on Wildlife, the album features dark lyrical themes that focus on personal loss and <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> despair felt from watching one's hometown decay, as well as dealing with personal loss, whether it is faith, a friend, or a family member.|$|E

The {{figures in the}}m are physically divided by the name tablet {{but they are also}} divided by a range of human emotions that turn them outward or in on themselves and sometimes towards their partner with jealousy, suspicion, rage or simply boredom. In them Michelangelo has portrayed <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> unhappiness of the human condition, painting [...] "the daily round of merely domestic life {{as if it were a}} curse". In their constraining niches, the ancestors [...] "sit, squat and wait". Of the fourteen lunettes, the two that were probably painted first, the families of Eleazar and Mathan and of Jacob and Joseph are the most detailed.

500|$|Bigelow was {{motivated}} to start work on Strange Days shortly {{after a series}} of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, [...] "I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> frustration and economic disparity in which we live." [...] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make [...] "valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression." [...] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, deHavilland {{appeared}} in Elliott Nugent's romantic comedy The Male Animal with Henry Fonda, about an idealistic professor fighting for academic freedom {{while trying to}} hold onto his job and his wife Ellen. While her role was not particularly challenging, deHavilland's delineation of an intelligent, good-natured woman trying to resolve the unsettling circumstances of her life played a major part in the film's success, according to Tony Thomas. The film was a critical and commercial success, with Bosley Crowther of The Times noting that deHavilland [...] "concocts a delightfully pliant and saucy character as the wife". That year, she also {{appeared in}} John Huston's drama In This Our Life with Bette Davis. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel {{of the same name}} by Ellen Glasgow, the story is about two sisters whose lives are destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> jealousy of one of the sisters. Crowther gave the film a negative review, but noted deHavilland's [...] "warm and easy performance". During production, deHavilland and Huston began a romantic relationship that lasted three years.|$|E

40|$|Five {{hundred and}} twenty seven volunteers of IFOTES (International Federation of Telephone Emergency Services) {{answered}} to questions about their affective life in three contextual situations: IFOTES itself, at WORK and in FAMILY. We computed explorative analyses about the emotions' frequency, and about the emotions more difficult and easier to deal with. We then studied the relationships between contexts and strategies used to regulate <b>the</b> other's <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. We measured total scores and sub-scores cognitive and affective empathy by mean of the Basic Empathy Scale of Jollife, 2005. And then we compared groups high and low empathy focusing on the frequency of strategies' uses and on success at regulating <b>the</b> other's <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. <b>The</b> findings exhibit similar patterns of emotions' frequencies. IFOTES and WORK contexts share more features than IFOTES and FAMILY contexts do. Strategies to deal with <b>the</b> other's <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> other's anxiety were chosen according to contexts and emotions. Both strategies' utilisation and perceived success at regulating emotions seem to be explained better when we put them {{in connection with the}} sub-scores cognitive and affective empathy...|$|R
500|$|In 1991, {{a concert}} of female-led bands at the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, Washington, heralded the {{emerging}} riot grrrl phenomenon. Billed as [...] "Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now", the concert's lineup included Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, L7, and Mecca Normal. The riot grrrl movement foregrounded feminist concerns and progressive politics in general; the DIY ethic and fanzines were also central {{elements of the}} scene. This movement relied on media and technology to spread their ideas and messages, creating a cultural-technological space for feminism to voice their concerns. They embodied the punk perspective, taking <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> emotions and creating a separate culture from it. With riot grrrl, they were grounded in girl punk past, but also rooted in modern feminism. Singer-guitarists Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17, bands active in both the queercore and riot grrrl scenes, cofounded the indie/punk band Sleater-Kinney in 1994. Bikini Kill's lead singer, Kathleen Hanna, the iconic figure of riot grrrl, moved on to form the art punk group Le Tigre in 1998.|$|E

Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls you both, so they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns <b>the</b> <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, [...] "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.|$|E
