5|$|After {{the failure}} of naval attacks, it was decided <b>that</b> <b>ground</b> forces were {{necessary}} to eliminate the Turkish mobile artillery and allow minesweepers to clear the waters for larger vessels. The British Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) that was {{to carry out the}} mission. The MEF consisted of Birdwood's ANZAC, British 29th Division, British Royal Naval Division and the French Corps expéditionnaire d'Orient. Some 40,000 Russian troops would participate in the capture or occupation of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped <b>that</b> <b>ground</b> tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} thought <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> is a hyperintensional phenomenon. Unfortunately, the term ‘hyperintensionality’ {{has been doing}} double-duty, picking out two {{distinct}} phenomena. This paper clears up this conceptual confusion. We call the two resulting notions hyperintensionalityGRND and hyperintensionalityTRAD. While it is clear <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> is hyperintensionalGRND, the interesting question is whether it is hyperintensionalTRAD. We argue that given well-accepted constraints on the logical form of <b>grounding,</b> to wit, <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> is irreflexive and asymmetric, grounding is hyperintensionalTRAD only if one endorses a sentential operator view of <b>grounding.</b> We argue <b>that</b> proponents of the sentential operator view will need to distinguish two importantly different kinds of hyperintensionalityTRAD—weak and strong—and we offer them {{a way to do}} so...|$|R
40|$|Attempts to {{elucidate}} grounding are often made by connecting grounding to metaphysical explanation, {{but the notion}} of metaphysical explanation is itself opaque, and has received little attention in the literature. We can appeal to theories of explanation {{in the philosophy of}} science to give us a characterization of metaphysical explanation, but this reveals a tension between three theses: <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> relations are objective and mind-independent; that there are pragmatic elements to metaphysical explanation; and <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> and metaphysical explanation share a close connection. Holding fixed the mind-independence of <b>grounding,</b> I show <b>that</b> neither horn of the resultant dilemma can be blunted. Consequently, we should reject the assumption <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> relations are mind-independent...|$|R
5|$|From 1978, Ecclestone was {{president}} of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis <b>that</b> <b>ground</b> effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the Research Octane Number (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.|$|E

Sunderland's season took off with a victory at home against Tottenham, as Michael Chopra scored in the last minute. After a derby victory over Middlesbrough, and with teams below failing to win, Sunderland secured their Premier League status for the 2008–09 season. On 25 October 2008, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United 2–1 at the Stadium of Light, their first home win over them since 1980, {{and the first time}} they had ever defeated them at <b>that</b> <b>ground.</b> on 4 December 2008, Keane left Sunderland after a run of defeats in the Premier League. First-team coach Ricky Sbragia took over as caretaker manager, and on 27 December 2008 Sbragia took the job on a permanent basis, signing an 18-month contract. Despite promising early results, the team continued to struggle and narrowly avoided relegation from the Premiership {{on the last day of}} the season, after which Sbragia resigned from his post.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes a fact {{can play}} a role in a {{grounding}} explanation, but the particular content of that fact make no difference to the explanation—any fact would do in its place. I call these facts vacuous <b>grounds.</b> I show <b>that</b> applying the distinction between-vacuous grounds allows us to give a principled solution to Kit Fine and Stephen Kramer’s paradox of (reflexive) ground. This paradox shows that on minimal assumptions about grounding and minimal assumptions about logic, we can show <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> is reflexive, contra the intuitive character of <b>grounds.</b> I argue <b>that</b> we should never have accepted <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> is irreflexive in the first place; the intuitions that support the irreflexive intuition plausibly only require <b>that</b> <b>grounding</b> be non-vacuously irreflexive.

Having first addressed an immediate objection to the position under discussion, I introduce two examples of symmetric grounding.

These arguments are: (i) that metaphysical interdependence is the only theory able to reconcile competing intuitions about grounding; (ii) that it is the only theory consistent with both ‘gunk’ and ‘junk’; and (iii) that offers a satisfactory solution to the problem concerning whether or not grounding is itself grounded...|$|R
