5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Windows</b> Push Notification Service (WNS) was {{designed}} as a successor to the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS), which was only supported natively on <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> Phone 8 Operating System. Developers can still use the MPNS on apps that are installed on newer versions of Windows Mobile (Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1), but only if <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> application was already registered to use the MPNS and has been converted to a Microsoft Silverlight application and modified to re-target the new platform.|$|E
50|$|If a {{scene is}} viewed through a <b>window</b> <b>the</b> entire scene would {{normally}} be behind <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> if <b>the</b> scene is distant, it would be some distance behind <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> if it is nearby, it {{would appear to be}} just beyond <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> An object smaller than <b>the</b> <b>window</b> itself could even go through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and appear partially or completely in front of it. The same applies to a part of a larger object that is smaller than <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>The</b> goal of setting <b>the</b> stereo <b>window</b> is to duplicate this effect.|$|R

50|$|The {{decorative}} {{frame and}} title bar (possibly including buttons) {{that is usually}} seen around windows are created by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager, not by the client that creates <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>The</b> <b>window</b> manager also handles input related to these elements, such as resizing <b>the</b> <b>window</b> when <b>the</b> user clicks and drags <b>the</b> <b>window</b> frame. Clients usually operate on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> they created disregarding the changes operated by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager. A change it has {{to take into account}} is that re-parenting window managers, which almost all modern window managers are, change the parent of top-level windows to a window that is not the root. From {{the point of view of}} the core protocol, <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager is a client, not different from the other applications.|$|R
50|$|When {{a window}} manager is running, {{some kinds of}} {{interaction}} between the X server and its clients are redirected through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager. In particular, whenever an attempt to show a new window is made, this request is redirected to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager, which decides the initial position of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Additionally, most modern window managers are reparenting, which usually leads to a banner being placed {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and a decorative frame being drawn around <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> These two elements are controlled by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager rather than the program. Therefore, when the user clicks or drags these elements, it is <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager that takes the appropriate actions (such as moving or resizing <b>the</b> <b>window).</b>|$|R

5|$|A public beta {{program for}} Windows10 known as <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> Insider Program (previously Windows Technical Preview) {{began with the}} first {{publicly}} available preview release on October 1, 2014. Insider preview builds are aimed towards enthusiasts and enterprise users for the testing and evaluation of updates and new features. Users of <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> Insider program receive occasional updates to newer preview builds of the operating system {{and will continue to}} be able to evaluate preview releases after general availability (GA) in July 2015this is in contrast to previous Windows beta programs, where public preview builds were released less frequently and only during the months preceding GA. Windows Insider builds continued being released after the release to manufacturing (RTM) of Windows10.|$|E
5|$|During the 2016 Build keynote, Microsoft {{announced}} an update to the WNS and <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> 10 Operating System {{that will allow}} for Android and iOS devices to forward push notifications received to Windows 10 to be viewed and discarded.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>window</b> manager uses <b>the</b> first {{request to}} {{intercept}} any request for mapping top-level <b>windows</b> (children of <b>the</b> root <b>window).</b> Whenever another application requests the mapping of a top-level <b>window,</b> <b>the</b> server {{does not do}} it but sends an event to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> manager instead. Most <b>window</b> managers reparent <b>the</b> window: they create a larger top-level <b>window</b> (called <b>the</b> frame <b>window)</b> and reparent <b>the</b> original <b>window</b> as a child of it. Graphically, this corresponds to placing <b>the</b> original <b>window</b> inside <b>the</b> frame <b>window.</b> <b>The</b> space of <b>the</b> frame <b>window</b> that is not taken by <b>the</b> original <b>window</b> {{is used for the}} decorative frame around <b>the</b> <b>window</b> (<b>the</b> “border” and the “title bar”).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{instruction}} <b>window</b> has {{a finite}} size, and new instructions can enter <b>the</b> <b>window</b> (usually called dispatch or allocate) only when other instructions leave <b>the</b> <b>window</b> (usually called retire or commit). Instructions enter and leave <b>the</b> instruction <b>window</b> in program order, and an instruction can only leave <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{when it is}} the oldest instruction in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and it has been}} completed. Hence, <b>the</b> instruction <b>window</b> {{can be seen as a}} sliding <b>window</b> in which <b>the</b> instructions can become out-of-order. All execution within <b>the</b> <b>window</b> is speculative (i.e., side-effects are not applied outside the CPU) until it is committed.|$|R

While this was a deliberate decision by Microsoft to push sales of Vista, the game could be enabled to play on Windows XP through an unauthorized third-party patch. The game was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios (codenamed Hired Gun) who worked closely with Bungie. As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows – Live, the game offered Live features not available in the Xbox version, such as guide support and achievements. <b>The</b> <b>Windows</b> port also added two exclusive multiplayer maps and a map editor.|$|E

The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use {{the symbol of the}} cross as other Christian denominations do, due to their focus on the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.|$|E
