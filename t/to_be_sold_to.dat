5|$|As {{part of its}} planned {{acquisition}} of Allbritton Communications, Sinclair originally planned to sell its existing stations in three markets – Charleston, South Carolina, Birmingham, Alabama and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania – where Allbritton already owned stations, but continue to operate them under local marketing agreements. WABM and WTTO in Birmingham and WHP-TV in Harrisburg were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Deerfield Media, and WMMP in Charleston was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Howard Stirk Holdings – a broadcasting company owned by conservative pundit Armstrong Williams.

5|$|In a {{biography}} of Walter Francis White—African-American civil rights leader and N.A.A.C.P president—historian Kenneth Robert Janken notes that White's mother Madeline Harrison traced some of her mixed-race white ancestry to Harrison in Virginia. According to Janken, her family maintained that Dilsia, a female slave belonging to William Henry Harrison, had six children by him, born into slavery. Four were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> a planter in La Grange, Georgia, including a daughter, Marie Harrison. Marie {{was said to be}} Madeline's mother.|$|E

Alternately, it may be adapted into a storage and transport vehicle for crime scene identification equipment, a command post at community events, or support vehicle, such as a logistics unit.

5|$|After Young Frankenstein was written, {{the rights}} were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Columbia Pictures, but after having trouble agreeing on the budget, Wilder, Brooks, and {{producer}} Michael Gruskoff went with 20th Century Fox, where both Brooks and Wilder {{had to sign}} five-year contracts. Young Frankenstein was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II. While filming Young Frankenstein, Wilder had {{an idea for a}} romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes. Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn {{agreed to participate in the}} project, and Wilder began writing what became his directorial début, 1975's The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma to suffer a debilitating injury that resulted in paraplegia. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> the couple.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipality}} {{gave the}} necessary permissions for construction in December 1997, but {{required that the}} club finance the upgrades, which the club could not afford. Kjell Ove Johansen, CEO of Bodø/Glimt's operating company, quit his job in November 1998 in protest against the mayor's and councilors' negative attitude and lack of trust towards Bodø/Glimt regarding the venue plans. On 27 January 1999, the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> the club for NOK7.9 million, with the official take-over date being 1 May. In addition, the company would pay NOK5.5 million to the municipality at a later date, after the venue had become profitable.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{stressed}} {{that he intended}} to bring a better style of play to the team in the coming season but admitted that players would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> balance the books. Deals were already in place to sell Jamie Ward to Derby County for an undisclosed fee, and sign Danny Philliskirk from Chelsea on a free transfer, but Wilson also added to the squad in June by signing Lecsinel Jean-François from his former club Swindon Town, also on a free transfer. After much speculation, and with the players about to return for pre-season training, Darius Henderson was sold to Millwall for an undisclosed fee in order to free up money on the wage bill.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from {{compounds}} where, among others, plantain, coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well. Tree tax on trees such as palmyrah, margosa and iluppai and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each. Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of, among others, stamp duty on clothes (clothes could not be sold privately and had to have official stamp), Taraku or levy on items of food, and Port and customs duties. Columbuthurai, which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at Poonakari with its boat services, {{was one of the}} chief port, and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of Pachilaippalai. Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> foreign buyers. They were shipped abroad from a bay called Urukathurai, which is now called Kayts—a shortened form of Portuguese Caes dos elephantess (Bay of Elephants). Perhaps a peculiarity of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead.|$|E
5|$|At Al's apartment, Woody {{learns that}} he {{is based on a}} 1950s TV show called Woody's Roundup, and that along with the other Roundup toys—Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector—he is set <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the others are excited about going, Woody intends to return home to Andy. Jessie {{explains}} that the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage. When Woody's arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape, but is foiled when Al's television set turns on, and blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next morning, Woody's arm is fixed by a toy repair specialist, and Woody learns that Jessie once belonged to a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. Woody decides to stay, now believing that all toys will eventually get discarded by their owners.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice blocked Gannett {{from using}} an {{agreement}} with Sander Media to operate CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis alongside its own NBC station KSDK, and ordered Gannett to sell KMOV. Even though Gannett planned to operate KMOV separately from KSDK, the Department ruled the agreement to {{be a violation of}} antitrust law, as it would reduce competition for advertising sales. Following the closure of the Belo purchase, Meredith Corporation announced a deal to purchase KMOV, along with KTVK and KASW. As Meredith would have a duopoly between KTVK and its Phoenix CBS affiliate KPHO-TV, KASW was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> SagamoreHill Broadcasting and operated by Meredith under an LMA. As a result of the FCC's scrutiny on any new station sharing agreements, on October 23, 2014, Meredith would backtrack on this plan and instead sell KASW to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, which would operate the station independently of KTVK and KPHO.|$|E

5|$|In late 1964 the RAN {{sought the}} Government's {{approval}} to upgrade Melbourne and purchase {{a force of}} 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. The Skyhawks were intended {{to be used to}} provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land. While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical task for the FAA, the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F-111C aircraft it had ordered would be more effective in this role. Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964, but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time. Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of £9.2 million. This order comprised eight single-seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two-seat TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> a country other than the United States.|$|E

The Flight Operation Center (FOC) at the JAL Building began on 20 September 1996. A holding company for JAL and Japan Airlines System, a carrier merging into JAL, was established on 2 October 2002; the head office of that company, , was in 2-15-1 Kōnan in Shinagawa Intercity, Minato, Tokyo. On 11 August 2003, {{the headquarters of}} JAS moved from Haneda Maintenance Center 1 to the JAL Building. On 25 November 2003, the JALS headquarters moved to the JAL Building. Originally the JAL Building was co-owned by Japan Airlines and Mitsubishi Trading Co.; they co-owned a subsidiary that owned the JAL Building. In 2004 the building was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Nomura Real Estate for 65 billion yen. The contract date was 1 December 2004, and the handover date was 18 March 2005.|$|E

During his first two-and-a-half seasons with the club, Rosický played 75 league matches, scoring nine goals and registering 20 assists. He subsequently agreed to extend his contract with Dortmund in July 2003, signing a deal to stay at the club until 2008. At the end of the season, Rosický was announced as the winner of the Czech Republic's Golden Ball award.|$|E
