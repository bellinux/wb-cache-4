40|$|Students with {{emotional}} or behavioral disorders (EBD) present significant academic and behavior man-agement challenges for educators. As such, educators are constantly seeking interventions that are effec-tive in assisting students with EBD {{to manage their}} own behavior and achieve success in school. One behavioral management approach that educators frequently recommend is the <b>level</b> <b>system.</b> As a first step to better understand <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> we conducted a large-scale survey {{to determine the extent}} of <b>level</b> <b>system</b> use, the characteristics of teacher and students who use <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>level</b> <b>system</b> char-acteristics and procedures, teacher perceptions of <b>level</b> <b>system</b> effectiveness, and teacher satisfaction with <b>level</b> <b>systems.</b> Analysis of data revealed extensive use of <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> similarities and differences between <b>level</b> <b>system</b> users and nonusers, characteristics common to <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> and inconsistencies in perceptions of effectiveness and satisfaction. Finally, we offer implications of our findings for edu-cators and provide suggestions for further <b>level</b> <b>system</b> research. Students {{with emotional}} and behavioral problems present a significant challenge for education professionals.

40|$|The <b>level</b> <b>system</b> is a {{behavioral}} procedure that alters {{the status of}} a participant contingent on his or her behaviors; within each level the amount of reinforcement is different. In most cases, <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> are paired with another form of treatment such as a token economy. In the current study, the effectiveness of a <b>level</b> <b>system</b> with a built in token economy was evaluated within three intensive residential group homes with 3 male participants. Each participant was diagnosed with mental retardation and behavioral issues. The <b>level</b> <b>system</b> was comprised of 5 different levels, each having different privileges and reinforcers. Each participant received token dollars for displaying replacement behaviors and the tokens were used to purchase items from a token store. A preference assessment was conducted to determine the items and their values.

It can be used to: (1) shed light on whether the fluctuations are correlated or independent events; (2) determine if there is a low temperature glass or phase transition among interacting two <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> and if the hierarchical or droplet model can be used to describe the glassy phase; and (3) find the lower bound of the two <b>level</b> <b>system</b> relaxation rate without going to ultralow temperatures. Finally we point out that understanding noise due to two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> is important for technological applications such as quantum qubits that use Josephson junctions.

40|$|Noise and {{decoherence}} {{are major}} obstacles {{to the implementation}} of Josephson junction qubits in quantum computing. Recent experiments suggest that two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> (TLS) in the oxide tunnel barrier are a source of decoherence. We explore two decoherence mechanisms in which these two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> lead to the decay of Rabi oscillations that result when Josephson junction qubits are subjected to strong microwave driving. (A) We consider a Josephson qubit coupled resonantly to a two <b>level</b> <b>system,</b> i. e., the qubit and TLS have equal energy splittings. As a result of this resonant interaction, the occupation probability of the excited state of the qubit exhibits beating. Decoherence of the qubit results when the two <b>level</b> <b>system</b> decays from its excited state by emitting a phonon. (B) Fluctuations of the two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> in the oxide barrier produce fluctuations and 1 /f noise in the Josephson junction critical current I_o. This in turn leads to fluctuations in the qubit energy splitting that degrades the qubit coherence. We compare our results with experiments on Josephson junction phase qubits.

40|$|A {{novel model}} of {{analyzing}} Schmitt trigger as 2 <b>level</b> (metastable/stable) energy <b>system</b> is presented. The {{energy of the}} 2 <b>level</b> <b>system</b> is identified. In an MOS implementation, this arises from the electrostatic potential energy of the electrons on the gate to source capacitance of the cross coupled MOS transistors. The electrostatic energy, upon co-ordinate transformation, (incorporating the nonlinear MOS device behaviour and cross coupling), yields an expression for the 2 <b>level</b> <b>system</b> energy. The 2 <b>level</b> <b>system,</b> described under the transformed co-ordinate, is simulated. Simulation on {{the dynamics of the}} system shows a metastsable state and two stable states, corresponding to the a maximum(metastable) energy and a minimum(stable) energy, as predicted by the energy expression in the model. This result agrees with earlier attempt based on nonlinear dynamic system approach, whereby the potential is interpreted {{from the point of view}} of the gradient of vector field. In addition, the model gives physical design insight on how the change in circuit parameters (such as gm, R), affects the energy characteristics, hence leads to effective design of such 2 <b>level</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
