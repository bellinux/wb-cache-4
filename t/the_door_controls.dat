2500|$|The 1960 Stock trains ran {{mainly on}} the Hainault loop. Following limited trials on the District line {{of a system of}} Automatic Train Operation (ATO) in 1963, the lightly used Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line was used as a testing ground for full ATO in {{preparation}} for its use on the Victoria line. Five of the six 1960-stock trains were adapted at Acton Works. The side doors to the driver's cab were sealed, so that access was normally through the passenger saloon. Since the trains were to be operated by one person, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> were moved from the rear end of the motor car into the cab. The train control equipment was fitted beneath the centre seats, and consisted of a [...] "black box", which interpreted signals received from the running rails. These were picked up by sensing coils mounted on the leading bogie. One rail supplied safety information, which was received continuously. Any failure to obtain this data resulted in a trip-valve operating, which stopped the train. The second rail supplied signal commands, which included speed signals and instructions to start and stop the train. This information was only provided when it was needed. The driver was renamed a train operator, and was responsible for opening and closing the doors at stations, and initiating a start from the stations, by pressing two buttons simultaneously. All other operation, including stopping at signals and restarting when safe to proceed was automatic. The first automatic train entered service on 5 April 1964. The automatic control equipment was temporarily mounted in the passenger saloon, between the cab and the first set of doors, to enable engineers to monitor and adjust it as experience was gained.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possibility}} is automatic train operation, which helps the driver by {{driving the train}} automatically. However, the driver still operates <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> and allows the train to start. ATO is as of 2006 only available on the Green line, where a new signal system was installed in the late 1990s. This signal system, together with the C20 rolling stock, permits the use of ATO. The signalling system on the Red Line is however being replaced with Communications-based train control manufactured by Ansaldo STS which will go into operation in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the middle}} space is overcrowded, {{it may be}} {{impossible}} to properly close and lock the first door, thereby also {{making it impossible to}} open the second door, which of course is the only way by which people, vehicles or materials can successfully exit the controlled area. Even when the sally port has overrides installed within <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> and locking apparatus, the size of the middle space and the physical dimensions and layout of the door openings hamper quick egress of a controlled space through a sally port-type opening.|$|E
50|$|Later in the game, {{the player}} {{encounters}} SCP-079, a malicious artificial intelligence (inhabiting a microcomputer), and learns that it caused the power outage when several Chaos Insurgency spies gave it {{control over the}} facility.

5000|$|In {{the main}} {{campaign}} of the game's first expansion, players {{assume the role}} of a Shadowrunner who has recently arrived in the anarchic free state of Berlin to join a team headed by an old colleague, Monika Sch√§fer. Other members of the team include Dietrich, a former punk rocker turned shaman; Glory, a distant woman who has become heavily augmented with cybernetics; and Eiger, a troll weapons expert and former member of German KSK. On their first mission after the player joins them the team attempts to raid a data vault inside the Harfeld Mansion outside Berlin. The mission goes seriously wrong when the team discovers a military compound underneath the Manor and Monika is killed attempting to hack in and access <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls.</b> Monika mentions something called the [...] "Feuerschwinge" [...] before dying. The team fights off the base's security, encountering a heavily armed and armored Ork named Audran before they manage to escape.|$|E
5000|$|The Victoria {{line was}} to be {{equipped}} for automatic operation, and the driver {{was replaced by a}} [...] "train operator", with responsibility for shutting the doors, and then pressing two buttons simultaneously to start the train, after which the train would move under automatic control until the next station was reached. However, a single controller to allow the trains to be driven manually in the depot or in emergency while in service was provided. This incorporated both traction control and braking. Door controls were provided in the cabs, and a facility to isolate either of the two units from the leading cab was also included. For the first time on tube stock, all control circuits were switched by cam-operated micro-switches. They were used on the traction and brake controller, the disconnecting units, the fault isolating switches, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> and other control equipment, and resulted in a significant reduction in the routine electrical inspection needing to be carried out.|$|E
5000|$|Parking assist systems: {{when the}} driver engages reverse gear, the {{transmission}} control unit can send a signal via the CAN bus to activate both the parking sensor system, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>control</b> module for <b>the</b> passenger side <b>door</b> mirror to tilt downwards to show {{the position of the}} curb. The CAN bus also takes inputs from the rain sensor to trigger the rear windscreen wiper when reversing.|$|R
50|$|In June 2016 the RMT union {{announced}} that train guards {{would be going}} in strike {{several times during the}} summer months in protest of more driver only trains. An agreement was reached in September 2016, bringing an end to the dispute. It was agreed that the new Class 385 trains will have <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>controlled</b> by both <b>the</b> driver and guard, with the driver opening <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and <b>the</b> guard closing them.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Door</b> <b>Control</b> Unit is {{responsible}} for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles {{have more than one}} door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with <b>the</b> driver's <b>door</b> has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like locking, driver door switch pad, child lock switches, etc., which are associated with <b>the</b> driver's <b>door.</b> In most of <b>the</b> cases driver <b>door</b> module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} these recommendations, on March 3, 1974, {{less than two years}} after the near-loss of Flight 96, Turkish Airlines Flight 981 crashed outside Paris, killing all 346 {{passengers}} and crew on board for an identical rear cargo door failure. Unlike Flight 96, where the crew still managed to keep enough flight controls to safely return to Detroit, the pilots of Flight 981 lost complete control of the tail surfaces and all hydraulics. Investigators discovered that the upgrades had never been carried out on this airframe, although the construction logs claimed they had been. One modification had been carried out, the installation of the inspection window, along with a placard beside <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> printed in English and Turkish that informed the operators how to inspect the latches. The operator in Paris was Algerian and could not read either language, and had been instructed {{that as long as the}} locking handle closed, the door was safe. He also noted that he did not have to force the handle, and investigators concluded that it had already been bent on a prior flight.|$|E
50|$|With O Stock cars available, 73 sets of P stock {{were ordered}} for the Metropolitan line. Six and eight car trains were needed, so six car trains were made up from two three car units formed of two driving motor cars and a trailer and eight cars {{by adding a}} two car unit. The guard's {{position}} on the P Stock was at the inner ends of the motor cars, as the cabs on eight car trains could still be in tunnel at stations with short platforms. The O Stock units, with the guard position in the cab, were split up and motor cars placed in {{the centre of the}} six car trains so that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> in these cabs were not needed. Six P1 motor cars were built without door controls and ran in the same position. Although a train could be made up from O and P Stock cars, and the units had automatic couplers on the outer ends of the motor cars, the metadynes were not interchangeable. The first P Stock train entered service on 17 July 1939. Six-car O Stock trains operated on the Hammersmith & City service, and the mixed O and P Stock trains provided the services to Uxbridge.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Sorkin reveals to Gerry {{that she}} {{actually}} put her lysine deficiency cure into the park's main water supply {{instead of just}} the holding pens, which will eventually cure all the dinosaurs and eliminate Jurassic Park's lysine contingency entirely. As {{the two of them}} argue over the ethical implications of Dr. Sorkin's actions, Jess sneaks away with Sorkin's cigarettes, hoping to have a smoke. A Velociraptor attacks her, forcing her to flee back to Gerry and Sorkin, leading the rest of the raptor pack right to them. They fight the dinosaurs off {{with the help of a}} forklift until the others arrive, with Oscar driving the raptors away by wounding the pack leader with his knife. Soon after, steam jets begin escaping from the nearby valves. Dr. Sorkin explains that this means that the park's power plant is on the verge of an explosion, and will have to be reset manually before it goes off. Now regrouped, the survivors head to the power plant to reset the main grid. The group work together to get inside the plant, release the built-up steam pressure and reset the system, but in the process trigger a safety protocol that begins sealing the entire plant behind heavy metal blast doors. However, the raptors get in just before the doors can fully close, trapping the survivors inside with the dinosaurs. The group heads to the upper level to escape the raptors, but realize that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> on their level are burned out, meaning someone will have to go back down to the lower level and use the panel there. Oscar volunteers, and manages to hold off the raptors long enough to reopen the doors before being killed. The rest of the group runs into the boiler room and seal themselves in. However, once inside they find the body of a man covered in what looks like a nest. Yoder identifies him as DeCaf, alive but paralyzed and brain-dead from the same poison that affected Nima and Vargas, with dinosaur eggs laid in his abdomen. Sorkin reveals that she knew the creatures who did this had gotten loose, and Yoder, angry that she withheld this, grabs her and draws his knife, threatening to kill her.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} by the possible benefits of a more precise trawl control system with respect to both environmental impact and fishing efficiency. It considers how the control performance of a pelagic trawl system can be improved, partly by introducing a control architecture tailor-made for the trawl system subject to industrial requirements, and partly by developing a trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept. A mathematical model of the trawl system is developed, including an accurate model of the hydrodynamic forces on <b>the</b> trawl <b>doors.</b> This model estimates both the steady state and the transient forces on trawl doors moving in six degrees of freedom. The steady state hydrodynamic forces are based on wind tunnel experiments. To estimate the transient forces, a software code based on potential theory is developed. This software estimates the time-dependency of the forces from circulation about the foil, the angular damping forces, and the forces from relative accelerations between the fluid and <b>the</b> trawl <b>door.</b> Various concepts for trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> are evaluated. This is done both analytically, by simulations and by towing tank experiments. Based on the results, a new trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept is proposed. <b>The</b> trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept is developed to fulfill the demands on both energy consumption, robustness and control performance. Because of the contradictory demands on performance, stability and energy efficiency, the control concept is improved using numerical optimization. The optimization is based on timedomain simulations of the trawl system. The design of an overall trawl control architecture taking advantage of <b>the</b> trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> system is presented. This takes industrial constraints into account, such as the energy supply on <b>the</b> trawl <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>control</b> system is based on model predictive control and facilitates complex objectives, constraints and process models. The use of model predictive control is made possible by letting PID plant controllers act as a layer between the model predictive controller and the trawl system. The model predictive controller is thus able to operate on a stable and predictable system with no fast dynamics. To reduce the energy consumption of <b>the</b> trawl <b>door,</b> conventional feedback <b>control</b> is avoided on {{this part of the}} control system, and step wise feedforward control is instead employed. The main contributions in this work are the mathematical modeling of the hydrodynamic forces on a trawl <b>door,</b> <b>the</b> design of a control architecture tailor-made for trawl system control and the method for optimization of <b>the</b> trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

50|$|The Class 614 has <b>door</b> <b>control</b> with {{selective}} <b>door</b> {{opening and}} <b>door</b> sensory systems. <b>The</b> <b>doors,</b> which on <b>the</b> 624/634 {{were not always}} easy to open, are assisted by compressed air.

50|$|On 10 June 2006, 222 009 working 1D17 10:30 London to Sheffield had to {{be taken}} out of service due to a door being {{discovered}} open at Desborough, Northamptonshire whilst at speed. The RAIB report determined that the incident was probably caused by a sequence of events which {{would not have been possible}} with a traditional manually-operated mechanical door: a combination of a piece of dirt incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>door</b> lock switch during manufacture and a software bug in <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>control</b> system allowed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to remain unlocked after the train called at Luton, but prevented this condition being detected. Deflation and inflation of <b>the</b> pneumatic <b>door</b> seals, initiated automatically by detectors responding to the train stopping and starting at subsequent stations, then gradually prised <b>the</b> <b>door</b> out of its socket until at a point north of Kettering it became able to open. This condition was detected and an automatic brake application initiated, whereupon the inertial forces caused <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to slide open fully; however the indications presented in the driver's cab were ambiguous and were interpreted as caused by faulty systems, and he therefore cancelled the brake application. The train was finally halted at Desborough summit after a passenger reported that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was open.|$|R

50|$|When a {{credential}} {{is presented}} to a reader, the reader sends the credential‚Äôs information, usually a number, to a control panel, a highly reliable processor. The control panel compares the credential's number to an access control list, grants or denies the presented request, and sends a transaction log to a database. When access is denied based on the access <b>control</b> list, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> remains locked. If there is a match between the credential and the access control list, the control panel operates a relay that in turn unlocks <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> <b>control</b> panel also ignores a door open signal to prevent an alarm.

50|$|The lock is {{typically}} engaged via a small {{switch on the}} edge of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> that is only accessible when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is open.

30|$|Similar to {{the overall}} driver-related {{incident}} statistics, wrong-side door activations have been localised to the stations with designs deviating from the standardised design. It could be an unusual position of a signal, Victorian built environment at the legacy stations or other deviation. Furthermore, stations with a different platform side, compared to a previous station, demonstrated increased levels of such incidents. The drivers disagree that either change of the platform side or an unusual positioning of a signal affects their door-opening duties. They scored the attention lapse and distraction high {{as the most important}} potential causes for this type of incident. Difference in the layout of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>control</b> in different cars has been marked high too.
