50|$|Lava {{tubes are}} the most common and most {{extensive}} kind of lava cave. Lava tubes usually form in pahoehoe lava flows, though exceptions exist. As the lava is emitted from the vent area, it spreads in the path of least resistance. The outer layers of the lava harden, while the interior forms horizontal conduits that channel the advance of the flow. These conduits are the beginning stages of lava tubes that serve to insulate the heat from the lava which then provides a way for the lava flow to advance longer distances. Dependent upon the slope, terrain, and lava viscosity, different kinds of lava tubes can form. Multilateral tubes are those that form paralleling, often branching and anastomosing tubes. Multilevel tubes are those that sit directly on top or underneath another tube, sometimes above or below several tubes. Some lava flows hold a mixture of multilevel and multilateral tubes. One other form a lava tube is the <b>tube-in-tube</b> which can form inside lava tubes if the linings of the walls are weak enough to lean inward, forming a new floor above the old. Tube-in-tubes are generally noted to form during the last lava draining through the main lava tube.|$|E

40|$|Heat pump {{water heaters}} are a {{promising}} technology to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. A key component is the water heating heat exchanger. Two multi-zone {{models of the}} double-wall counter-current flow heat exchanger (condenser and gas cooler models) for residential air-source heat pump water heaters were developed. These models were validated against available data in the open literature. They predicted heat exchanger size within - 0. 8 % for a HFC- 134 a (with oil) condenser and within - 14 % for a CO 2 gas cooler. The multi-zone model was significantly more accurate than one and three zone models. The models for a R 410 A subcritical heat pump and a CO 2 transcritical heat pump were used to investigate the effect of key design parameters by varying water or refrigerant flow channel size for three water heating heat exchanger configurations: circular <b>tube-in-tube,</b> flat tube-on-tube, and twisted <b>tube-in-tube.</b> For the circular <b>tube-in-tube</b> configuration, refrigerant flow in the annulus (case B) performed better than refrigerant flow in the inner tube. The optimal flow channels for the circular <b>tube-in-tube</b> configuration case B with 0. 1 mm thick air gap in the double wall {{were found to be}} di (inside diameter of the 1 st tube) of 8 mm and annulus [Di (inside diameter of the 3 rd tube) -d 2 outside diameter of the 2 nd tube) ] of 1. 5 mm for R 410 A and di of 7 mm and Di âˆ’d 2 of 1. 0 mm for R 744. The optimal flow channels for the flat tube-on-tube configuration with b 1 i (major length of the refrigerant flow channel) and b 2 i (major length of the water flow channel) both of 9 mm were found to be a 1 i (minor length of the refrigerant flow channel) and a 2 i (minor length of the water flow channel) of 1. 5 mm for R 410 A and a 1 i of 1 mm and a 2 i of 1. 5 mm for R 744. The optimal flow channels for the twisted <b>tube-in-tube</b> configuration were found to be di of 7. 94 mm and d 1 (original inside diameter of twisted tube) of 12. 7 mm for R 410 A and di of 6. 35 mm and d 1 of 9. 525 mm for R 744. At the optimal flow channel size in each configuration, heat exchanger weight of the flat tube-on-tube was lower than the circular <b>tube-in-tube</b> by about 34. 4 % for R 410 A and by about 66. 6 % for R 744. This was mainly due to elimination of the air gap resistance with the tube-on-tube configuration. Heat exchanger length, weight, and pumping power of the twisted <b>tube-in-tube</b> with 94 % contact were significantly lower than the flat tube-on-tube by about 85 %, 62 %, and 97 % respectively for R 410 A and by about 65 %, 35. 7 %, and 98 % respectively for R 744. Overall, the flat tube-on-tube and the twisted <b>tube-in-tube</b> configurations are most promising for the water heating heat exchanger in terms of the lowest investment and running costs respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of obtaining local wall temperatures by using liquid crystal thermography (LCT) in a counter-flow <b>tube-in-tube</b> heat exchanger was investigated. Local annulus-side heat transfer coefficients at the inlet and thermodynamically and hydrodynamically underdeveloped regions were also obtained while operating at steady conditions. The heat transfer coefficients of the <b>tube-in-tube</b> heat exchanger are, however, disputed in the literature, as conflicting sources are easily found. In most literature sources {{the problem is}} simplified by assuming constant heat transfer coefficients throughout {{the length of the}} heat exchanger and the boundary layer growth is generally ignored at inlet regions. Thermocouples pose practical problems when measuring temperatures in heat exchangers. LCT is investigated as alternative surface temperature measurement technique. This study aims to develop a methodology for directly measuring wall temperatures inside a <b>tube-in-tube</b> heat exchanger. These temperatures were further used to calculate local heat transfer coefficients. In this study, a 1 m long <b>tube-in-tube</b> test section with an annulus diameter ratio of 0. 54 (ratio of the inner wall of the annulus to its outer wall) was constructed, in which liquid crystal thermography was employed as an alternative wall temperature measurement technique to thermocouples. Temperature-sensitive paint was applied to the inner wall of the annulus in order to measure the wall temperatures non-intrusively. Complete temperature maps could be constructed for different thermal conditions which indicated differences of up to 10 Â°C in wall temperature at the inlet regions, which would have been difficult to capture with thermocouples. This study covered a total of nine different annular flow and thermal conditions for cooled and heated cases. The annular flow conditions ranged from laminar (Re = 1000) flow to fully turbulent flow (Re = 13 800). In general, the heat transfer coefficients were found not to be constant {{along the length of the}} heat exchanger. The averaged heat transfer coefficients at the inlet were compared with existing correlations in the literature for full-length heat exchangers and were found to be higher by an average of 44 % over the data presented. Uncertainties on the local heat transfer coefficient were found to be approximately 80 % for the cooled annulus cases and 45 % for a heated annulus. This was mostly due to the practical laboratory restrictions imposed by fluid temperature limits. It was found that liquid crystal thermography could be used successfully for directly measuring the wall temperatures of <b>tube-in-tube</b> heat exchangers with very low surface temperature uncertainties (0. 03 Â°C). With the approach developed in this study, a method was found for determining local heat transfer coefficients without introducing wall thermocouples or any other disturbances in the passage of the annular fluid.

The semipermeable tube was packed with 1 wt % Auâ€“Pd/TiO 2 catalyst particles and placed inside a PTFE tube to provide an annular region which was pressurized with pure oxygen.
