40|$|Tung’s fruits (Aleurites fordii) produce oil {{of great}} {{applicability}} {{in the market}} of painting and covering due to its drying characteristics. <b>Tung’s</b> <b>oil</b> may be an alternative {{for the production of}} new biofuels. In this study, it was evaluated the energetic potential of the fruit, oil and biodiesel obtained from the Tung. The average yielding of the extracted seed oil was 50. 6 %, a value similar to those presented in literature. Moreover, its density presented a value of 931. 5 g L- 1 and its acid index, 4. 5 mg KOH g- 1. In the last step of this study, biodiesel was produced by basic methyl route using potassium hydroxide. The specific mass of the produced biodiesel was 909. 2 kg m- 3 at 20 °C; its acid index was 0. 473 mg KOH g- 1 and its flash point was 178 °C. The values of heating values in natura and the low level of ashes in the residual biomass makes the Tung’s fruits a promising renewable clean source of energy of second generation fuel...|$|R

50|$|Because {{the major}} {{components}} of an alkyd coating, i.e. fatty acids and triglyceride oils, {{are derived from}} low cost renewable resources, this has kept the cost of alkyd coatings very low despite ever increasing cost of petroleum, which is the predominant raw material source of most other coatings such as vinyls, acrylics, epoxies, and polyurethanes. Typical sources of drying oils for alkyd coatings are: linseed, <b>tung,</b> sunflower <b>oil,</b> safflower oil, walnut oil, soybean oil, fish oil, corn oil, DCO. (made by dehydrating castor oil, which creates a semi drying, conjugated, oil/fatty acid), and tall oil (resinous oil by-product from pulp and paper manufacturing). Non drying/ plasticizer resins are made from castor, palm, coconut oils and cardura (a synthetic fatty, versatic acid).

40|$|In this dissertation, {{results are}} {{presented}} of laboratory investigations and mathematical modeling efforts designed {{to better understand the}} interactions of ozone with surfaces. In the laboratory, carpet and duct materials were exposed to ozone and measured ozone uptake kinetics and the ozone induced emissions of volatile organic compounds. To understand the results of the experiments, mathematical methods were developed to describe dynamic indoor aldehyde concentrations, mass transport of reactive species to smooth surfaces, the equivalent reaction probability of whole carpet due to the surface reactivity of fibers and carpet backing, and ozone aging of surfaces. Carpets, separated carpet fibers, and separated carpet backing all tended to release aldehydes when exposed to ozone. Secondary emissions were mostly n-nonanal and several other smaller aldehydes. The pattern of emissions suggested that vegetable oils may be precursors for these oxidized emissions. Several possible precursors and experiments in which linseed and <b>tung</b> <b>oils</b> were tested for their secondary emission potential were discussed. Dynamic emission rates of 2 -nonenal from a residential carpet may indicate that intermediate species in the oxidation of conjugated olefins can significantly delay aldehyde emissions and act as reservoir for these compounds. The ozone induced emission rate of 2 -nonenal, a very odorous compound, can result in odorous indoor concentrations for several years. Surface ozone reactivity is a key parameter in determining the flux of ozone to a surface, is parameterized by the reaction probability, which is simply the probability that an ozone molecule will be irreversibly consumed when it strikes a surface. In laboratory studies of two residential and two commercial carpets, the ozone reaction probability for carpet fibers, carpet backing and the equivalent reaction probability for whole carpet were determined. Typically reaction probability values for these materials were 10 {sup {minus} 7 }, 10 {sup {minus} 5 }, and 10 {sup {minus} 5 } respectively. To understand how internal surface area influences the equivalent reaction probability of whole carpet, a model of ozone diffusion into and reaction with internal carpet components was developed. This was then used to predict apparent reaction probabilities for carpet. He combines this with a modified model of turbulent mass transfer developed by Liu, et al. to predict deposition rates and indoor ozone concentrations. The model predicts that carpet should have an equivalent reaction probability of about 10 {sup {minus} 5 }, matching laboratory measurements of the reaction probability. For both carpet and duct materials, surfaces become progressively quenched (aging), losing the ability to react or otherwise take up ozone. He evaluated the functional form of aging and find that the reaction probability follows a power function with respect to the cumulative uptake of ozone. To understand ozone aging of surfaces, he developed several mathematical descriptions of aging based on two different mechanisms. The observed functional form of aging is mimicked by a model which describes ozone diffusion with internal reaction in a solid. He shows that the fleecy nature of carpet materials in combination with the model of ozone diffusion below a fiber surface and internal reaction may explain the functional form and the magnitude of power function parameters observed due to ozone interactions with carpet. The ozone induced aldehyde emissions, measured from duct materials, were combined with an indoor air quality model to show that concentrations of aldehydes indoors may approach odorous levels. He shows that ducts are unlikely to be a significant sink for ozone due to the low reaction probability in combination with the short residence time of air in ducts...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> or China {{wood oil}} is a drying oil {{obtained}} by pressing the seed from the nut of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii). <b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> hardens upon exposure to air, {{and the resulting}} coating is transparent and has a deep, almost wet look. Used mostly for finishing/protecting wood, after numerous coats the finish can even look plastic-like. Related drying oils include linseed, safflower, poppy and soybean oils. The oil and its use {{are believed to have}} originated in ancient China and appear in the writings of Confucius from about 400 B.C.Raw <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> tends to dry to a fine wrinkled finish; the US name for this is gas checking: this property was used to make wrinkle finishes, usually by adding excess cobalt drier. To stop this, the oil is heated to gas-proof it, and most oils used for coating are gas-proofed.

5000|$|<b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> is {{very popular}} today because of 2 properties: First it is natural or [...] "green" [...] product when it has dried.

The oil is often diluted with hydrocarbon thinner so that the viscosity is very low and enables the oil to penetrate the finest grain woods. This thinning vehicle evaporates within 15 to 20 minutes and results in a totally green residual finish.
