5|$|Abebe {{returned}} to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard.|$|E
5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was the lifting of heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of}} the city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{of the two}} armies {{initially}} collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated {{his forces}} there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> the town to the hills just to the south.|$|E
50|$|Plague is an 1898 {{painting}} in tempera by the Swiss symbolist artist Arnold Böcklin, {{held in the}} Kunstmuseum Basel.

The battalion's voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the SS Stratheden.

He was soon in more trouble, and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident.|$|E
5|$|Just {{one week}} after the MEF had taken over Anbar, insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy {{carrying}} four American mercenaries from Blackwater USA on 31 March, killing all of them. An angry mob then set the mercenaries' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. The American media compared the attack on the mercenaries to the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, where images of American soldiers being dragged <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Somalia prompted the United States to withdraw its troops.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United had {{originally}} intended to hold a parade <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Manchester to celebrate their Double triumph on their return from Moscow on 22 May.

5|$|Pennethorne's gallery was {{demolished}} for {{the next}} phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by Frederic, Lord Leighton’s painting of Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets</b> <b>of</b> Florence (1853–55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Santa Rosalía de Palermo – born in Palermo, Italy – is {{the patron}} saint of El Hatillo.

Within three days, the plague ended; Rosalía was credited with saving many from the plague and proclaimed patron saint of the city.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the four}} attackers fled on foot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Bayonne.

Those apprehended were Pierre Frugoli and Lucien Mattei, both believed to be members of the Marseilles underworld by French police. Police later retrieved two 9mm calibre pistols from the river. Their two accomplices in the attack managed to escape by car. Their vehicle was later found abandoned in San Sebastián.|$|E

5|$|To {{mark their}} victory, the Allied troops marched in triumph <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Buenos Aires. The parades {{included}} the Brazilian Army, which insisted that their triumphal procession {{take place on}} 20 February, to mark payback for the defeat it had suffered at the Battle of Ituzaingó twenty five years before on that date.

The parade concluded with Eli Gold as the master of ceremonies for an event on the Walk of Champions at Bryant–Denny Stadium that honored the 2012 team. On April 16, the team made their trip to the White House, where President Barack Obama offered congratulatory remarks for their championship season. As part of the A-Day celebrations on April 20, the 2012 team captains Barret Jones, Damion Square and Chance Warmack were honored at the Walk of Fame ceremony at the base of Denny Chimes.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Hang 'Em High, Eastwood had already begun working on Coogan's Bluff, about an Arizona deputy sheriff {{tracking}} a wanted psychopathic criminal (Don Stroud) <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1million—more than double his previous salary. Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel, a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last {{more than ten years}} and produce five films. Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized. The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence. Coogan's Bluff also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin, who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Dirty Harry films.|$|E

5|$|Detailed {{training}} {{began at}} Campbellfield shortly after concentration and in May the battalion marched <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Melbourne, before being presented with its unit colour. They were subsequently laid up at St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne prior to embarkation. They departed Australia on the transport Wandilla on 6 June 1916, and endured a seven-week voyage to the United Kingdom, sailing via Cape Town. After {{arriving in the}} United Kingdom, the battalion subsequently concentrated {{with the rest of}} the 3rd Division around Larkhill on Salisbury Plain, in Wiltshire. Between July and November 1916, the 3rd Pioneers carried out intensive training to prepare them for their arrival on the Western Front. Finally, on 25 November the battalion entrained at Amesbury bound for Southampton from where they were ferried across the English Channel to Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Saigon, depicted with bags {{of money on}} his shoulders, {{a deck of cards}} in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E
5|$|Having just {{completed}} one such patrol in May 1976, {{the ship was}} notified {{that she would be}} participating in an International Naval Review in New York City as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations, the first South African warship to visit the United States. President Kruger departed Simon's Town on 3 June, sailing via Walvis Bay, Abidjan and Las Palmas to Norfolk, Virginia. From there, she sailed in a fleet of 53 warships from 22 countries to New York City for the Naval Review on 4 July. On 6 July, members of the ship's company paraded <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> New York, after which she sailed home to Simonstown via Charleston, South Carolina and Las Palmas. The future politician, Lance Corporal Tony Leon, was the official photographer for this journey.|$|E
