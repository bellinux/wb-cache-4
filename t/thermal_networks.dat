40|$|An {{improved}} {{approach to}} the mathematical modeling of feedback control of <b>thermal</b> <b>networks</b> has been devised. Heretofore software for feedback control of <b>thermal</b> <b>networks</b> has been developed by time-consuming trial-and-error methods that depend on engineers expertise. In contrast, the present approach is a systematic means of developing algorithms for feedback control that is optimal {{in the sense that}} it combines performance with low cost of implementation. An additional advantage of the present approach is that a thermal engineer need not be expert in control theory. <b>Thermal</b> <b>networks</b> are lumped-parameter approximations used to represent complex thermal systems. <b>Thermal</b> <b>networks</b> are closely related to electrical networks commonly represented by lumped-parameter circuit diagrams. Like such electrical circuits, <b>thermal</b> <b>networks</b> are mathematically modeled by systems of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) that is, ordinary differential equations subject to a set of algebraic constraints. In the present approach, emphasis is placed on applications in which <b>thermal</b> <b>networks</b> are subject to constant disturbances and, therefore, integral control action is necessary to obtain steady-state responses. The mathematical development of the present approach begins with the derivation of optimal integral-control laws via minimization of an appropriate cost functional that involves augmented state vectors. Subsequently, classical variational arguments provide optimality conditions in the form of the Hamiltonian equations for the standard linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR) problem. These equations are reduced to an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) with respect to the augmented state vector. The solution of the ARE leads to the direct computation of the optimal proportional- and integral-feedback control gains. In cases of very complex networks, large numbers of state variables make it difficult to implement optimal controllers in the manner described in the preceding paragraph...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThermal {{actuators}} are extensively used in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Heat transfer {{through and}} around these microstructures are very complex. Knowing and controlling {{them in order}} to improve the performance of the micro-actuator, is currently a great challenge.

The three subsystems are coupled through thermo-electric, electric circuit-device, and thermal network-device interface conditions.
