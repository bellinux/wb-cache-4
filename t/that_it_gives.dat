5|$|The one-sided {{relationship}} has been discussed in many books. Some question the accuracy of Kubizek's memoir, the only source for the story.

5|$|Works by {{winners and}} nominees of the Campbell Award were {{collected}} in the New Voices series of anthologies, edited by George R. R. Martin, which had five volumes covering the awards from 1973 through 1977 and which were published between 1977 and 1984. Campbell nominees and winners, such as Michael A. Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> credibility with established authors and publishers. Criticism has been raised about the Campbell that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|The game's design also {{received}} acclaim. Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players {{with a sense of}} accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E

A similar-condition used ball is also used if {{the ball is}} ever lost {{in the course of}} play (for example, if a ball hit for six becomes irretrievable).|$|E
25|$|Opponents of zero {{tolerance}} {{believe that such}} a policy neglects investigation {{on a case-by-case basis}} and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes that may not warrant such penalties in reality. Another criticism of zero-tolerance policies is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> officers and the legal system little discretion in dealing with offenders. Zero-tolerance policies may prohibit their enforcers from making the punishment fit the crime.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} of marriage is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the state an undue {{power and control}} over the private lives of the citizens. The statutes governing marriage are drafted by the state, and not by the couples who marry under those laws. The laws may, at any time, be changed by the state without the consent (or even knowledge) of the married people. The terms derived from the principles of institutionalized marriage represent {{the interests of the}} governments.|$|E

25|$|The first model, {{based on}} a disk, has the {{advantage}} that geodesics are actually line segments (that is, intersections of Euclidean lines with the open unit disk).The last model has the advantage <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> a construction which is completely parallel {{to that of the}} unit sphere in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Because of their application in complex analysis and geometry, however, the models of Poincaré are the most widely used: they are interchangeable thanks to the Möbius transformations between the disk and the upper half-plane.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{a general}} {{movement}} toward rigor in mathematics in the nineteenth century, mathematicians attempted to put integral calculus on a firm foundation. The Riemann integral—proposed by Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866)—is a broadly successful attempt to provide such a foundation. Riemann's definition starts with the construction of a sequence of easily calculated areas that converge to the integral of a given function. This definition is successful in the sense <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the expected answer for many already-solved problems, and gives useful results for many other problems.|$|E
25|$|Implants, as {{subcutaneous}} pellets, {{can be used}} {{to deliver}} testosterone (brand name Testopel). 6 to 12 pellets are inserted under the skin every three months. This must be done in a physician's office, but is a relatively minor procedure done under local anesthetic. Pellets cost about $60 each, so the cost is greater than injected testosterone when the cost of the physician visit and procedure are included. The primary advantages of Testopel are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> a much more constant blood level of testosterone yet requires attention only four times yearly.|$|E

Once the player decides to progress to the next stage, the creature editor appears, prompting the user to add legs before the shift to land. The Creature editor differs in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the player {{the ability to make}} major changes to the creature's body shape and length, and place parts in three-dimensional space instead of a top-down view as in the Cell editor.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, 2012, the Competitive Enterprise Institute {{joined the}} State National Bank of Big Spring, Texas, and the 60 Plus Association as plaintiffs {{in a lawsuit}} filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, {{challenging}} the constitutionality of provisions of Dodd–Frank. The complaint {{asked the court to}} invalidate the law, arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the federal government unprecedented, unchecked power. The lawsuit was amended on September 20, 2012, to include the states of Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Michigan as plaintiffs. The states asked the court to review the constitutionality of the Orderly Liquidation Authority established under Title II of Dodd–Frank.|$|E
25|$|While Einstein's {{result is}} the same as Bradley's {{original}} equation except for an extra factor of , it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, in the sense <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.|$|E

25|$|Another, easier {{equation}} {{that can}} be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Morton Smith {{published}} a book on a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria. He stated that, while cataloging documents at the ancient Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba {{in the summer of}} 1958, he discovered the text of the letter handwritten into the endpapers of Isaac Vossius' 1646 printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. It presented a letter of Clement of Alexandria to one Theodore, whom he seeks to warn against a Gospel of Mark falsified by the gnostic sect of Carpocratians. Clement concedes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> a 'more spiritual' version of Mark and quotes from it. This letter is consequently referred to as the Mar Saba letter. In his book, Smith {{published a}} set of black-and-white photographs of the text. He published a second book for the popular audience in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Quantitative {{computed}} tomography differs from DXA in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg/cm3 rather than BMD's relative Z score. Among QCT's advantages: {{it can be}} performed at axial and peripheral sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is sensitive to change over time, can analyze a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, and air, and does not require knowledge of the patient's subpopulation {{in order to create}} a clinical score (e.g. the Z-score of all females of a certain age). Among QCT's disadvantages: it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results are more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT.|$|E

25|$|Critics of Social Security claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> a {{low rate}} of return, {{compared}} to what is obtained through private retirement accounts. For example, critics point out that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed {{to opt out of}} the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996. While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a GAO report to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.|$|E
