5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating <b>there</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E
5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from <b>there</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E

25|$|By {{the twentieth}} century Frenchtown had its own stores, doctors, pharmacy, schools, restaurants, nightclubs, and (on Tennessee Street) a movie theater. When James Baldwin visited to read some of his work at FAMU, he stayed at (and could only stay at) the Tookes Hotel. Frenchtown was {{a stop on the}} Chitlin' Circuit, and famous black musicians like Louis Armstrong, B. B.

25|$|The worst raid {{took place}} in the night of 10/11May 1941, when the Palace took at least twelve hits and three people (two policemen and the Resident Superintendent of the House of Lords, Edward Elliott) were killed. An {{incendiary}} bomb hit the chamber of the House of Commons and set it on fire; another set the roof of Westminster Hall alight. The firefighters could not save both, and a decision was taken to try to rescue the Hall. In this they were successful; the abandoned Commons Chamber, on the other hand, was destroyed, as was the Members' Lobby. A bomb also struck the Lords Chamber, but went through the floor without exploding. The Clock Tower took a hit by a small bomb or anti-aircraft shell at the eaves of the roof, suffering much damage <b>there.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> glass on the south dial was blown out, but the hands and bells were not affected, and the Great Clock continued to keep time accurately.|$|E

500|$|The Skagen {{painters}} quickly {{began to}} form a close-knit community as relationships grew between the artists and the young women from the area. In 1880, Michael Ancher married Anna Brøndum from the guest house, Viggo Johansen married Martha Møller, Anna's cousin, and Karl Madsen married Helene Christensen, a schoolteacher. The house the Anchers moved into in 1884 became a focus for the artists' colony, especially as the couple lived <b>there</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> year round. When their daughter Helga (the little girl in Hip, Hip, Hurrah!) died in 1964, she left the house to a foundation which soon {{turned it into a}} museum.

500|$|Back on Earth, the Master Chief {{helps to}} repel hostile Covenant forces from Mombasa, Kenya and Voi. With the Arbiter (a Covenant Elite who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads {{the assault on}} a Forerunner {{artifact}} that the Covenant Prophet of Truth is attempting to activate. Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact, the Flood lands on Earth. After helping to control the infestation, the Master Chief follows Truth to the Ark, an immense constructed world more than 262,144light-years {{from the center of}} the Milky Way galaxy and well beyond the range of any Halo. <b>There,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Halos can be remotely activated, thus killing all sentient life that could be infested by the Flood. It is discovered that a new Halo is being constructed to replace the one that the Master Chief destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark, bringing High Charity through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos. The allied Elites and humans decide to activate the new Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the Dawn in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, [...] "Wake me, when you need me."

Bush, who has lost the 2004 election, has returned to Texas which has seceded from the United States, {{along with the rest}} of the southern United States, reforming the Confederate States of America, resulting in a second Civil War. Brian insists that things will still be better in the end, but when they travel five years into the future they find a computer generated post-apocalyptic future caused by nuclear attacks all across the United States which results in the deaths of over 17 million people (including Cesar Millan much to Brian's horror). Admitting that he made a mistake, Brian asks how the situation can be resolved. The two then return to prevent Brian from telling his past self about the attacks. They then return to the present, whereupon Stewie learns that Brian has taken false credit for the Harry Potter series. Seeing that Brian has learned nothing from his warnings, Stewie says they have to repair this by again trying to prevent themselves from telling any future events. This causes hundreds of Stewies and Brians to appear, however, to prevent them from telling the future. This number includes one Brian and Stewie with their Peter who says he [...] "just came for the can", another Brian and Stewie trapped in barber shop twirls, one Brian and Stewie dressed up in their banana outfits, and a Stewie who arrives with his Brian whose throat is slit. Having had enough of this, one Stewie tells all of his and his Brian's numerous future selves to decide whether or not to prevent 9/11, which results in the majority saying no, not to for tell any future events, and to return to their time and stay <b>there.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> Brians and Stewies do it as they are told. From there, Stewie takes Brian back a minute before their past selves arrive and forces them at gunpoint to return to their time. After initial confusion resulting with the Brian that just arrived being shot in the leg, they comply. With that, the altered timeline ceases to exist along with its corresponding Stewie and Brian.|$|E
