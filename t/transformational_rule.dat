5000|$|In {{the third}} chapter titled [...] "An Elementary Linguistic Theory", Chomsky tries to {{determine}} what sort of device or model gives an adequate account of a given set of [...] "grammatical" [...] sentences. Chomsky hypothesizes that this device has to be finite instead of infinite. He then considers finite state grammar, a communication theoretic model which treats language as a Markov process. Then in the fourth chapter titled [...] "Phrase Structure", he discusses phrase structure grammar, a model based on immediate constituent analysis. In the fifth chapter titled [...] "Limitations of Phrase Structure Description", he claims to show that both these models are inadequate {{for the purpose of}} linguistic description. As a solution, he introduces transformational generative grammar (TGG), [...] "a more powerful model ... that might remedy these inadequacies."Chomsky's transformational grammar has three parts: phrase structure rules, transformational rules and morphophonemic rules. The phrase structure rules are used for expanding grammatical categories and for substitutions. These yield a string of morphemes. A <b>transformational</b> <b>rule</b> [...] "operates on a given string ... with a given constituent structure and converts it into a new string with a new derived constituent structure." [...] It [...] "may rearrange strings or may add or delete morphemes." [...] Transformational rules are of two kinds: obligatory or optional. Obligatory transformations applied on the [...] "terminal strings" [...] of the grammar produce the [...] "kernel of the language". Kernel sentences are simple, active, declarative and affirmative sentences. To produce passive, negative, interrogative or complex sentences, one or more optional transformation rules must be applied in a particular order to the kernel sentences. At the final stage of the grammar, morphophonemic rules convert a string of words into a string of phonemes. Chomsky then applies this idea of transformational rules in the English auxiliary verb system.|$|E

40|$|Generation of English {{sentence}} is {{realized in the}} following three steps. First, the generation of kernel sentence by phrase structure rules; second, the application of <b>transformational</b> <b>rules</b> to the kernel sentence; and finally {{the completion of a}} sentence by the morphophonemic modifications. At the first stage of generating kernel sentence, the semantics of words are fully utilized. The method is such that a pair of words in the generat- ion process (subject noun and predicate verb, verb and object or complement, adjective and modified noun etc.) is selected in accordance with the seman- tic categories which are attached to each word in the word dictionary. The semantic categories are determined by considering both the meaning of words themselves and also the functioning of words in sentences. At the stage of <b>transformational</b> <b>rules,</b> {{sentence is}} considered not as a simple string but as the one having the internal tree structure, and the <b>transformational</b> <b>rules</b> are applied to this tree structure. For these two stages the generation process is formalized strictly and is realized in a computer programming. We have presented in relation to the <b>transformational</b> <b>rules</b> a method of sentence generation not from the axiom (from the top Of the tree) but from any point, from which the whole tree is constructed. We have also proposed that the morphophonemic rules can be presented as a kind of operators operating on words in the neighbourhood of a generated string...|$|R

In light of WeXML(oil&gas well XML data) semantic integration and query requirement, this paper proposes a semantic integration method based on extraction rules and ontology mapping. The method firstly defines a series of extraction rules with which elements and properties of WeXML Schema are mapped to classes and properties in WeOWL ontology, respectively; secondly, an algorithm is used to transform WeXML documents into WeOWL instances. Because WeOWL provides limited semantics, ontology mappings between two ontologies are then built to explain class and property of global ontology with terms of WeOWL, and semantic query based on global domain concepts model is provided.

40|$|We {{find the}} rules of the {{conformal}} transformation for the energetic quantities such as the Einstein energy-momentum complex, the Bergmann-Thomson angular momentum complex, the superenergy tensor, and the angular supermomentum tensor of gravitation and matter. We show that the conformal transformation rules for the matter parts of both the Einstein complex and the Bergmann-Thomson complex are fairly simple, while the transformation rules for their gravitational parts are more complicated. We also find that the transformational rules of the superenergy tensor of matter and the superenergy tensor of gravity are quite complicated except for the case of a pure gravity. In such a special case the superenergy density as well as the sum of the superenergy density and the matter energy density are invariants of the conformal transformation. Besides, in that case, a conformal invariant is also the Bel-Robinson tensor which {{is a part of the}} superenergy tensor. As for the angular supermomentum tensor of gravity - it emerges that its <b>transformational</b> <b>rule</b> even for a pure gravity is quite complicated but this is not the case for the angular supermomentum tensor of matter.

40|$|In {{software}} engineering, {{a scenario}} describes an anticipated usage of a software system. As scenarios are useful {{to understand the}} requirements and functionalities of a software system, the scenario-based analysis is widely used in various tasks, especially in the design stage of software architectures. Although researchers have proposed various scenario-based approaches to analyse software architecture, there are still limitations in this research field, and a key limitation is that scenarios are typically not formally defined and thus may contain ambiguities. As these ambiguities may lead to defects, it is desirable to reduce them as many as possible. In order to reduce ambiguity in scenario-based software architecture analysis, this paper introduces a creative computing approach to scenario-based software requirements analysis. Our work expands this idea in three directions. Firstly, we extend an architecture description language (ADL) -based language–Breeze/ADL to model the software architecture. Secondly, we use a creative rule–combinational rule (CR) to combine the vector clock algorithm for reducing the ambiguities in modelling scenarios. Then, another creative rule – <b>transformational</b> <b>rule</b> (TR) is employed to help to transform our Breeze/ADL model to a popular model – unified modelling language (UML) model. We implement our approach as a plugin of Breeze, and illustrate a running example of modelling a poetry to music system in our case study. Our results show the proposed creative approach is able to reduce ambiguities of the software architecture in practice...|$|E

Instead an empty operator raises from the relative clause internal position to the initial position of the relative clause, and mediates the semantic relationship between the relative clause internal position and the head.

40|$|This study delves {{into the}} {{syntactic}} notion of subject relation in Shona {{with the aim}} of characterizing and defining it. This is done through analysing data collected from two of the Shona speaking provinces in Zimbabwe, namely, Harare and Masvingo.

The data were then analysed using the projection principle, noun phrase movement <b>transformational</b> <b>rule</b> as well as the selectional principles established for the subject relation in the other well researched natural languages. The research found out that there is no one single rule {{that can be used to}} determine the subject of every possible Shona sentence. One has to make use of all the seven selectional principles established in the well-researched natural languages. The research managed to assess the applicability of the selectional rules in different sentences. The rules were then ranked according to their reliability in determining the subjects of each of the various Shona sentences. It also came to light that the Shona subject relation has a number of sub-categories as a result of the various selectional rules involved in determining them. These were also ranked in a hierarchy of importance as they apply in the language. For instance, whilst some are assigned to their host words at the deep structure or underlying level of syntax, some are assigned at the surface structure level and can be shifted easily. It also emerged that the freedom of the subject relation in the language varies with the sub-category of the relation. It came to light as well that in Shona both noun phrases (NPs) and non-NPs are assigned the subject role. African LanguagesD. Litt. et Phil. (African Languages...|$|E
40|$|Research in both {{stimulus-response}} compatibility {{and negative}} priming seeks {{to understand the}} control mechanisms involved in response-selection processes. Stimulus-response compatibility refers to the finding that reaction times are faster when the stimuli and responses correspond than when they do not. In a typical negative priming task, two successive trials are examined. Negative priming refers to the finding that reaction times are longer when the current (probe) trial 2 ̆ 7 s target served as an irrelevant distractor stimulus on the previous (prime) trial, compared to a neutral trial for which the probe target is unrelated to prime trial events. This longer reaction time {{is believed to be}} a direct measure of inhibitory effects from the prime trial. ^ Shiu and Kornblum (1996) demonstrated negative priming without distractors in an incongruent symbolic task with verbal responses, in which they alternated pictures with words. Reaction times were longer when the stimulus identity (incorrect corresponding response) on the prime trial became the probe target response. Shiu and Kornblum intrepreted this “negative priming” effect as reflecting inhibition of the corresponding (automatic) response from the prime trial. Read and Proctor (2004) replicated Shiu and Kornblum 2 ̆ 7 s finding using an analogous spatial task with keypress responses. However, when the mapping was changed, such that subjects could adopt a simple <b>transformational</b> <b>rule,</b> positive priming occurred. ^ Six experiments are reported that extend Read and Proctor 2 ̆ 7 s research by examining the conditions under which negative priming occurs in comparable spatial and symbolic tasks. Experiments 1 and 2 were similar to Read and Proctor 2 ̆ 7 s Experiments 1 and 2, but used word stimuli and verbal responses instead of spatial locations and keypress responses. The results were similar to those with the spatial tasks. Experiments 3 through 6 explored inhibition and facilitation for these symbolic and spatial tasks in a variation of the negative priming task. Based on past research, facilitation and inhibition were inferred through the temporal dynamics of different trial types. Results support a residual inhibition account, as proposed by Shiu and Kornblum for negative priming effects. However, the results also suggest that inhibition of the corresponding response depends on subjective expectancy, task complexity, and task goals. ...|$|E
