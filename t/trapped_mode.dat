5000|$|As {{an example}} calculation, let the phase shift &delta;=0, {{which would be}} close to the case for the TM01 mode by design and {{unfortunately}} likely to occur for a few HOM's. Having &delta;=0 (or an integer multiple of an RF mode's period, &delta;=n2&pi;) gives the worse-case wakefield build-up, where successive bunches are maximally decelerated by previous bunches' wakefields and give up even more energy than with only their [...] "self wake". Then, taking &omega; = 2&pi; 500 MHz, Tb=1 µs, and QL=106, the buildup of wakefields would be Vss wake=637×Vwake. A pitfall for any accelerator cavity would be the presence of what is termed a [...] "trapped mode". This is an HOM that does not leak out of the cavity and consequently has a QL that can be orders of magnitude larger than used in this example. In this case, the buildup of wakefields of the <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> would likely cause a beam instability. The beam instability implications due to the Vss wake wakefields is thus addressed differently for the fundamental accelerating mode TM01 and all other RF modes, as described next.|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the classical theory of linearised water waves in unbounded domains, trapped modes consist of non-propagating, localised oscillation modes of finite energy occurring at some well-defined frequency and which, in the absence of dissipation, persist in time {{even in the absence of}} external forcing. Jones (1953) proved the existence of trapped modes for problems governed by the Helmholtz equation in semi-infinite domains. Trapped modes have been studied in quantum mechanics, elasticity and acoustics and are known, depending on the context, as bound states, acoustic resonances, Rayleigh-Bloch waves, sloshing modes and motion trapped modes. We consider trapped modes in two dimensional infinite waveguides with either Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. Such problems arise when considering obstacles in acoustic waveguides or bound states in quantum wires for example. The mathematical model is a boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation. Under the usual assumptions of potential theory, the solution is written in terms of a boundary integral equation. We develop a Boundary Element Method (BEM) program which we use to obtain approximate numerical solutions. We extend existing results by identifying additional trapped modes for geometries already studied and investigate new structures. We also carry out a detailed investigation of trapped modes, using the planewave spectrum representation developed for various characteristic problems from the classical theories of radiation, diffraction and propagation. We use simple planewaves travelling in diverse directions to build a more elaborate solution, which satisfies certain conditions required for a <b>trapped</b> <b>mode.</b> Our approach is fairly flexible so that the general procedure is independent of the shape of the trapping obstacle and could be adapted to other geometries. We apply this method to the case of a disc on the centreline of an infinite Dirichlet acoustic waveguide and obtain a simple mathematical approximation of a <b>trapped</b> <b>mode,</b> which satisfies a set of criteria characteristic of trapped modes. Asymptotically, the solution obtained is similar to a nearly <b>trapped</b> <b>mode,</b> which is a perturbation of a genuine <b>trapped</b> <b>mode.</b> Imperial Users onl...|$|E

The scattering of waves by a finite thin plate in a two-dimensional wave guide {{and an array of}} finite thin plates, in the presence of subsonic mean flow, are formulated using a mode matching technique.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of Fluid Mechanics [© Cambridge University Press] and is available at: [URL] numerical and analytical investigation is made into the response of a fluid when a two-dimensional structure is forced to move in a prescribed fashion. The structure is constructed {{in such a way that}} it supports a <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> at one particular frequency. The fluid motion is assumed to be small and the time-domain equations for linear water-wave theory are solved numerically. In addition, the asymptotic behaviour of the resulting velocity potential is determined analytically from the relationship between the time- and frequency-domain solutions. The trapping structure has two distinct surface-piercing elements and the <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> exhibits a vertical ‘pumping’ motion of the fluid between the elements. When the structure is forced to oscillate at the trapped-mode frequency an oscillation which grows in time but decays in space is observed. An oscillatory forcing at a frequency different from that of the <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> produces bounded oscillations at both the forcing and the trappedmode frequency. A transient forcing also gives rise to a localized oscillation at the trapped-mode frequency which does not decay with time. Where possible, comparisons are made between the numerical and asymptotic solutions and good agreement is observed. The calculations described above are contrasted with the results from a similar forcing of a pair of semicircular cylinders which intersect the free surface at the same points as the trapping structure. For this second geometry no localized or unbounded oscillations are observed. The trapping structure is then given a sequence of perturbations which transform it into the two semicircular cylinders and the timedomain equations solved for a transient forcing of each structural geometry in the sequence. For small perturbations of the trapping structure, localized oscillations are produced which have a frequency close to that of the <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> but with amplitude that decays slowly with time. Estimates of the frequency and the rate of decay of the oscillation are made from the time-domain calculations. These values correspond to the real and imaginary parts of a pole in the complex force coefficient associated with a frequency-domain potential. An estimate of the position of this pole is obtained from calculations of the added mass and damping for the structure and shows good agreement with the time-domain results. Further time-domain calculations for a different trapping structure with more widely spaced elements show a number of interesting features. In particular, a transient forcing leads to persistent oscillations at two distinct frequencies, suggesting that there is either a second <b>trapped</b> <b>mode,</b> or a very lightly damped near-trapped mode. In addition a highly damped pumping mode is identified...|$|E
