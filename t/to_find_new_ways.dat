The process was then used on an entire episode of Dad's Army, showing {{that it was possible to}} use it on entire recordings.|$|E

He began organising , feeling that such public competitions would instil an appreciation for the art of the swordsman in their audiences. He started an organisation called the , which, inspired by the popularity of sumo wrestling, organised these contests. The first public kogyo organised by Sakakibara's group took place in April 1873, and lasted for over a week. Other martial artists, witnessing the success of the Gekken Kaisha, followed suit.|$|E
