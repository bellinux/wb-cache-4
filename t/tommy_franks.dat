CENTCOM oversees 250,000 US troops. Abizaid succeeded General <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks</b> as Commander, USCENTCOM, on July 7, 2003, and was also elevated {{to the rank of}} four-star general the same week.

500|$|During the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton used {{endorsements}} {{from the}} former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William J. Crowe, and 21 other retired generals and flag officers to counter doubts {{about his ability to}} serve as Commander in Chief. This became a feature of later presidential election campaigns. During the 2004 presidential election, twelve retired generals and admirals endorsed Senator John Kerry, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe, and the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Merrill [...] "Tony" [...] McPeak, who also appeared in television advertisements defending Kerry against the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. During this election campaign, one retired four-star General, <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks,</b> spoke at the Republican National Convention while another, John Shalikashvili, addressed the Democratic National Convention.|$|E
500|$|The {{quick and}} decisive {{results of the}} Gulf War were {{attributed}} to Schwarzkopf's leadership. Historian Rick Atkinson considered Schwarzkopf [...] "the most theatrical American in uniform since Douglas MacArthur." [...] Atkinson further contended that in his leadership during the Gulf War, Schwarzkopf conducted {{one of the greatest}} military campaigns of all time, providing the United States with its [...] "first battlefield hero in decades." [...] His accomplishments were later compared favorably to those of General <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks</b> during Operation Enduring Freedom. However, in an analysis {{of the effects of the}} Gulf War, several historians, including Spencer C. Tucker, contended that Schwarzkopf's ceasefire agreement allowed Iraq to continue to fly armed helicopters, which allowed it to later conduct operations against its Shia Arab and Kurdish populations. Schwarzkopf later wrote it would have been a mistake to continue the offensive and capture all of Iraq, noting that the U.S. would likely have had to pay the entire cost of rebuilding the country. In a 2012 book, historian Thomas E. Ricks wrote Schwarzkopf's lack of experience with politics were disadvantageous to his conduct of the war. Ricks said that Schwarzkopf was overly cautious in the execution of his plans because of his fear of repeating mistakes in Vietnam, which meant his troops failed to destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard. Ricks further criticized Schwarzkopf for failing to relieve General Frederick M. Franks Jr., as well as other subordinates who Schwarzkopf later said in his memoirs were ineffective. Ricks concluded that the Gulf War was a [...] "tactical triumph but a strategic draw at best." [...] In his memoirs, Schwarzkopf responded to these kinds of criticisms by saying his mandate had only been to liberate and safeguard Kuwait, and that an invasion of Iraq would have been highly controversial, particularly among Middle Eastern military allies.|$|E

2500|$|According to General <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks,</b> April Fool, an American officer working {{undercover}} as a diplomat, {{was approached}} by an Iraqi intelligence agent. April Fool then sold to the Iraqi false [...] "top secret" [...] invasion plans provided by Franks' team. This deception misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in northern and western Iraq in anticipation of attacks by way of Turkey or Jordan, which never took place. This greatly reduced the defensive capacity {{in the rest of}} Iraq and [...] facilitated the actual attacks via Kuwait and the Persian Gulf in the southeast.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. General <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks</b> assumed {{control of}} Iraq {{as the supreme}} {{commander}} of the coalition occupation forces.

In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks,</b> who {{commanded}} {{the invasion of}} Iraq, has since admitted that the bombing was designed to [...] "degrade" [...] Iraqi air defences {{in the same way}} as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf War. These [...] "spikes of activity" [...] were, in the words of then British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, designed to 'put pressure on the Iraqi regime' or, as The Times reported, to [...] "provoke Saddam Hussein into giving the allies an excuse for war". In this respect, as provocations designed to start a war, leaked British Foreign Office legal advice concluded that such attacks were illegal under international law.|$|E
2500|$|According to General <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks,</b> the {{objectives}} of the invasion were, [...] "First, end the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to search for, to capture and to drive out terrorists from that country. Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. Seventh, to secure Iraq's oil fields and resources, which belong to the Iraqi people. And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government." ...|$|E

2500|$|General <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks,</b> {{head of the}} United States Central Command, {{announced}} in 2002 that women {{would no longer be}} required to wear the abaya, although they would be [...] "encouraged" [...] to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change—which was strongly criticized by Saudi officials as both a violation of Islamic law and Saudi sovereignty—Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been [...] "under review" [...] before the lawsuit was filed. News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a court martial if she did not comply and wear the abaya.|$|E
2500|$|The Department of Defense's {{preliminary}} {{concerns for}} holding, housing, and interrogating captured prisoners {{on the battlefield}} were raised during the military build-up prior to the Iraq War. Because Saddam Hussein’s military forces surrendered when faced with military action, many within the DOD, including Rumsfeld and United States Central Command General <b>Tommy</b> <b>Franks,</b> decided {{it was in the}} best interest of all to hand these prisoners over to their respective countries. Additionally, it was determined that maintaining a large holding facility was, at the time, unrealistic. Instead, the use of many facilities such as Abu Ghraib would be utilized to house prisoners of interest prior to handing them over, and Rumsfeld defended the Bush administration's decision to detain enemy combatants. Because of this, critics, including members of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, would hold Rumsfeld responsible for the ensuing Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal. Rumsfeld himself said: [...] "These events occurred on my watch as Secretary of Defense. I am accountable for them." [...] He offered his resignation to President Bush in the wake of the scandal, but it was not accepted.|$|E
