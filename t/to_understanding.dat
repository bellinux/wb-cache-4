5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction. More importantly, {{he laid out}} his belief in Socinianism. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for Unitarians in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{associated with}} the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views.

In Love in Several Masques, the character Wisemore focuses on classics but ignores contemporary society. Similarly, the character Wilding, in The Temple Beau, practices law but doesn't read at all. Reading is an outlet <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> humanity, and Fielding uses his plays to inform an audience how {{to better understand}} humanity.|$|E

5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives.

The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why they are able to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E

Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G.

40|$|Indigenous {{religions}} are now present {{not only in}} their places of origin but globally. They are significant parts of the pluralism and diversity of the contemporary world, especially when their performance enriches and/or challenges host populations. Indigenous Diasporas and Dislocations engages with examples of communities with different experiences, expectations and evaluations of diaspora life. It contributes significantly to debates about indigenous cultures and religions, and <b>to</b> <b>understandings</b> of identity and alterity in late or post-modernity. This book promises <b>to</b> enrich <b>understanding</b> of indigenity, and of the globalized world in which indigenous people play diverse roles. ...|$|R
5|$|While genetic {{influences}} {{are important}} <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> obesity, they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally. Though it is accepted that energy consumption {{in excess of}} energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis, {{the cause of the}} shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} half of the period is largely prehistoric, {{archaeology}} plays an important part in studies of early Medieval Scotland. There are no significant contemporary internal sources for the Picts, although evidence has been gleaned from lists of kings, annals preserved in Wales and Ireland and from sources written down much later, which may draw on oral traditions or earlier sources. From the 7th century there is documentary evidence from Latin sources including the lives of saints, such as Adomnán's Life of St. Columba, and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Archaeological sources include settlements, art, and surviving everyday objects. Other aids <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> in this period include onomastics (the study of names) – divided into toponymy (place-names), showing the movement of languages, and the sequence in which different languages were spoken in an area, and anthroponymy (personal names), which can offer clues to relationships and origins.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{praised the}} manga for its {{creativity}} and {{described it as}} a quintessential shōjo manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the Seiun Award for Best Manga in 2001. The anime television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers. The artwork in the anime was also a focus of attention, described as above average for a late-1990s TV series, and Sakura's magic-casting scenes were complimented for being nearly unique because of the regular costume changes. The anime television series won the Animage Grand Prix award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of Cardcaptors, however, was heavily panned by critics for cutting out character backgrounds essential <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> the plot.|$|E

5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> {{literature}} as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E
5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms are central <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain {{to suggest that}} women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E
5|$|Rothenberg's {{legacy is}} not only the generations of {{scholars}} he prepared, but also his vast historiographical contribution <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> the Revolutionary era. For many years, his Army of Francis Joseph (1976) was the standard and the only English language analysis of the Habsburg Army in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic wars. He changed the widespread perception of Archduke Charles' military acumen. A masterful historian, Rothenberg was known furthermore as an eminently fair scholar. After publishing a critique of a publication, the author contacted him, and proved the critique unjust; Rothenberg immediately wrote to a review retracting the criticism, and the two scholars remained friends for the remainder of his life.|$|E
