40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was the optimisation of the thermal processing in cryopreservation of human red blood cells using the cryoprotectant hydroxyethyl starch such that cell damage induced by freezing and thawing can be reduced. The motivation for this work was the clinical application of the cryopreservation protocol, where a scale-up to bulk samples is required. In the experimental part, technical measures where tested and evaluated aiming to extend the range of cooling rates achieved during freezing with a finned freezing container. By comparing measurements of steady state and transient heat transfer, the temperature difference between the refrigerant liquid nitrogen and the finned profile {{turned out to be}} the main condition to achieve improved heat transfer. A new <b>thawing</b> <b>device</b> for rapid rewarming of cryopreserved samples was developed. The device is equipped with a double-sided field of jets impinging warmed water directly on the sample. In combination with this improved convective heat absorption, an orbital movement of the sample resulted in a clear improvement of the rewarming characteristics, as shown by temperature courses measured in a sample bag containing a test solution. A similar effect was achieved by using low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch, resulting from the decreased viscosity of the solution. A numerical study demonstrated that the heat transfer coefficient between frozen and liquid part of a sample during thawing is the key parameter for rapid rewarming. Further improvement can be achieved by increasing the bore diameter of the jets as well as increasing the frequency of the orbital movement. The results of cryopreservation studies indicate that the new thawing procedure is a suitable method to reduce the cellular damage, if the device is used in combination with low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch as cryoprotective agent. Therefore, the main goal of process optimisation by rapid rewarming was reached. The application of the aforementioned methods of increased cooling rates did not yield less cellular damage, if combined with rapid rewarming. Nevertheless, adjustment of the saline concentration of the cryoprotective solution turned out to be a potential measure to further optimise the cryopreservation protocol. By additional experimental studies, the determination of the oxygen transport capacity by rheooxymetry and a multiple step wash-out procedure were identified as an alternative to established vitality tests. The application of multiple freeze-thaw cycles resulted in an exponential decay of cell survival with the number of cycles indicating a stochastic process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract More than 3. 5 million blood {{products}} are transfused {{per year in}} Germany. The law regarding transfusions (Transfusionsgesetz) requires {{the implementation of a}} quality assurance system into daily hospital practice. Therefore, quality assurance with the use of {{blood products}} has to be considered a legal regulation for and constitutes a part of the daily routine for doctors administering blood products. Our studies differentiated between the legal aspects of quality assurance with the use of blood products and their implementation into daily practice: It has been shown that the implementation of a quality assurance system into the clinics was associated with a marked improvement in the documentation of the whereabouts of blood products and a substantial reduction of wastage of blood products saving more than 50. 000  for the hospital each year for the first two years after implementation. Furthermore, the use of approved <b>thawing</b> <b>devices</b> for fresh frozen plasma showed comparable results with regard to the activity of clotting factors immediately and up to 6 hours after the thawing procedure. In Germany 98. 500 operations were performed under open heart conditions using cardiopulmonary bypass in 2005. Patients in cardiac surgery have a high risk to be transfused which results in an estimated usage of about 20 % of donated blood in cardiac surgery only. Our studies investigated quality of care-oriented strategies to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in cardiac surgery and showed that the interruption of a combined antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) 2 days prior to cornary artery bypass graft surgery surgery was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative blood loss. Furthermore, hemodilution to an hematocrit of 20 % during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass did not result in a reduction of oxygen delivery and that the late administration (i. e. after admission to the ICU) of recombinant activated Factor VII for treatment of bleeding after cardiac surgery yielded a significant reduction in blood loss and transfusion requirements in the study group but was not superior to a conventional hemostatic therapy applied to a historic control group...|$|R
40|$|To assess {{sea bream}} (Sparus aurata) thawing, two ultrasonographic (US) {{protocols}} were used. The first protocol was used on 15 subjects at three different times immediately after capture, {{after the first}} thaw, and after the second <b>thaw.</b> A general-purpose <b>device</b> equipped with a linear high-frequency probe was used. On the B-mode-Real Time images, quantitative analysis of the epiaxial muscle gray levels was made. For the second protocol, a quantitative US (QUS) device was used on three groups of fish samples (fresh, thawed once, and thawed twice), each composed of five subjects. Speed of sound, bone ultrasound attenuation, bone mineral density, and quantitative ultrasound index were measured. Data were statistically compared using ANOVA (P < 0. 05). Gray levels differed significantly among the three control times. QUS data differed significantly between the fresh and thawed groups. US and QUS appear to be promising techniques for assessing fish thawing...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries and {{aquaculture}} {{are very}} important sectors in the Norwegian industry. Fish and its by-products are considered wholesome foodstuff and are popular especially due to their nutritional value. Therefore, consumer safety {{is a very important}} topic and methods for prolonging shelf-life {{play a vital role in}} the fishing and aquaculture industries. These methods are mostly based on cooling and freezing techniques, as bacteriological and enzymatic activities are generally reduced at low temperatures. However, freezing and cooling are quite energy- and time-consuming. Freezers are often designed as batch-operations, especially on board fishing vessels, and thus act as bottlenecks in the production chain. Therefore, an optimal operation should be imposed in order to minimize the time the good is spending in the freezer. If a good is in the freezer longer than necessary, this operation can be denoted as overfreezing. Hence, the aim is to monitor and operate the freezing processes in an optimal way with respect to quality, but also with regards to energy use and environmental impact. This can be achieved by a better understanding of the factors that influence the quality of fish and seafood during freezing and thawing. Furthermore, comprehension of the actual processes that happen during phase change are of importance; this includes the derivation of a mathematical model to describe the temperature evolution in the food. This model can also be used to monitor and operate the reversed freezing process, namely thawing. Considering not only freezing but also the thawing process as an additional and often inevitable production step makes sense due to the fact that it is difficult to process frozen fish. The thesis is structured into five parts, which are divided thematically: Introduction and Preliminaries, Mathematical Modeling, Freezing and Thawing Applications, Experiments and Closing Remarks. Part I gives an introduction to the context of this thesis. The importance of the fishing industry for the Norwegian economy is highlighted. Furthermore, preliminaries about topics related to freezing and thawing of foodstuff in general, and fish and fish products in particular, are presented. These preliminaries include methods of industrial applicable and more theoretical nature. Furthermore, a Chapter is dedicated to the concise introduction to quality aspects of fish, in a general way, but also with respect to freezing and thawing applications and processes. In Part II, a mathematical model for freezing and thawing processes is derived from the diffusion equation, a partial differential equation (PDE). This model represents a form of a linear heat equation, which is extended by a nonlinear term. This nonlinear term enters the equation due to the fact that phase change occurs in both freezing and thawing, and therefore the parameters of the diffusion equation are modeled state- and thus temperaturedependent. Similarities between this model and other types of PDEs, in particular the Burgers’ equation and its potential form, are investigated. However, due to the statedependency of the coefficients, known transformations can not be applied in order to use already established stability results for this kind of heat equation. Therefore, the stability of the model is investigated. This is conducted in order to show that the model can be used for describing freezing and thawing applications, which are in fact known to be stable due to the laws of thermodynamics. Part III presents applications of the model derived in Part II for freezing and thawing processes, respectively. Firstly, an observer based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is developed for both, freezing in plate freezers and thawing in contact <b>thawing</b> <b>devices.</b> The aim is to estimate the temperatures in the inner domain of a block of foodstuff. Therefore, some assumptions have to be imposed, e. g. that temperatures on the surface of the block are measurable. Secondly, the models are subject to Optimal Control Problems (OCP), where an optimal input function, meaning the temperature at the boundaries, is calculated in order to either optimally freeze or thaw blocks of foodstuff. This is done for open loop Optimal Control (OOC), which holds for perfect knowledge of the process with no measurement and estimation disturbances. Furthermore, closed loop Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied, where measurement / estimation errors as well as discrepancies between the model and the real process are taken into account. In Part IV experimental results for a freezing process in a horizontal plate freezer and a thawing process in a rebuilt horizontal plate freezer adapted for thawing purposes (plate thawer) are shown. Both of these experiments have been conducted at Matís Food Research in Reykjavík, Iceland. The freezing experiments were conducted with a rectangular tray made of aluminum, which was placed in between the plate freezer walls and filled with tap water. Temperature loggers were placed in several positions inside the tray to log the temperature during phase change from liquid to solid. Ammonia was used as the refrigerant in the plate freezer. For the thawing process the same tray was used. Blocks of frozen headed and gutted (H/G) cod were placed inside the tray and between the walls of the re-built plate freezer. The medium to thaw the fish blocks was tap water. Temperature loggers were attached to the fish blocks, namely in the center, half-way to the center and just below the surface. In Part V the thesis is closed with the conclusion and an outlook on future work...|$|R
