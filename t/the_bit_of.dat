25|$|In Simple Electromagnetic Analysis (SEMA) attacks, the {{attacker}} deduces the key directly by observing the trace. It is very effective against asymmetric cryptography implementations. Typically, {{only a few}} traces are needed, though {{the attacker}} {{needs to have a}} strong understanding of the cryptographic device and of the implementation of the cryptographic algorithm. An implementation vulnerable to SEMA attacks will perform a different operation depending on whether <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the key is 0 or 1, which will use different amounts of power and/or different chip components. This method is prevalent in many different types of side-channel attacks, in particular, power analysis attacks. Thus, the attacker can observe the entire computation of encryption and can deduce the key.|$|E
25|$|Though {{publication}} was in 1975, and {{the novel}} was written over 30 years earlier, {{it remains to}} set the time period of the story, beyond summer time. The age of Hastings' daughter puts the story after the Second World War, as does the complete absence of war time conditions and restrictions (e.g., no mention of rationing or bombing in London), but nothing sets a specific post-war year. <b>The</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> arithmetic to show the story is set post-war starts from the marriage of Arthur Hastings and Dulcie (Cinderella) Duveen {{at the end of}} The Murder on the Links (published in 1923), and some years needed for the births of their four children, of whom Judith, age 21, appears to be the youngest. The story was not rewritten to add more specific markers of the years post Second World War, such as car models, clothing styles, or world events. The story clearly ends Poirot's career, as he dies in the novel, using his death for a resolution he had never before considered for a murderer: to become one himself. Poirot's death was announced in the New York Times, a rare honor for a fictional character.|$|E

2500|$|Apart from serialization, {{the terms}} bit endianness and bit-level endianness are seldom used, as {{computer}} architectures where each individual bit {{has a unique}} address are rare. Individual bits or bit fields are accessed via their numerical value or, in high-level programming languages, assigned names, the effects of which, however, may be machine dependent or lack software portability. The natural numbering is that the arithmetic left shift 1<<n yields a mask for <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> position n, a rule which exhibits the machine's (byte) endianness at least if [...] e.g. if used for indexing a sufficiently large bit array. Other numberings do occur in various documentations.|$|E
