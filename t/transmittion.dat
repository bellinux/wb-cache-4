Two technologies {{have been used for}} the deposition of the coating: the technology of conventional casting for the tin-base coating "Stanit" and the technology of thermal spray coating for the tin coating "Babbitt", copper-base coating CuSn 8 and for an NiAl interlayer. The above coating types have been compared using metallography, non-destructive ultrasonic and dye penetrant testing, X-ray diffraction, GD-OES depth profiling and energy-dispersive electron microanalysis. The following information has been collected that has to be sorted acording to the deposition technology used. For the evaluation of adhesion between the steel substrate and the coatings prepared by conventional casting, suitability of the ultrasound testing was proved, with the dye penetrant test as a supplementary method. Measurement parameters were defined for the ultrasonic testing. For te WAS technology (wire arc spraying), the non-destructive methods did not prove to be reasonably applicable in practice. The reason is that significant changes in the morphology of the structure occur in this technology. Layered structure with interfaces between the splatters of the coating, non-deformed particles and single layers of the coating results in a strong attenuation of the ultrasound waves. The coating exhibit a poor acoustic <b>transmittion</b> or no acoustic <b>transmittion</b> at all. results obtained by the non-destructive methods and other experimental methods used have been compared and a good agreement was found.

The paper describes the two proposed modulation schemes, non-overlapped FMT and half-overlapped FMT. This modulations utilize the benefits of implementing FFT algorithm {{in conjunction with a}} bank of polyphase filters that are derived from the prototype filter. To design the prototype filter a Matlab tool is developed. For both modulations the simulation models were created for xDSL systems and for wireless transmission channel. Non-overlapped FMT modulation proved to be a suitable modulation scheme for channels with narrowband interference and sharp edges in the transmission function of the channel. It was allowed by perfect separation of each subchannel and with preserving the orthogonality between subchannels using the FFT algorithm and utilization of appropriate filters. Half-overlapped FMT modulation allows as well as the DMT modulation optimal utilization of provided <b>transmittion</b> band, because the power spectral density of the signal is flat. But it is not suitable for transmission channels with roughly shaped by changes in the transmission function and narrowband interference. Optimization implementations were designed using parallel processing on the DSP Texas Instruments TMS 320 C 67 x series. It thus achieved almost ten-fold reduction in computational complexity.

With the development of protocols, increase trensfer throughput, creating a new data <b>transmittion</b> technology, allowing unauthorized visitors online visits, which may cause unexpected losses for the company. For this reason, we need to prevent burglary before it takes place. With the development of methods of attack, {{we are forced to}} improve safeguard tools. This paper will examine the security systems and their application areas, using sourses collected, also created a versatile industry network security system that separates the LAN (Local Access Network) – the company network from the unsafe network, which is the main source of the attacks. Universal network security system consists of conventional intrusion detection, intrusion prevention and firewall security system. In addition, an overview of the internal LAN security systems designed to prevent the intrusion of internal origin. Joint network security system consists of conventional intrusion detection, intrusion prevention and firewall security system. Made network analysis reports by DoS (Denial of Service) attacks criteria also detected pps (packets per second) bandwidth increase by 1879 % and 3729 % (in different assessment methods) investigation of Internet data traffic, while visiting potentially harmful content sites. Based on this test, Matlab Simulink environment carried out in the usual firewall and security system, which includes a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention system, whose main advantage is the possibility of real-time supplement hacking database research. This system is suitably against the attacks of sources detected by examining the message header...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{represents the}} summary of knowledge gained {{both in the}} Czech Republic and worldwide, concerning the use of hippotherapy at the healing process of cerebral palsy at children. The method itself is described in the summary of several studies, suggesting the effect of hippotherapy on cerebral palsy infliction. The thesis consists of three parts. The first part deals with the characteristic of cerebral palsy as a neuromuscular disease with a variety of etiology and pathogenesis being the cause of movement and posture disorders. The second part {{is focused on the}} hippotherapy as a unique therapeutic method using a specific element - the movement of a walking horse´s back. The patient is influenced in three levels - frontal, saggital and transversal. The stimuli are transmitted onto the patient with the effect on their central nervous system. Subsequently the central nervous system becomes adapted to the horse´s back deflection and a new motoric pattern is fixed. The healing proces of cerebral palsy at children is described in several studies that are presented. These are completed by factors that have their specific influence on the hippotherapeutic unit. The thesis is concluded by a text dealing with the issue of horses themselves. It suggests criteria that are important during the selection of horses suitable for hippotherapy such as breed, age and sex of horses and the morphology of the horse´s back and its motion. Last but not least the thesis also presents the basic knowledge of the general mechanics of horse motion that has an important influence on the motion of the horse´s back and thus the impact {{on the quality of the}} impulse <b>transmittion</b> onto the patient...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on the strip road where longitudinal slopes were determined by the leveling method {{as well as individual}} distances of the strip road of uniform slope. Skidders were used for carrying out traction tests in downhill and uphill skidding of 9 different loads. Measurement of wheel loads, wheel torques and components of rope force was performed by tensiometric method and remote transferring of measurement signal. According to the results of research, by the increase of longitudinal slope, more tractive force is used for overcoming the terrain slope than for overcoming the traction resistance. In downhill skidding, the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) acts in the skidder travel direction and hence its value is higher than the traction resistance. Torque distribution depends on the skidder wheel vertical load. In uphill skidding, torques increase proportionally to the vertical component of rope forces and adhesive weight of the skidder. In downhill skidding, the skidder wheel torques are negative, because they are not used for achieving wheel tractive force and instead, the transmission of torque through the transmission system causes skidder’s braking performance. The skidder’s need for braking arises under influence of the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) that acts {{in the direction of the}} skidder travel and under its effect the traction resistances are overcome. It can be concluded that in case of downhill skidding we cannot speak of achieving real tractive force because the skidder pulls the load only by its weight, and the <b>transmittion</b> from engine to wheels is not used for achieving the tractive force...|$|E
