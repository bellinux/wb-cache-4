5|$|In {{the midst}} of the upheaval, the new Palladium had opened. The Senators, still coached by Allison, lost their opening game in the arena 3–0 to Montreal on January 17, 1996. The event was much more subdued than their franchise's first game. The Cup banners were raised, but the winches jammed, {{blocking}} <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> fans. There were no entertainment big names, and only Firestone and Bryden participated in the ceremonial face-off. The club would lose its first four games at the Palladium, winning none for Allison, who was later fired on January 24 after the team lost 22 of 25 games. While Ottawa finished last in the League for the fourth year in a row, the 1995–96 season ended with renewed optimism, partly from the debut of new star Daniel Alfredsson, who won the Calder Trophy, the NHL rookie of the year award, the first Senator to do so. Alfredsson, selected 133rd overall in 1994, was also selected to play in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Anglican {{bishops and}} apologists {{was that the}} {{required}} references to the sacrificial priesthood never existed in many ancient Latin Rite ordination liturgies, or in certain Eastern-Rite ordination liturgies that the Roman Catholic Church considered to be valid.

Further building has been substantially in accord with Yamasaki's vision, notwithstanding some controversy over the years as to the suitability of its austere style for the featureless Regina plain; by 1972 with the demolition of Yamasaki's 1955 Pruitt–Igoe housing project in St. Louis, Missouri—such demolition being considered by some to be the beginning of postmodern architecture—Yamasaki's modernist aesthetic was already somewhat passé in <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> architects.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> historians, the Constantinian shift turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into one capable of persecution and sometimes eager to persecute.

However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops.
