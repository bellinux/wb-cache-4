Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|The Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication {{commissioned}} {{studies in}} 1975 and 1987 {{on the state}} of public relations in education. They found <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major. In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone's career. PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis.|$|E

25|$|During the Industrial Revolution, large {{corporations}} became increasingly {{opposed to this}} policy. They argued <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> valuable business relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive adversarial litigation, in courts whose rules differed significantly from the informal norms and conventions of businesspeople (the private law of commerce, or jus merchant). Arbitration was promoted as being faster, less adversarial, and cheaper.|$|E

25|$|Self-perception is a {{specialized}} form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists have found <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a {{phenomenon known as}} overjustification. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered. This is an important exception to reinforcement theory.|$|E

He was also a supporter of the Government's plan to nationalise the steel industry, which was the most controversial of all its nationalisation proposals.

Above all, the Spartans know no other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The Cretan institutions, he says, are even worse.|$|E

25|$|British writer Arthur C.

He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E
25|$|Vanderbilt University Owen Graduate School of Management {{has been}} in {{operation}} since 1969, but the university's first proposal for a business education program came from its Board of Trust (BOT) in 1881. They called it the Commercial College Department. No program was established then, however, {{and it was the}} mid-1950s before a program of business administration was offered in the Department of Economics. With the economic growth in Nashville and Middle Tennessee at that time, local businessmen, many of whom were Vanderbilt alumni and BOT members, recognized the need for a formal business education program to train leaders for the area. They were concerned <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> aspiring young businessmen would attend schools {{in other parts of the}} country and then remain in those regions.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the influx}} of high-schoolers caused {{considerable}} controversy. When the NBA and its players union negotiated a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) in 2005, NBA Commissioner David Stern publicly called for a higher age limit of 20, stating that he wanted the league's scouts and general managers {{out of high school}} gyms and <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> young urban Americans incorrectly saw the NBA as a sure path to fame and financial security. Most of the players were opposed to an age limit; Jermaine O'Neal was perhaps the most strident critic, accusing the NBA of racism. Ultimately, the union reluctantly agreed to an age limit of 19, accepting it in exchange for tweaks to salary cap rules that were favorable to the players' interests.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, all states and territories in Australia {{developed}} intended curriculum documents {{largely based on}} OBE for their primary and secondary schools. Criticism arose shortly after implementation. Critics argued that no evidence existed that OBE could be implemented successfully on a large scale, in either the United States or Australia. An evaluation of Australian schools found that implementing OBE was difficult. Teachers felt overwhelmed {{by the amount of}} expected achievement outcomes. Educators believed that the curriculum outcomes did not attend {{to the needs of the}} students or teachers. Critics felt <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> expected outcomes left students with shallow understanding of the material. Many of Australia’s current education policies have moved away from OBE and towards a focus on fully understanding the essential content, rather than learning more content with less understanding.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{multitude of}} scholastic {{studies have shown}} that the linguistic styles of GLB and straight people are not mutually exclusive. Munson et al. (2006), for instance, examined the gradient nature of perceived sexual orientation by having 40 listeners rate 44 talkers' sexual orientation on a five-point equally appearing interval scale. The 44 talkers included equal number of GLB and straight people. When averaged across the 40 listeners, ratings for individual talkers showed some overlap between GLB and straight people. For example, the two men who were tied with the most-gay average ratings included one self-identified straight man, and one self-identified gay man. While there are group level differences between GLB and straight people in the gay soundness of their voices, overlap does exist, providing a serious challenge to a simple model in which speech differences were the inevitable consequence of sexual orientation. The fact that there is no clean cut between the linguistic patterns of GLB and straight people suggests <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> generations in the study of language and gender can be dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the cuts}} to coal {{production}} and falling percentage of coal {{in the energy}} mix, electricity consumption {{is expected to grow}} by 3.6-4 percent over 2016 to 2020 according to the Thirteenth Plan (2016–2020). According to the same five-year plan, coal power capacity will be expanded from 960 GW to under 1,100 GW by the end of 2020 to meet some of the continued growth in electricity demand. Indeed, in the first two months of 2016, China had added 22 GW of capacity, 14 GW of which was coal, according to the China Electricity Council. To curtail the continued rapid construction of coal fired power plants, strong action was taken in April of the same year by the National Energy Administration (NEA), which issued a directive curbing construction {{in many parts of the}} country. This was followed up in January 2017 when the NEA canceled a further 103 coal power plants, eliminating 120 gigawatts of future coal-fired capacity, despite the resistance of local authorities mindful of the need to create jobs. The decreasing rate of construction is due to the realization <b>that</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> power plants had been built and some existing plants were being used far below capacity.|$|E
