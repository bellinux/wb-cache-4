40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the thermo-mechanical durability of ITER it is proposed to castellate the interior surface of the first wall and divertor by splitting them into small-size cells [W. Daener et a]., Fusion Eng. Des. 61 & 62 (2002) 61]. A concern is the accumulation of fuel in <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> of <b>the</b> castellation. In TEXTOR, molybdenum limiters were exposed in the scrape-off layer (SOL) plasma to assess fuel accumulation. The first limiter was exposed under deposition-dominated conditions. Carbon deposits were formed both on top surfaces and in <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> About 0. 12 % of the impinging D-fluence was found in <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> Another castellated limiter was exposed under erosion-dominated conditions. Deposited layers were found only on the plasma shadowed areas of <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> A significant amount of molybdenum from the limiter was found intermixed in <b>the</b> deposit. <b>The</b> <b>gaps</b> contained similar to 0. 03 % of the impinging D-fluence.

5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> {{between rich and poor}} students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E
