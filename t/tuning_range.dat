25|$|The BC-224-A, -B, -C, and -D, and the BC-348-B, and -C, tuned 1.5-18 MHz in six bands. The Signal Corps had the {{receiver}} design modified {{to add a}} 200-500 kHz band and compress the 1.5-18MHz coverage into the remaining five bands. This modified design became the BC-224-E and the BC-348-E. The 200–500kHz and 1.5-18MHz <b>tuning</b> <b>range</b> remained constant for subsequent production of all models.|$|E
25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing. Difference frequency mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a tunable visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the <b>tuning</b> <b>range</b> to longer than about 110nm. Tunable VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for extended-cavity diode-laser tuning to achieve wide mode-hop-free <b>tuning</b> <b>ranges.</b> By using a multiple piezoactuated grating mount, the cavity length and grating angle in the laser can be adjusted independently, allowing mode-hop-free tuning {{without the need for}} a mechanically optimized pivot-point mount. Furthermore, synchronized diode injection-current tuning allows diode lasers without antireflection coatings to be employed. In combination these two techniques make the construction of a cheap, efficient, and easily optimized extended-cavity diode laser possible. A theoretical analysis is presented for optimal control of piezoactuator displacements and injection current to achieve the widest possible mode-hop-free <b>tuning</b> <b>ranges,</b> and a comparison is made with measurements.

In the system design of a frequency synthesizer, states Manassewitsch, there are as many [...] "best" [...] design procedures as there are experienced synthesizer designers. System analysis of a frequency synthesizer involves output frequency range (or frequency bandwidth or <b>tuning</b> <b>range),</b> frequency increments (or resolution or frequency tuning), frequency stability (or phase stability, compare spurious outputs), phase noise performance (e.g., spectral purity), switching time (compare settling time and rise time), and size, power consumption, and cost.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} in RF multiplexer design to integrate a single monopole–type antenna to a receiver with large, multiband <b>tuning</b> <b>ranges.</b> Traditional techniques to integrate a single antenna with such receivers are limited {{in their ability to}} handle simultaneous channels distributed over very large <b>tuning</b> <b>ranges,</b> which is important for frequency-agile cognitive radio, surveillance, and other applications requiring wideband or multiband monitoring. In our approach, the goal is first to achieve sensitivity which is nominally dominated by external (environmental) noise, and then secondly to improve bandwidth to the maximum possible consistent with this goal. A procedure is described for designing antenna–multiplexer– preamplifier assemblies using this philosophy. It is shown that the approach can significantly increase the usable bandwidth and number of bands that can be supported by a single, traditional antenna. A three channel (10 – 28 MHz, 32 – 50 MHz, and 54 – 80 MHz) multiplexer for a VHF monopole antenna was designed and performance was validated through field experiment...|$|R
