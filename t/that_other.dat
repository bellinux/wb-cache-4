40|$|Learning <b>that</b> <b>others</b> {{earn more}} may reduce {{individual}} well-being {{but can also}} be informative about the own income prospects. This paper provides experimental evidence that separates direct effects of income comparisons on well-being and informational effects from observing changes in the income of others. In an environment of uncertainty about the own income we find that both the direct comparison effects and the informational effects are asymmetric. Individual beliefs about the own income are adjusted downwards when observing <b>that</b> <b>others</b> are likely to earn less but do not change significantly when observing <b>that</b> <b>others</b> are likely to earn more. Individual satisfaction decreases when observing <b>that</b> <b>others</b> are likely to earn more but does not change significantly when observing <b>that</b> <b>others</b> are likely to earn less. Overall, individuals are more reactive to bad news than to good news...|$|R

25|$|Jackson and Williams (1985) {{proposed}} {{that if someone}} feels <b>that</b> <b>others</b> in the group are slacking or <b>that</b> <b>others</b> will slack, he will lower his effort to match <b>that</b> of the <b>others.</b> This can occur whether it is apparent <b>that</b> the <b>others</b> are slacking or if someone simply believes that the group is slacking. For example, in the Latane et al. study above, if a participant heard the others making less noise than anticipated, he could have lowered his effort {{in an attempt to}} equal <b>that</b> of the <b>others,</b> rather than aiming for the optimum.|$|R
5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} its {{interior}} chemistry, that the comet formed in the Uranus and Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System.

5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages.

5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles.
