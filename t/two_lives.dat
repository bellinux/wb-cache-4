5|$|The Baden-Powells visited Schiff in 1935 {{and began}} a steadfast {{friendship}} with the Hillcourts. Baden-Powell died in 1941. After World WarII, Baden-Powell's widow, Olave Baden-Powell, allowed Hillcourt to edit Aids to Scoutmastership into the World Brotherhood Editions to help the Scouting movement recover from the war. She then allowed Hillcourt access to Baden-Powell's letters, diaries and sketchbooks when she and Hillcourt co-authored the narrative biography of Baden-Powell, Baden-Powell: The <b>Two</b> <b>Lives</b> of a Hero.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping to save at least <b>two</b> <b>lives.</b> During the scene in which Homer chokes on a donut, a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is {{on the wall behind}} him. In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} Debby {{maintained}} plenty of intensity over northern Europe, and on September 21 it struck northern parts of Finland (where {{it was named}} storm Mauri) {{as one of the}} most powerful windstorms in the country's recorded history. Winds over 90 mph (145 km/h) felled millions of cubic miles of forest, and a storm surge severely damaged the cities of Kemi and Tornio, claiming <b>two</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} various other shipwrecks in the vicinity. In 1889 the paddle steamer Mountaineer {{lived up to}} its name by clambering onto Lady's Rock, the damage to which was still visible in 1995. In 1905 the MacBrayne {{steamship}} Clydesdale hit the same obstruction in a Force 6 wind. The harbour patrol craft Appletree was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of <b>two</b> <b>lives.</b> The trawler MFV Solway Firth foundered south of this position in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} left Barnett and captain Yardley {{as the new}} men at the crease. Both players {{attacked the}} bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall {{was forced to leave}} the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned onto the front foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four, and was then given <b>two</b> <b>lives.</b> He hit Johnston hard to cover, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter {{was present}} when Santee {{captured}} the Confederate States Navy schooner C.P. Knapp off the Florida coast and the CSN brig Delta off Galveston in October. He {{was selected for}} a night-time cutting out operation that was intended to capture and burn the Confederate armed steamer General Rusk. After the boats ran aground and it took time to free them, the officer in charge chose a picket boat called the Royal Yacht as an alternate target. They captured it {{at the cost of}} <b>two</b> <b>lives,</b> setting fire to it and taking a dozen prisoners. Carpenter was one of the wounded, having been stabbed in the thigh during the hand-to-hand fighting, and was mentioned in dispatches.|$|E
25|$|Other eleventh-century {{writers are}} Theodosius, a monk of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, who {{wrote on the}} Latin faith and some Pouchenia or Instructions, and Luka Zhidiata, bishop of Novgorod, who has left us a curious Discourse to the Brethren. From the {{writings}} of Theodosius we see that many pagan habits were still in vogue among the people. He finds fault with them for allowing these to continue, and also for their drunkenness; nor do the monks escape his censures. Zhidiata writes in a more vernacular style than many of his contemporaries; he eschews the declamatory tone of the Byzantine authors. And here may be mentioned the many lives of the saints and the Fathers {{to be found in}} early East Slavic literature, starting with the <b>two</b> <b>Lives</b> of Sts Boris and Gleb, written in the late eleventh century and attributed to Jacob the Monk and to Nestor the Chronicler.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, major {{retrospective}} of Leibovitz's work {{was held at}} the Brooklyn Museum, The retrospective was based on her book, Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer's Life, 1990–2005 and included many of her professional (celebrity) photographs as well as numerous personal photographs of her family, children, and partner Susan Sontag. This show, which was expanded to include three of the official portraits of Queen Elizabeth II, then went on the road for seven stops. It was on display at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from October 2007 to January 2008 and at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco from March 2008 to May 2008. In February 2009, the exhibition was moved to Berlin, Germany. The show included 200 photographs. At the exhibition, Leibovitz showed that she doesn't have <b>two</b> <b>lives,</b> career and personal, but has one wherein assignments and personal pictures are all part of her works. This exhibition and her talk focused on her personal photographs and life.|$|E
