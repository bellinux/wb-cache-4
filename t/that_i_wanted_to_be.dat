500|$|Frusciante {{became friends}} with former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988. They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend Flea (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea {{developed}} a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging {{that might have been}} the day he first played the bass riff to [...] "Nobody Weird Like Me". Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, [...] "I realized <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do that if I was in Zappa's band." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christy Mathewson {{later said}} of {{the moment when he}} took the mound at Fenway Park, [...] "This was {{the only place in the}} world <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> [...] I could think of nothing greater than {{pitching}} this game for the glory of the New York Giants." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E
50|$|I can {{do nothing}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, go nowhere where <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go, and see nothing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see. If <b>I</b> turn into the street, I am {{followed}} by a multitude.|$|R
5000|$|Slamer {{had never}} met Walsh until he showed up for the audition. [...] "I decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move to America," [...] says Slamer. [...] "The kind of music <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make wasn't being played at all in England, so I came here." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Haus of Gaga {{is modeled}} after Andy Warhol's Factory and emulates the {{creative}} atmosphere {{it is known}} for. Inspired by Warhol's concepts, his ideas are often referenced in Gaga's work and the innovative technologies conceived by the Haus. [...] "Warhol said art should be meaningful in the most shallow way," [...] Gaga explained in an interview. [...] "He {{was able to make}} commercial art that was taken seriously as fine art ... that's what I'm doing too." [...] The team is composed of people from around the world. As the artist explained:I called all my coolest art friends and we sat in a room and <b>I</b> said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make my face light up. Or <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make my cane light up. Or <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a pair of dope sunglasses. Or <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make video glasses, or whatever it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. It's a whole amazing creative process thatâ€™s completely separate from the label.By integrating the themes explored in Gaga's music into her appearance, the Haus idealizes a lifestyle hybrid of pop culture, art, and technology.|$|R
60|$|And here, losing patience, I {{broke out}} afresh with a cry <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> liberated--to get {{out into the}} air--I was almost in a fever.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted a}} lover to love," [...] she said. [...] "Every girl of course wants <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tremendously excited.... And {{at the same}} time I dreaded the {{enormous}} interference....|$|E
6000|$|Lucy Coulson {{lifted her}} eyes to his a moment, and then glanced aside, while there was a {{significant}} softness in her voice as she said, [...] "The news seemed so good <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the one who told it you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You Bob Gliddery,' said Miss Abbey to this pot-boy, 'run {{round to}} Hexam's and tell his {{daughter}} Lizzie <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> speak to her.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't tell. It was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> truthful. I couldn't bear deceiving him as to {{the facts}} of life. And yet I wasn't truthful, for with a false {{delicacy}} I told him too obscurely.--Why was I half-wiser than my fellow-women? And not entirely wiser! Why didn't I tell him pleasant untruths, instead of half-realities? It was my want of self-control, so that I could neither conceal things nor reveal them!" ...|$|E
60|$|For my own part, I {{had been}} feverishly excited all day. Something very like the war fever that {{occasionally}} runs through a civilised community had got into my blood, {{and in my}} heart I was not so very sorry that I {{had to return to}} Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in at the death.|$|E
60|$|We had {{arranged}} that Rectus {{was to go}} first. This did not look very brave on my part, but I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under him, while he was climbing, so that I could break his fall if he should slip down. It would not be exactly a perpendicular fall, for the wall slanted a little, {{but it would be}} bad enough. However, I had climbed up worse places than that, and Rectus was very nimble; so I felt there was no great danger.|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. It's not so {{much what}} you hope as what you believe, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know.|$|R
5000|$|Cody Custer - If you've got a bull that you're {{going to}} look at and say I'd like to own a bull like that, he's one that every guy thinks he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be stock {{contractor}} would want that a bull and every guy that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be a great bull rider would say that's the bull <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get on, <b>that's</b> the bull <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ride.|$|R
60|$|You can't get round me with polite words. I'm sick of all <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> speak straight.|$|R
60|$|My {{mother said}} nothing, but took {{me up in}} her arms, and carried me back to bed, and then, sitting down beside me, and holding my hand in hers--there was not so very much {{difference}} in the size--began to sing in that low, caressing voice of hers that always made me feel, for the time being, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a good boy, a song she often used to sing to me, and that I have never heard any one else sing since, and should not care to.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{sure you}} are! If I were a man, I should be passionately {{in love with}} you. I've got a new dance where I'm {{supposed}} to be a nymph pursued by a faun; it's so difficult to feel like a nymph when you know it's only the ballet-master. Do you think I ought to put passion into that? You see, I'm supposed to be flying all the time; but it would be much more subtle, wouldn't it, if I could give the impression <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> caught. Don't you think so?" ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{said nothing}} more to John, {{but in the next}} few days I got all my {{arrangements}} made and my things packed. And when the last afternoon came I sat down and wrote John a long letter, to leave on my boudoir table, telling him that I had gone to Bermuda. I told him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone: I said that I couldn't tell when I would be back--that it might be months, or it might be years, and I hoped that he would try to be as happy as he could and forget me entirely, and to send me money on the first of every month.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> leave!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Never! When <b>I</b> say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{live here}} myself, that my heart {{will not let}} me go {{anywhere}} else, <b>I</b> mean <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> live here too--you, your mother and father--that I want--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you understand," [...] she {{interrupted}} impatiently, [...] "that it is {{just this}} very moment, this instant, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get away? Something has gone wrong. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave Monte Carlo. I am not sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see it again.

5000|$|JÃ¶rgen Elofsson - [...] "I decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{concentrate}} {{solely on}} writing music {{and not being}} an artist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say it, because I shouldn't eva wish {{to say it}} again. I {{know that}} all the time you we'e betta than what you did, and I blame myself a good deal moa fo' not knowing when you came to Florence that I had begun to ca'e fo'some one else. But I did wait till I could see you again, so as to be su'a which I ca'ed for the most. I tried to be fai'a, before I told you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free. That is all," [...] she said, gently, and Gregory {{perceived}} that the word was left definitely to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two o'clock.--Armadale here as usual; {{eager to}} know when Midwinter will be at his service. No {{definite}} answer {{to be given to}} the question yet, seeing that it all depends on Midwinter's capacity to continue at his desk. Armadale sat down disappointed; he yawned, and put his great clumsy hands in his pockets. I took up a book. The brute didn't understand <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left alone; he began again on the unendurable subject of Miss Milroy, and of all the fine things she was to have when he married her. Her own riding-horse; her own pony-carriage; her own beautiful little sitting-room upstairs at the great house, and so on. All that I might have had once Miss Milroy is to have now--if I let her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Agatha's eyes dilated; {{evanescent}} flushes played {{upon her}} cheeks and neck; she stamped with her heel. [...] "Uncle John," [...] she cried, [...] "if you dare to address me like that, I will never look at you, never speak to you, nor ever enter your house again. What {{do you know about}} good manners, that you should call me impertinent? I will not submit to intentional rudeness; {{that was the beginning of}} my quarrel with Miss Wilson. She told me I was impertinent, and I went away and told her that she was wrong by writing it in the fault book. She has been wrong all through, and I would have said so before but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reconciled to her and to let bygones be bygones. But if she insists on quarrelling, I cannot help it." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{occurs to}} me that you may perhaps know, or know of, a kind of man <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> discover.|$|R
6000|$|She protested. [...] "Please don't say <b>that!</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} this morning especially fine. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it <b>to</b> bring us all good luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every one of them. I really don't suppose <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to}} show my face here at all. I have simply come to say good-bye. There is just a single word <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say to Anne." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{do want to}} {{tell you}} certain things. I {{want to tell you}} them because they are things that affect you closely. There was almost from the first a {{difference}} between Mary and myself in this, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> public about our love, I wanted to be open and defiant, and she--hesitated. She wanted to be secret. She wanted to keep me; I sometimes think that she was moved to become my mistress because she wanted to keep me. But she also wanted to keep everything else in her life,--her position, her ample freedoms and wealth and dignity. Our love was to be a secret cavern, Endymion's cave. I was ready enough to do what I could to please her, and for a time I served that secrecy, lied, pretended, agreed to false addresses, assumed names, and tangled myself in a net-work of furtive proceedings. These are things that poison and consume honest love.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{he did not}} {{altogether}} discourage my literary projects, promised to procure me work from the booksellers, and faithfully performed that kind promise. [...] "But," [...] says he, [...] "sir, you must not appear amongst them in forma pauperis.--Have you never a friend's coach, {{in which we can}} ride to see them? You must put on your best laced hat and waistcoat; and we must appear, sir, as if we were doing them a favour." [...] This stratagem answered, and procured me respect enough at the first visit or two; but when the booksellers knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid for my work, their backs refused to bend any more, and they treated me with a familiarity which I could ill stomach. I overheard one of them, who had been a footman, say, [...] "Oh, it's Pocahontas, is it? let him wait." [...] And he told his boy to say as much to me. [...] "Wait, sir?" [...] says I, fuming with rage and putting my head into his parlour, [...] "I'm not accustomed to waiting, but I have heard you are." [...] And I strode out of the shop into Pall Mall in a mighty fluster.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{stood looking}} at {{the great wall of}} empty hogsheads in front of me, {{wondering}} if it would not be better to give up searching any more on this vessel, which evidently had not been laden with anything valuable, and go again on board the Spanish ship and make some sort of a plan for fastening lines to those treasure-boxes so that they might be hauled up on board the brig, I began to feel a sort of trouble with my breath, as if I might suffocate if I did not get out soon. I knew, of course, that something was the matter with my air-supply, and I signalled for them to pump lively. But it was of no use; my supply of fresh air seemed to be cut off. I began to gasp. I was terribly frightened, you may be sure; for, with air gone and no answer to my signals, I must perish. I jerked savagely at my signal-cord to let them know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pulled up,--it was possible that I might reach the surface before being suffocated,--but the cord offered no resistance; I pulled it toward me as I jerked. It had been cut or broken.|$|E
