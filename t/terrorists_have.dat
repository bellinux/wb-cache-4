Officials believe the list of registered students matches the number of students evacuated or captured from the mosque and Jamia Hafsa.|$|E
5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The <b>terrorists</b> <b>have</b> the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E

25|$|Islamic {{terrorism}} is, by definition, {{terrorist acts}} committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or Islamist motivations or goals. Islamic <b>terrorists</b> <b>have</b> relied on particular {{interpretations of the}} tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, child-molestation and slavery. In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in Europe, Russia, and the United States, and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims. In {{a number of the}} worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these <b>terrorists</b> <b>have</b> been met by armed, independent resistance groups, state actors and their proxies, and politically liberal Muslim protesters.|$|E

The bureau chief decided against running the story until more details and further confirmation had been obtained. There were other leaks.|$|E
25|$|Today, the Senate sent {{a strong}} {{signal to the}} terrorists that we will {{continue}} using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and to prevent attacks on America. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected <b>terrorists</b> <b>have</b> been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Information we have learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.|$|E
25|$|India claims these insurgents are Islamic {{terrorist}} groups from Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Afghanistan, fighting to make Jammu and Kashmir {{a part of}} Pakistan. They claim Pakistan supplies munitions to the terrorists and trains them in Pakistan. India states that the <b>terrorists</b> <b>have</b> killed many citizens in Kashmir and committed human rights violations whilst denying that their own armed forces are responsible for human rights abuses. On a visit to Pakistan in 2006, former Chief Minister of Kashmir Omar Abdullah remarked that foreign militants were engaged in reckless killings and mayhem {{in the name of}} religion.

25|$|The highest {{numbers of}} {{incidents}} and fatalities caused by Islamic terrorism occur in Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. In 2015 four Islamic extremist groups {{were responsible for}} 74% of all deaths from terrorism: ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, according to the Global Terrorism Index 2016. In recent decades, such incidents have occurred on a global scale, affecting not only Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also several countries within the European Union, Russia, Australia, Canada, Israel, India and the United States. Such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims.

25|$|Along with {{bombings and}} hijackings, Islamic <b>terrorists</b> <b>have</b> made {{extensive}} use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is decapitation, another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the Lebanese Civil War resulted in the 1986 Iranâ€“Contra affair. During {{the chaos of the}} Iraq War, more than 200 kidnappings foreign hostages (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the kidnapping of Alan Johnston by Army of Islam resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.|$|E
