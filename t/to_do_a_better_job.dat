IGN's Eric Goldman praised the episode, {{giving it a}} nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. He opined {{that it was his}} favorite episode since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and added that [...] "it had scary zombie scenes, good action, interesting character interaction and a revelation at the end that gave us a whole lot to process." [...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters. It needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of biding its time between crowd-pleasing zombie attacks." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow-burning character study {{in the context of a}} zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks who just want brain-eating action — and the characters need to be more complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E

In addition, 67% of men now strongly {{believe that it is}} unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model. To counter such issues, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts in including ‘real’ women, and reducing or banning the use of airbrushing tools. Despite the amount of feminist features in magazines though, “body fascism is [...] reinforced by the advertisements, fashion stories and beauty pages”. Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer’s self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labelling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. The strategy was based on research reporting the lowering of customer self-esteems and interests, in products with larger sizing labels.|$|E
