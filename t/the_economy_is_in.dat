2500|$|In 2006, BBC {{flagship}} news programme Newsnight featured Cuba's Healthcare {{system as}} part of a series identifying [...] "the world's best public services". The report noted that [...] "Thanks chiefly to the American economic blockade, but partly also to the web of strange rules and regulations that constrict Cuban life, <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a terrible mess: national income per head is minuscule, and resources are amazingly tight. Healthcare, however, is a top national priority" [...] The report stated that life expectancy and infant mortality rates are nearly the same as the USA's. Its doctor-to-patient ratios stand comparison to any country in Western Europe. Its annual total health spend per head, however, comes in at $251; just over a tenth of the UK's. The report concluded that the population's admirable health {{is one of the key}} reasons why Castro is still in power. A 2006 poll carried out by the Gallup Organization's Costa Rican affiliate — Consultoría Interdisciplinaria en Desarrollo (CID) — found that about three-quarters of urban Cubans responded positively to the question [...] "do you have confidence to your country's health care system".|$|E

50|$|The graph to {{the right}} shows this {{simplified}} case for the credit market. The interest rate is denoted by r, and S and I denote savings and investment respectively.

50|$|Quantitative easing {{increases}} {{reserves in}} the banking system (i.e., deposits of commercial banks at the central bank), giving depository institutions {{the ability to make}} new loans. Quantitative easing is usually used when lowering the discount rate is no longer effective because interest rates are already close to or at zero.

5000|$|Overqualification is {{the most}} common form of {{underemployment}} equilibrium and is a direct result of oversupply.

5000|$|Economists' {{views of}} {{economic}} indicators versus actual released data contribute to market volatility. A tight consensus is generally reflected in bond prices {{and there is}} little price movement in the market after the release of [...] "in-line" [...] data. If the economic release differs from the consensus view, the market usually undergoes rapid price movement as participants interpret the data. Uncertainty (as measured by a wide consensus) generally brings more volatility before and after a release. Economic releases vary in importance and impact depending on where <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the business cycle.|$|E
5000|$|John Maynard Keynes {{wrote in}} 1937: [...] "The boom, not the slump, {{is the right}} time for {{austerity}} at the Treasury." [...] In other words, the government should act to stabilize economic conditions, reducing the budget deficit when the economy is booming (or maintaining a surplus) and increasing the deficit (or reducing the surplus) when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> recession. The only fiscal years since 1970 when the U.S. had a budget surplus were 1998-2001, a combination of the booming 1990's economy and Clinton's higher tax rates. Economic stimulus (increasing the deficit) is done by lowering taxes or increasing spending, while the opposite is done for economic austerity.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{industries}} boom {{when the}} aggregate economy is prosperous and bust when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> recession. In other words, industry cycles of many industries {{in a given}} country are correlated with the business cycles of the country. [...] For other industries, mismatch and delay between different dynamics in markets is another important mechanism causing industry cycles. The Bullwhip effect at firm-level [...] and game-like competition at industry-level [...] can cause the sequential boom-bust movement in price, sales, capacity and investment in many industries. Finally, uneven pace of technology change appears to be another main driver of industry cycles as sales in an industry are likely to peak after a ‘dominant design’ has emerged.|$|E
