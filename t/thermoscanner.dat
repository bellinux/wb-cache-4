40|$|Understanding inter-observer {{variability}} in clinical diagnosis {{is crucial for}} reliability studies. As the statistical measurements of reliability, the kappa statistic and its extensions have been widely adopted in medical research, {{but it has been}} discussed that kappa is vulnerable to prevalence and presence of bias. As an alternative robust statistic, AC has attracted recent statistical attentions. This article describes fundamental ideas and quantitative features of AC. The reliability of infrared <b>thermoscanner</b> as an application in detecting febrile patients of pandemic influenza is discussed by means of Monte Carlo simulation. AC adjusts chance agreement more appropriately than kappa and is regarded as a more useful measurement for assessing inter-observer agreement, especially when prevalence is small. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the early}} stages of Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009, border control {{measures}} were taken by quarantine stations to block the entry of infected individuals into Japan and community containment measures were implemented to prevent the spreading. The objectives of this study were to describe these measures and the characteristics of infected individuals, and to assess the measures ’ effectiveness. Methodology/Principal Findings: Border control and community containment measures implemented from April to June (Period I: April 28 –May 21, Period II: May 22 –June 18) 2009 were described. Number of individuals identified and disease characteristics were analyzed. For entry screening, a health declaration form and an infrared <b>thermoscanner</b> were used to detect symptomatic passengers. Passengers indicated for the rapid influenza test underwent the test followed by RT-PCR. Patients positive for H 1 N 1 were isolated, and close contacts were quarantined. Entry cards were handed out to all asymptomatic passengers informing them about how to contact a health center in case they developed symptoms. Nine individuals were identified by entry screening and 1 during quarantine to have Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009. Health monitoring by health centers was performed in period I for passengers arriving from affected countries and in period II for those who had come into contact with the individuals identified by entry screening. Health monitoring identified 3 infected individuals among 129, 546 in Period I and 5 among 746 in Period II. Enhanced surveillance, which included mandatory reporting o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Entry {{screening}} {{tends to}} start with a search for febrile international passengers, and infrared <b>thermoscanners</b> have been employed for fever screening in Japan. We aimed to retrospectively assess the feasibility of detecting influenza cases based on fever screening as a sole measure. Methods Two datasets were collected at Narita International Airport during the 2009 pandemic. The first contained confirmed influenza cases (n = 16) whose diagnosis took place at the airport during {{the early stages of the}} pandemic, and the second contained a selected and suspected fraction of passengers (self-reported or detected by an infrared thermoscanner; n = 1, 049) screened from September 2009 to January 2010. The sensitivity of fever (38. 0 °C) for detecting H 1 N 1 - 2009 was estimated, and the diagnostic performances of the infrared <b>thermoscanners</b> in detecting hyperthermia at cut-off levels of 37. 5 °C, 38. 0 °C and 38. 5 °C were also estimated. Results The sensitivity of fever for detecting H 1 N 1 - 2009 cases upon arrival was estimated to be 22. 2 % (95 % confidence interval: 0, 55. 6) among nine confirmed H 1 N 1 - 2009 cases, and 55. 6 % of the H 1 N 1 - 2009 cases were under antipyretic medications upon arrival. The sensitivity and specificity of the infrared <b>thermoscanners</b> in detecting hyperthermia ranged from 50. 8 - 70. 4 % and 63. 6 - 81. 7 %, respectively. The positive predictive value appeared to be as low as 37. 3 - 68. 0 %. Conclusions The sensitivity of entry screening is a product of the sensitivity of fever for detecting influenza cases and the sensitivity of the infrared <b>thermoscanners</b> in detecting fever. Given the additional presence of confounding factors and unrestricted medications among passengers, reliance on fever alone is unlikely to be feasible as an entry screening measure. </p...|$|R
