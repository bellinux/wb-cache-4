5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he turns his head 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully arrive on the case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. All seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do {{with a plan to}} rob a major bank.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally the attire of the Igbo {{generally}} {{consisted of}} little clothing as {{the purpose of}} clothing then was to conceal private parts, although elders were fully clothed. Children were usually nude from birth till their adolescence (the {{time when they were}} considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide) but sometimes ornaments such as beads were worn around the waist for medical reasons. Uli body art was also used to decorate both {{men and women in the}} form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

Severance noted that [...] "I have a file of more than 60 people who claim <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the flags," [...] but confirmed that it was indeed Wood who brought the American flag to Iwo Jima.|$|R
500|$|Andy Orchard {{comments}} that the seeming appearance of Baldr with Volla in the Merseburg Incantation is [...] "intriguing" [...] since Fulla {{is one of}} the three goddesses (the other two being Baldr's mother Frigg and his wife Nanna) the deceased Baldr expressly sends gifts to from Hel. John Lindow says that since the name Fulla seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with fullness, it may also point to an association with fertility.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the midtempo piece [...] "I Just Want <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Do", which {{contains}} lyrics pertaining to ambivalence and anomie. In the song, Joey manages to rhyme [...] "Second Avenue" [...] with [...] "chicken vindaloo". The next track, [...] "I Wanted Everything", {{is compared to}} Merle Haggard's song [...] "If We Make It Through December", being called its [...] "punk counterpart" [...] by Rock: A Canadian Perspective author Larry Starr. [...] "Questioningly" [...] is a ballad focusing on failing relationships and heartbreak. [...] "Don't Come Close" [...] uses elements which can also be heard in country music, such as twang.|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad, credited for programming on the album, assisted in its production. He cited the group's fusion of hip hop production and live instrumentation for Sons of Soul as {{the inspiration for}} his subsequent work {{as a member of}} A Tribe Called Quest and The Ummah. Muhammad discussed his experience recording Sons of Soul in a 1998 interview, saying that [...] "I'd just hooked this beat up, and [...] picked up their instruments and started playing. Raphael was singing, {{and as soon as he}} touched the bass, it just blew me away." [...] Raphael Wiggins explained how they valued instrumentation when recording the album, saying that [...] "We want everyone <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> relate to; a drummer will get into the live drums and so on." ...|$|E

500|$|Berry {{graduated}} from Bedford High School {{where she was}} a cheerleader, honor student, editor of the school newspaper and prom queen. [...] She worked in the children's department at Higbee's Department store. She then studied at Cuyahoga Community College. In the 1980s, she entered several beauty contests, winning Miss Teen All American in 1985 and Miss Ohio USA in 1986. She was the 1986 Miss USA first runner-up to Christy Fichtner of Texas. In the Miss USA 1986 pageant interview competition, she said she hoped to become an entertainer or <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the media. Her interview was awarded the highest score by the judges. She was the first African-American Miss World entrant in 1986, where she finished sixth and Trinidad and Tobago's Giselle Laronde was crowned Miss World. According to the Current Biography Yearbook, Berry [...] "...pursued a modeling career in Chicago.... Berry's first weeks in New York were less than auspicious: She slept in a homeless shelter {{and then in a}} YMCA".|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah, who {{maintained}} a perfect 4.0 {{grade point average}} when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> fall back on." [...] She did this in her own life, as she planned to [...] "fall back on" [...] {{another part of the}} entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, [...] "when you pick a career it has to be something you love".|$|E
500|$|Along with Kaneko, series co-creator Kouji Okada {{produced}} the title. The game {{was directed by}} Katsura Hashino, his first time in such a position within the Megami Tensei series. While the option of making a direct sequel to Shin Megami Tensei II was considered, Kaneko wanted {{to return to the}} contemporary setting of the original Shin Megami Tensei as opposed to the science fiction aesthetic of its sequel. As it was felt that the game was more than just the third numeric installment, a subtitle was added. Before the final subtitle, [...] "Nocturne" [...] was added, other subtitles were considered. An early subtitle was Vortex. The game uses a third-person camera perspective rather than the first-person dungeon crawling of earlier installments. One of the reasons for this change was that the developers wanted to focus on the protagonist, who would stand out for being a half-demon. Another factor was many reports of people suffering from a condition similar to car sickness called [...] "3D sickness" [...] with first person shooters in Japan: the developers wanted players <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> focus their eyes on. Despite setting the game in contemporary Tokyo, the team chose a cel-shaded art style as they wanted their game to stand out and enable Kaneko to bring the game {{as close as possible to}} his original vision.|$|E

500|$|From October 2008, O'Meara, McIntosh, and Cattermole reunited {{and started}} {{performing}} in pubs and clubs across Britain. [...] This was shortly after O'Meara's son Lenny was born. On 12 November 2008, a bottle was thrown at O'Meara during an S Club 3 performance in Bradford; it {{left her with}} a severe cut to the head, requiring treatment at a nearby Hospital. A 20-year-old man was arrested, and the attack was thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with her performance on Celebrity Big Brother, where nearly 50,000 complaints were received about her and two other female contestants' apparent racist bullying toward Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. In late 2008, some sources stated that Barrett and Lee were to start touring with the group sometime in the following year. It was also stated that a new greatest hits album, Ain't No Party: The Ultimate Collection of S Club 7 was set for release later the following year. [...] Both of these rumours {{turned out to be}} false. Lee was pursuing his acting career along with Spearritt, Barrett was on hiatus, and Stevens was starring in Strictly Come Dancing. Cattermole was absent from a gig at the Plug Club in Sheffield in February 2009. On 12 November, S Club 3 turned on the Mansfield Christmas Lights. In early 2010, the group decided to take their gigs further. They booked some venues in Egypt for April. On 19 April 2010, S Club 3 were the headlining act at the Tottenham Carnival. The group made an appearance at Gay Prides in Doncaster and Yorkshire on 21 August.|$|E
500|$|After Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was released, Nomura {{wanted to}} expand Roxas' {{role in the}} series to explain the events between his birth and his {{disappearance}} from Organization XIII. For Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the staff thought that Roxas' role {{as a member of}} the group would be a suitable theme for the plot. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. Co-director Tomohiro Hasegawa explained that Roxas' was originally shorter, and the staff decided he should grow taller as the game continued to develop. Nomura wanted to portray Roxas' activities differently from Sora's. In Sora's games, he is on a journey around the world, while Roxas always returns to Organization XIII after each mission. The staff constructed Roxas' interactions with the Disney characters differently from Sora's, as the Organization was meant to be secret in the game's story. Nomura told the writers that he wanted Roxas to learn something from each of his missions or just <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> think about. Nomura later clarified that Roxas' personality was different from the one portrayed in Kingdom Hearts II, as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters. With Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Nomura wanted to reveal why Roxas left Organization XIII. Although Nomura found it a sad story, he considered Zack Fair's ending in [...] to be more tragic. Nomura felt Roxas' last words in the game were also the title's most significant, as he wanted them to connect to Kingdom Hearts IIs first scene, which is actually the same scene. Uchiyama expressed sadness when the game's development ended as he would not play the character for a long time.|$|E
500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{not known}} how the Jamts got their name. One {{possible}} explanation {{is presented in the}} Icelandic work Heimskringla from the 13th century. In the Saga of Håkon Góði, Snorri Sturluson narrates about Kettil Jamti, a son of Anund Jarl from Sparbu in Trøndelag who fled from Norway when Harald Fairhair united the country with brute force in the 9th century. His descendants then came to bear his name. An alternative explanation comes from the excessive iron production {{that took place in the}} province before the Viking age. A folk etymological theory is that the name ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the [...] "even" [...] (as in level or flat) parts around the lake Storsjön. This theory is based on the similarity between the Swedish words jämt (from emat-) and jämnt (from Germanic *ebna, [...] "even").|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{continued}} {{to pay the}} annual tribute to Virginia's governor. This consists of game, usually a deer, and pottery or a [...] "peace pipe". The Pamunkey have been paying such tribute since the treaty of 1646. Making this annual payment {{has not always been}} easy. Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. My dad was chief then, and we knew we had <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> present to the governor; so we went to a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it. That way we were able to fulfill the terms of the treaty--after all it was killed on the reservation." [...] As far as anyone knows, they have not missed a payment in 331 years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 Ella and Jesse {{played an}} early gig at the Violet Town Arts Festival, when Ella was 13 {{years old and}} Jess was 15. [...] This gig was {{supported}} by the future recipient of the 2001 C.A.S Hawker Scholarship and attorney Stephen Michelson. Ella later described their group as an [...] "acoustic, folky duo with an edge." [...] The name, Killing Heidi, came from using two lists, before their first gig: one filled with [...] "soft" [...] words (Heidi was selected), one with [...] "harsh" [...] words (Killing). Ella recalled in January 2015 that the name was [...] "a play on the end of innocence and embracing imperfection": it was chosen <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> fill in on the Unearthed entry form. Jamie Durrant of Benalla's Bent Records caught the festival gig and offered them time in his recording studio.|$|E
2500|$|To {{define their}} music, Pere Ubu {{coined the term}} avant-garage to reflect {{interest}} in both experimental avant-garde music (especially musique concrète) and raw, direct blues-influenced garage rock. Thomas has stated the term is [...] "a joke invented <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> give journalists when they yelp for a neat sound bite or [...] ". Their music has been called art-punk and post-punk. Their songs imagined 1950s and 1960s garage rock and surf music archetypes as seen in a distorting funhouse mirror, emphasising the music's angst, loneliness and lyrical paranoia. Sometimes sounding like a demented nursery rhyme sing-along, this already bizarre blend was overlaid with Ravenstine's ominous EML synthesizer effects and tape looped sounds of mundane conversation, ringing telephones or steam whistles. Their propulsive rhythmic pulse was similar to Krautrock, but Thomas's yelping, howling, desperate singing {{was and still is}} peculiar when compared to most other rock and roll singers.|$|E
