5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E
5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method of {{removing}} glasses {{from a human}} frontal facial image. We first detect the regions occluded by <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> and generate a natural looking facial image without glasses by recursive error compensation using PCA reconstruction. The resulting image has no trace of <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> frame or of the reflection and shade caused by <b>the</b> <b>glasses.</b> <b>The</b> experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method provides an effective solution to <b>the</b> problem of <b>glasses</b> occlusion and we believe that this method {{can also be used to}} enhance the performance of face recognition systems.

Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> factories located just outside the city. The products made include glass jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained glass windows, and glass lamps.

5|$|Because gallium wets {{glass or}} porcelain, gallium {{can be used}} to create {{brilliant}} mirrors. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in Galinstan glass thermometers), <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> must be protected with a transparent layer of gallium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven.

Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

And if when the Drop is in motion you lift up that end of <b>the</b> <b>Glasses</b> where they meet, and towards which the Drop moves, the Drop will ascend between <b>the</b> <b>Glasses,</b> and therefore is attracted. And as you lift up <b>the</b> <b>Glasses</b> more and more, the Drop will ascend slower and slower, and at length rest, being then carried downward by its Weight, as much as upwards by the Attraction.
