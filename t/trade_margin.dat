In the base case, costs were calculated based on the median price including VAT and the weighted average <b>trade</b> <b>margin</b> of theRussian Federationon given population. The cost of narlaprevir was calculated on the basis of estimated registration price including VAT and average <b>trade</b> <b>margin</b> on given population (price of registration – 98 000 RUB per pack 100 mg № 56). The sensitivity analysis evaluated the option of modifying the registered price of simeprevir and the estimated rates of narlaprevir registered price on 25 %, and took into consideration the auction prices in 2016. Results. In the base case costs on narlaprevir therapy 29, 9 % less compared with simeprevir (due to therapy with simeprevir failure after 4 weeks if lack of response). In the calculation of the full course of therapy, the savings increases to 38, 4 %. Analysis on prices of auctions also demonstrates the economic benefits of narlaprevir: estimated savings will account for 26, 7 % and 35, 7 % with and without allowance for failures with simeprevir in the absence of response after 4 weeks, respectively. Subgroup analysis shows that with any degree of fibrosis, narlaprevir allows reducing costs compared to simeprevir. Even in case of increasing the narlaprevir registration price and lower the simeprevir registration price compared to the baseline (in both cases – 25 %) cost of therapy with narlaprevir will be 1, 8 % lower compared with simeprevir. Thus, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated a high reliability of the obtained results in the baseline. Conclusions. Narlaprevir in combination with peg-INF + RBV will significantly decrease the cost of treatment of naïve patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis compared with the combination of simeprevir and therefore increase the availability of therapy.  </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I explore {{the effect of}} {{intellectual}} property rights (IPRs) on the composition of international trade. The model allows a new channel by which IPRs may affect welfare such that cross-country incentives are aligned even in the short run: the composition of trade. Because products are associated with different profit potential, firms make asymmetric export decisions {{when faced with the}} threat of imitation and its spillover effects into the home market. Cross-country incentives can be aligned as product imitators trade off gains from lower prices with losses due to less access to inelastically demanded varieties. The predictions of the model find empirical support in the data, where it is shown that a greater proportion of higher profit goods are exported to stronger relative to weaker IPR destinations. In the second chapter, we ask: how do IPR policies affect international trade? We consider two central results from the model in Chapter I: (i) that IPR reforms should expand the range of goods exported through the extensive <b>trade</b> <b>margin</b> and (ii) firms with more newly developed products should be more sensitive to IPR policies. Building the first comprehensive matched firm-level data set on destination-specific exports and patents, we first document a number of facts on the relationship between trade and innovation. We then document a significant positive relationship between whether a firm has a patent and its sensitivity to IPR policies in terms of its exports. Firms with more newly developed patents show a larger sensitivity to IPRs. Finally, in the third chapter, we analyze financial development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The financial sectors of Middle-Income Countries (MICs) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continue to evolve. Thus, this chapter investigates two questions: (1) how does financial inclusion compare to that of emerging economies and (2) how does financial inclusion impact financial stability? Our findings suggest: (i) individual financial access in SSA is comparable to EMs while SME financial access lags behind; (ii) SME financial access and/or individual savings enhances financial stability while individual credit-oriented financial inclusion undermines stability; and (iii) a more equity and deposit based funding structure enhances financial stability...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of narlaprevir and simeprevir in the CHC (genotype 1)  therapy in treatment-naïve patients and relapses. Material and methods. Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of simeprevir and narlaprevir was conducted from the perspective of {{the health care system}} and base on QUEST- 1, QUEST- 2, ASPIRE and PIONEER clinical trials. The relative risk of achieving SVR 24 compared to the peg-INF + RBV therapy was used in the model.  Treatment discontinuation in patients receiving narlaprevir assumed {{in the absence of a}} SVR after 12 weeks and in patients receiving simeprevir in the SVR absence after 4  weeks.  The cost of narlaprevir was calculate based on estimated registration price in case of EDL (essential pharmaceutical list approved by MOH) inclusion, including VAT (10 %) and  10 % as <b>trade</b> <b>margin.</b> Costs of other antiviral products were in line with the results of 2015 average auctions prices. Results. In the base case costs on antiviral products with narlaprevir as first-line therapy are lower compared with simeprevir by 12, 2 % (950, 6 and 1083, 0 thousand RUR, respectively), and the cost per patient with SVR 24 by 7, 8 %. In patients group after relapse costs on antiviral products with narlaprevir as first-line therapy will decrease compared with simeprevir by 4, 3 % (971, 3 and 1014, 7 thousand RUR, respectively), and the cost per patient with SVR 24 by 25, 0 %.  The sensitivity analysis demonstrated a high reliability of obtained results. Thus, assuming equal clinical effectiveness of narlaprevir and simeprevir, costs of treatment naive patients will be 10. 6 % lower for narlaprevir group compared to simeprevir group (953, 0 and 1066, 0 thousand rur, respectively), and by 12, 9 % for the treatment of relapses (957, 9 and  1100, 0 thousand RUR, respectively). Conclusions. With comparable clinical efficacy and tolerability of narlaprevir and simeprevir both in treatmentnaïve patients and patients with relapse after therapy, which included PEGylated interferon and ribavirin, narlaprevir reduces the burden on the budget.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 - IntroductionWith increasing urbanization {{and subsequent}} population density in {{cities in the}} era of globalization and global economic integration, providing a public transportation system which is efficient, effective, safe and inexpensive leads to economic, social and environmental sustainability. So that other indicators such as travel time, traffic, fuel consumption and air pollution be improved, in addition to the current direction of traveling towards public transportation. BRT system is one of the forms of mass transit which had been designed and implemented in order to solve urban traffic problems and move toward sustainable urban development. In this way, planners and policy makers are still interested in investing in a transportation network and density of lands as an alternative to eliminate private cars, reduce traffic and its adverse effects. This paper investigates and evaluates the effects of BRT system on commercial land uses of street margin, in Tabriz from university square to Shariati cross- road. 2 - MethodologyThe sample size of the study includes all economic businessmen of the margin of street in the studied area in Tabriz in 2010 - 2011. The statistical sample of the survey was selected according to the random sampling method. There were 180 commercial land uses; with special separation of the main junction 75 questionnaires were returned and analyzed from {{the north side of the}} street and 75 ones were returned and analyzed from the south side of the street and the questionnaire return rate was 83 percent. In this study, interview method had also been used. 3 - Discussion BRT lines in Tabriz were designed to solve traffic problems and transportation. But regardless of its influential effects on the transport of Tabriz, adverse effects had been imposed on <b>trade</b> <b>margin</b> land uses in the studied area. In the area of study, due to the narrow width of passage, BRT line had allocated in one side of the street and other side of streets had been allocated to moving and handling personal vehicles that has led to slow movement and increase in volume of traffic. This resulted in the decrease of customers referring to shop across these lines, because people who want to buy goods and commodities from these places were no longer willing to go to these places and purchase goods from the North side of the street, due to various problems such as lack of parking places for private cars, preventing marginal park in the avenues, problems caused by going through the width of streets, waste of time and so on. Also, following to the investigations made, many shop owners and even some of the pedestrians have mentioned the BRT lines as a barrier wall. In the studied area, due to the narrow width passages, BRT line has allocated almost one side of the street and the rest of streets have been allocated to moving and handling personal vehicles that has resulted in slow movement and an increase in the volume of traffic. Besides BRT, other factors as well had affected sales and rents of shops. Some of them include: pavement design and its width, distance from trading centers or in other words, city's pedestrianism center, presence or absence of parking possibility for customers' cars, distance from government and official land use due to occupied passageways, the accumulation of shops in a bunch, price of shops, shops and distance from bus stops. In addition, based on the evaluation of the questionnaire results and interview with the local shopkeepers, this is clearly observable that the effect degree is not identical in North and South streets. 4 - ConclusionApart from the market stagnancy and economic problems, BRT lines have negative effects on commercial land use, especially at the price of rents and the number of stores' clients. In general, the results point to a real recession and application changes of land uses in the north side of street (the margins of BRT Line) which is more than the south side of street and following these changes, the owners of the shops in north street and those who want to invest tend to use the shops of Southern part. Based on our investigation, most shop owners and even some of the pedestrians had mentioned the BRT lines as a barrier wall. 5 - SuggestionsBased on the results of this research, it can be seen that following each step in the process of urban management many lateral and hidden feedbacks are visible which point to a multi-dimensional and chained link among the elements and parts of a city. In this regard, there is a need for a planning based on comprehensive approach and a system such as strategic planning to organize urban planning and management system in a way that it enables us to control and monitor feedback from the urban plans. Hence, according to current investigations, executive suggestions are as follows: Construction of parking within the scope of target services; Reducing the distance between stations;Tax relief for the losses;Other policies that attract citizens to the target locations such as the provision of green spaces, parks and other urban lively spaces in the target scope;And finally, if possible, transferring BRT route to the middle line of the street.

With respect to <b>trade</b> <b>margins,</b> our approach is based on the use-side procedure from the ESA- 95 Input-Output Manual (Eurostat, 2002) and is also being applied to the forthcoming 2000 Andalusian Input-Output Framework. Input-output analysis, use and make matrices, <b>trade</b> <b>margins,</b> National Accounts...|$|R
40|$|The <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> (or {{distributive}} margins) matrix {{represents one}} of the most relevant aggregate in a input-output framework. Consequently, the distributive margin is a typical issue of National Accounts, where the trade service is quantified by the differences between the value of the sales and the value of purchases of goods for resale. In this paper we describe the principal steps of the procedure for the construction of this matrix for Italy. The proposed methodology is founded on the business statistics approach and tries to answer to the question “who sell what and to whom?”. The data collected from the enterprises, at a very detailed level of classification, provide a good representation of the “distributive channels ” (e. g. supermarkets, traditional grocery stores) but it needed an integration with information related to the economic destination of products (householders, enterprises, etc.) and to the different products sold by each commercial firm. Using the <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> matrix we can reconstruct all the transactions from the production to the consumption of a good (the trade filières). For this reason, the <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> matrix is also a very important tool for the economic analysis...|$|R
