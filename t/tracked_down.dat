Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often <b>tracked</b> <b>down</b> and killed.|$|E
5|$|Chief Tenaya and his Ahwahneechee were {{eventually}} captured and their village burned; they were removed to a reservation near Fresno, California.

Near Mono Lake, they took refuge with the nearby Mono tribe of Paiute. They stole horses from their hosts and moved away, but the Mono Paiutes <b>tracked</b> <b>down</b> and killed many of the Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya.
