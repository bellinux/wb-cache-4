5|$|Major modern {{economic}} statistics, such as {{unemployment and}} GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> other factors.|$|E
30|$|This paper also {{focuses on}} {{different}} types of interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> government bond <b>markets</b> in the same region. First, the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bond <b>markets</b> in the same region {{is much more important}} than the interdependence across different regions (Baur and Lucey 2009). Second, the paper investigates the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bond <b>markets</b> in 39 countries. The samples already cover approximately 80 % of the global GDP, and therefore, it can be concluded that this paper’s analysis is reliable. The interdependence across different regions may result in an overly complicated analysis. In addition, over recent years the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bond <b>markets</b> has become quite valuable because the debt crisis {{is one of the most}} important parts in the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. The financial derivatives or the real estate markets are less liquid and important than government bond markets in most of the emerging markets. Thus, in this paper, our analysis emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bond markets in 39 countries.|$|R
30|$|In the {{robustness}} test, the crisis period is defined using data and statistics {{instead of the}} pre-decided definition, which makes the estimation of Formula (2) more significant. In addition, the directions of the coefficients {{are consistent with the}} previous results. To be specific, in most of the developed markets, the flight to quality occurred between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short-term government bond markets. However, in the emerging markets, there was little flight to quality evident between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short-term government bond markets. In certain emerging Asian markets, the flight to quality was seldom evident between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term government bond markets. Second, {{with the exception of the}} developed American market, there is significant negative spillover between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term government bond markets. This is in line with the previous conclusions.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, {{using the}} Markov-switching method, this work tests whether the {{interdependence}} between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bond markets {{occurred during the}} Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. A sudden increase in correlations during the crises would prove significant interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bond markets. Secondly, this work clarifies all kinds of interdependence by measuring the flight to quality, the flight from quality, the negative spillover and the positive spillover {{in conjunction with the}} different changing directions of interdependence. This work also summarizes the features of interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> government bond <b>markets</b> in various regions. Lastly, the characteristics of the interdependence in the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis are also mentioned, respectively.|$|R

25|$|Professors Andrew W.

25|$|The {{economic}} reforms were mainly intended {{to rescue the}} capitalist system by providing a more rational framework in which it could operate. The banking system was made less vulnerable. The regulation of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> the prevention of some corporate abuses relating to the sale of securities and corporate reporting addressed the worst excesses. Roosevelt allowed trade unions {{to take their place}} in labor relations and created the triangular partnership between employers, employees and government.|$|E
30|$|Compared to the {{long-term}} government bond market, the flight to quality between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short-term government bond markets is more significant.|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{no matter}} whether a crisis period or non-crisis period is in progress, the {{coefficients}} of long-term government bonds remain negative in most regressions, which shows that investment in long-term government bonds is strongly related to the prosperity of both the local economy <b>and</b> financial <b>markets.</b> During financial crisis periods, the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> long-term government bond markets is still similar to the interdependence in the non-crisis periods. The interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term government bond markets is often negative due to different risk patterns.|$|R
25|$|This was {{generally}} well received by both <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> the media.

The aim would be to increase sales revenue by £2.5billion by the financial year ending March 2008. Another significant announcement was the halving of the dividend to increase funds available for price cuts and quality.|$|E
25|$|Bache {{demonstrated}} {{that it would}} remain a major presence on Wall Street in the Crash of 1929 by reducing the credit extended to the firm's customers and warning them {{of the possibility of}} a reversal. Fortuitously, the firm had none of its own capital invested in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> had no investment trusts to protect during the markets decline. In the dark days of the Bank Holiday in 1933, when cash was virtually unavailable, Bache attracted national attention by supplying currency to customers in New York, Detroit, and other cities.|$|E
25|$|Exchange-traded {{funds that}} invest in bonds are known as bond ETFs. They thrive during {{economic}} recessions because investors pull their money out of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> into bonds (for example, government treasury bonds or those issued by companies regarded as financially stable). Because of this cause and effect relationship, the performance of bond ETFs may be indicative of broader economic conditions. There are several advantages to bond ETFs such as the reasonable trading commissions, but this benefit can be negatively offset by fees if bought and sold through a third party.|$|E
30|$|The primary {{result in}} this paper {{is that there are}} the {{significant}} instances of flight to quality and the negative spillover in the European Debt Crisis and the Subprime Crisis. Furthermore, the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bond <b>markets</b> in these recent crises is classified and the characteristics are summarized according to region. Compared to existing studies, our analysis is based on a rich dataset that includes <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bond markets in 39 countries around the world. Lastly, a general implication is provided for the characteristics of interdependence in the recent two global financial crises.|$|R
30|$|In {{regards to}} {{interdependence}} between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bond {{markets in the}} same country, the flight to quality often occurs in developed markets while the negative spillover often appears in the emerging markets.|$|R

25|$|Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{there was}} no {{regulation}} of securities at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data. To avoid another Wall Street Crash, the Securities Act of 1933 was enacted. It required the disclosure of the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, the names and compensations of corporate officers, about firms whose securities were traded. Additionally those reports had to be verified by independent auditors. In 1934 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was established to regulate <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> prevent corporate abuses relating to the sale of securities and corporate reporting.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{insurance}} products and practices {{have been described}} as rent-seeking by critics. That is, some {{insurance products}} or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under United States tax law, for example, most owners of variable annuities and variable life insurance can invest their premium payments in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.|$|E

Television ads highlighting the effort, as well as one portraying his family in gushing terms and showing him shirtless, received a poor public response and were a factor in his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien, leading in the polls as late as mid-October. He responded with ads that accused O'Brien of being a failed watchdog for state pension fund losses in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> that associated her husband, a former lobbyist, with the Enron scandal. These were effective in capturing independent voters. O'Brien said that Romney's budget plans were unrealistic; the two also differed on capital punishment and bilingual education, with Romney supporting the former and opposing the latter.|$|E
