25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>light</b> they can see {{is at the top}} of the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.|$|E
25|$|The DART {{light rail}} system {{remained}} <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>light</b> rail system in Texas until Houston opened METRORail, its starter {{light rail system}} (one line running less than 10 miles), in 2004. Fort Worth's smaller public transit system connects with Dallas's via a commuter rail line, the Trinity Railway Express, connecting downtown Dallas's Union Station with downtown Fort Worth's T Station and several points in between. The system of light rail transit, especially through downtown, has skyrocketed land values and has sparked a residential living boom in downtown. Although the system is increasingly popular, {{most people in the}} Metroplex live outside the service area of the system and, thus, rely on the automobile to get around.|$|E
25|$|From 1 July 1965, Oslo Sporveier {{took over}} the {{operation}} of the Simensbråten Line, which was numbered Line 16. Oslo Sporveier took over all employees and rolling stock, but Ekebergbanen remained a holding and real estate company. Immediately following the take-over, Oslo Sporveier introduced a 20-minute headway and suggested that the line be closed and replaced by buses from 29 October 1967, when the Østensjø Line of the metro opened. Following the closing of Sagene Ring, there were increased protests against closing the tramway. Traffic had decreased on the Ekeberg Line, but proponents for keeping it stated that this was because Oslo Sporveier had reduced the frequency and moved the end station out of the core of the city center. When the proposal to close the Ekeberg Line was considered by the city council, it was decided that only the Simenbråten Line was to be closed. The Simensbråten Line is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>light</b> rail line in Oslo to have been closed. It was replaced by a bus route that went up {{the other side of the}} hill, and did not correspond with the Ekeberg Line.|$|E

The columnist for OhWord.com wrote: [...] " [...] narrative voice swerves between personas that are cynical and optimistic, naïve and world-weary, enraged and serene, globally conscious and provincial". Music writer Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork describes the [...] "enduring image" [...] often associated with Nas's narrated stream of consciousness: [...] " [...] baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>light</b> is the orange glow of a blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation.

[...] Critic and blogger Kenny Waste comments on the significance of Queensbridge as a setting in Illmatic, writing, “The songs are made up largely of recollections or Nas describing his emotions, which range from feeling trapped to overt optimism about his abilities to escape the 'hands of doom'.

A [...] long road, called Chapel Avenue, led east from the chapel to the cemetery's eastern boundary. [...] A fountain (never built) was to anchor the eastern end of the road. The chapel itself was a Gothic Revival-style structure constructed of sandstone, with an interior measuring just [...] square. Simple wooden pews faced forward, providing seating for between 80 and 90 persons. The chapel had a single above-ground story, with a full basement which served as a receiving vault. Coffins placed on the dais could be lowered into the receiving vault below mechanically. Narrow bunk-like racks provided space for the storage of coffins and human remains until the spring thaw. Up to 30 coffins could be stored in the receiving vault. Four narrow metal tubes rose from the basement through the north and south roofs to provide ventilation. The building was unheated, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>light</b> was provided by small dormer windows set high in the roof.|$|E

Six brigades of field artillery were available for the creeping barrage and the division's three machine-gun companies were reinforced by a company from the 29th Division for the machine-gun barrage.

In fact, the new trains were so heavy ( [...] more than the Boeing LRVs they replaced) that some homeowners, claiming that the exceptional weight of the Breda cars damaged their foundations, sued the city of San Francisco. The Breda cars are longer and wider than the previous Boeing cars, necessitating the modification of subway stations and maintenance yards, as well as the rear view mirrors on the trains themselves. [...] Furthermore, the Breda cars do not run in three car trains, like the Boeing cars used to, as doing so had, in some instances, physically damaged the overhead power wires. [...] The Breda trains were so noisy that San Francisco budgeted over $15 million to quiet them down, while estimates range up to $1 million per car to remedy the excessive noise. [...] To this day, the Breda cars are noisier than the PCC or Boeing cars. In 1998, NTSB inspectors mandated a lower speed limit of , down from , because the brakes were problematic.|$|E
