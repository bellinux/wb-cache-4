40|$|Future {{wireless}} communication systems {{are required to}} meet growing demands for high spectral e�ciency, low energy consumption and high mobility. The advent of wireless network coding (WNC) has o�ered a new opportunity to improve network throughput and transmission reliability by exploiting interference in intermediate relays. Combined with network coding and self-information cancelation, WNC for two-way relay channels (TWRCs) {{has come to the}} forefront. This dissertation focuses on exploiting WNC in multi-hop two-way relay channels (MH-TRCs). Particularly, a multi-hop wireless network coding (MH-WNC) scheme is designed for the generalized L-node K-message MH-TRC. Theoretical studies on the network throughput and performance bounds achieved by the MH-WNC scheme with di�erent relaying strategies (i. e., amplify-and-forward (AF) and compute-and-forward (CPF)) are carried out. Furthermore, by introducing di�erent numbers of <b>transmission</b> <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> into the MH-WNC, a multiple-time-interval (Multi-TI) MH-WNC is proposed to determine an optimal MH-WNC which can achieve the best outage performance for all-scale MH-TRCs. Finally, this study extends the research on WNC one step forward from two-user networks to multi-user networks. An extended CPF joint with a dominated solution for maximizing the overall computation rate is proposed for the multi-way relay channel (mRC) in the last chapter. The contributions of this dissertation are multifold. First, the proposed MHWNC scheme with fixed two <b>transmission</b> <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> can achieve a significantly improved network throughput compared to the non-network coding (Non-NC) scheme in the generalized L-node K-message MH-TRC. Theoretical results are derived for both multi-hop analog network coding (MH-ANC) and multi-hop compute-and-forward (MH-CPF). Moreover, both theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the two MH-WNC schemes can be applied to different scale MH-TRCs to achieve a better outage performance compared to the conventional Non-NC scheme (i. e., MH-ANC for the non-regenerative MH-TRC with a small number of nodes, and MH-CPF for the regenerative MH-TRC with a large number of nodes.). Furthermore, a Multi-TI MH-WNC scheme is generalized with a special binary-tree model and characteristic matrix. The determined optimal MH-WNC scheme is able to provide the best outage performance and outperform the Non-NC scheme in all scale MH-TRCs. Last but not least, this dissertation provides a preliminary investigation of WNC in mRCs. The proposed dominated solution for maximizing the overall computation rate can ensure that all the nodes in the mRC successfully recover their required messages. Moreover, the extended CPF strategy is proven superior to Non-NC in the mRC with a small number of users. ...|$|R
