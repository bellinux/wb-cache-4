5|$|Along {{with the}} 110-floor Twin Towers, {{numerous}} other buildings at the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center),</b> 4 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> 5 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007. The two {{buildings of the}} World Financial Center also suffered damage.|$|E
5|$|The former Twin Towers of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> {{were located}} in Lower Manhattan. At , the 110-story {{buildings}} were the world's tallest from 1972 until they were surpassed by {{the construction of the}} Willis Tower in 1974 (formerly known as the Sears Tower, located in Chicago). One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> a replacement for the Twin Towers of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} the International Trade Mart {{launched}} {{the formation of a}} worldwide league of <b>trade</b> <b>centers,</b> which led to the founding of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Centers</b> Association. The World <b>Trade</b> <b>Centers</b> Association now comprises more than 300 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Centers</b> in nearly 100 countries.|$|R

Muse (Muse, Burma), the biggest border <b>trading</b> <b>center</b> along the Myanmar China border and Tachileik, another important <b>trading</b> <b>center</b> between Myanmar and Thailand are in Shan State.|$|R
5|$|The new World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex will {{eventually}} include five high-rise office buildings built along Greenwich Street, {{as well as}} the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> where the original Twin Towers stood. The construction of the new building is {{part of an effort to}} memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipping}} and receiving ramp, which served the entire World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex, occupied the eastern {{quarter of the}} 7World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> footprint. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp. The spray-on fireproofing for structural steel elements was gypsum-based Monokote, which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and trusses, and a three-hour rating for columns.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the original World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> there was debate regarding the future of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site at that time.|$|E
50|$|Hale Mirowskie (Mirów's Halls, {{formerly}} Trade or Marketplace Halls - Hale Targowe) are <b>trade</b> <b>centers</b> (halls) {{constructed in}} 1899-1901 in Mirów district in Warsaw. Until their destruction during Warsaw Uprising in 1944 {{they were the}} largest <b>trade</b> <b>centers</b> in Warsaw. They were rebuilt {{in the period of}} 1950s-1960s and restored to their original function as <b>trade</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX), {{formerly}} the Hanoi Securities <b>Trading</b> <b>Center</b> (Hanoi STC) located in Hanoi, Vietnam, {{was launched in}} March 2005 and handles auctions and trading of stocks and bonds. The Hanoi STC was renamed in 2009 to the Hanoi Stock Exchange. It was the second securities <b>trading</b> <b>center</b> to open in Vietnam after to Ho Chi Minh City Securities <b>Trading</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, {{combined}} {{market capitalization}} of both Ho Chi Minh City Securities <b>Trading</b> <b>Center</b> and Hanoi Securities <b>Trading</b> <b>Center</b> is 14 billion US dollars, or 22.7% GDP of Vietnam.|$|R
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex, One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site, One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

5|$|The complex {{initially}} {{failed to}} attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous financial condition eased, after which {{an increasing number of}} private companies—mostly financial firms related to Wall Street—became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> included The Mall at the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald, and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The damaged {{section of}} the Pentagon was rebuilt and {{occupied}} {{within a year of}} the attacks. The temporary World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> PATH station opened in late 2003 and construction of the new 7World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> was completed in 2006. Work on rebuilding the main World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site was delayed until late 2006 when leaseholder Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed on financing. The construction of One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> began on April 27, 2006, and reached its full height on May 20, 2013. The spire was installed atop the building at that date, putting 1 WTC's height at 1,776 feet (541m) and thus claiming the title of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. One WTC finished construction and opened on November 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and {{had a significant effect}} on global markets, resulting in the closing of Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks. Cleanup of the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site was completed in May 2002, and the Pentagon was repaired within a year. On November 18, 2006, construction of One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> began at the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> site. The building was officially opened on November 3, 2014. Numerous memorials have been constructed, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|A WoodSearch Films short-subject {{documentary}} entitled How {{does it feel}} to work on One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center?</b> was uploaded to YouTube on August 31, 2010. It depicted {{construction workers}} who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site. However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center,</b> including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E
