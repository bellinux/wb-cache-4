5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and leaped happily at her. Also in <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
