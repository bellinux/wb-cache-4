In developing transit connectivity solutions, researchers often employ a range of study instruments, such as stated-preference surveys, focus groups, and pilot programs. To better understand response to one innovative transit solution, the authors employed a number of research tools, including: a longitudinal survey, field test, and pilot program. The innovation examined was a commuter carsharing model, called CarLink, which linked short-term rental vehicles to transit and employment centers. Over several years, researchers explored user response to the CarLink concept, a field operational test (CarLink I), a pilot program (CarLink II), and a commercial operation (the pilot {{was turned over to}} Flexcar in summer 2002). This multi-staged approach provided an opportunity for researchers to learn and adapt as each phase progressed.

50|$|Prior to the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 and the {{establishment}} of the Highway Trust Fund, roads were financed directly from the General Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury. The 1956 Act directed federal fuel tax to the fund to be used exclusively for highway construction and maintenance. The Highway Revenue Act mandated a tax of three cents per gallon. The original Highway Revenue Act was set to expire at the end of fiscal year 1972. In the 1950s the gas tax was increased to four cents. The 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act, approved by President Ronald Reagan in January 1983, increased the tax to nine cents with one cent going into a new Mass <b>Transit</b> <b>Account</b> to support public transport.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{automobile}} is {{the dominant}} travel mode throughout the U. S., while <b>transit</b> <b>accounts</b> for less than fourpercent of market share. Between these principal modes, niche markets exist for other transportation services, such as transit feeder shuttles and carsharing. Commuter-based carsharing, in which individuals share a fleet of vehicles linked to transit, could potentially fill and expand one such niche, complement existing services, and develop into an economically viable transportation alternative. While most transit shuttles rely heavily upon governmental support, carsharing {{has the potential to}} become commercially sustainable. In 1999, the first U.

Positive program response {{led to the development of}} CarLink II—a larger, more in-depth exploration of the commuter model. Program differences include: an increase from 12 to 27 vehicles; a shift from one employer to many; a move from the Dublin/Pleasanton region to the South San Francisco Bay area; integration of seamless carsharing technologies; and an emphasis on economic viability.

40|$|The {{automobile}} {{accounts for}} more than 95 percent of all person miles traveled in the United States, whereas <b>transit</b> <b>accounts</b> for less than 3 percent of all trips. Between the private automobile and traditional transit, niche markets exist for other transportation services, such as airport and transit feeder shuttles and carsharing. Commuter-based carsharing, by which individuals share a fleet of vehicles linked to transit, could potentially fill and expand one such niche; complement existing services, mainly transit and feeder shuttles; and develop into a viable transportation alternative. A brief overview is presented of transit feeder services, particularly in Northern California. The CarLink I field test is described—a commuter-based carsharing model developed and tested in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1999. Key behavioral findings arte highlighted. Recommendations are made for strengthening the viability of this innovative service, mainly on the basis of experience from the CarLink I field test. Empirical evidence suggests that CarLink could be sustainable if certain conditions exist: strong cooperation with local businesses and transit is established; parking limitations and congestion are prevalent; system feasibility is demonstrated; incentives are used (e. g., preferred parking and transit pass subsidies); higher user fees are generated; and technology and management costs are lowered. Further, CarLink’s long-term potential and viability could be strengthened by a combination of approaches, including cost reduction strategies, policy incentives, linkages to other complementary services (e. g., ridesharing), and local program support (e. g., demonstration grans) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for analyzing drive-access transit at a regional level is developed in this research. This framework is intended primarily for in-house use by regional transit agencies, yet {{has implications for}} the regional community at large. This framework serves {{as a tool for}} understanding and communicating what drive-access transit is, its significance to the regional transportation system, and the behavior of regional drive-access transit users. This framework emphasizes the utilization of GIS technology for both the analysis and communication of information relating to drive-access transit. It also focuses scholarly attention on drive-access transit in general and on kiss-and-ride in particular. The framework is applied to the Boston Metropolitan Region as a primary case study. Data from a variety of regional sources are utilized. GIS technology is used to visualize drive-access transit's regional significance in terms of total ridership, mode share, and drive-access transit facilities' utilization rates. A sub-mode choice model and a station choice model are developed for both rapid transit and commuter rail drive-access transit users. These models depend on the CTPS Emme/ 2 network model and the MIT Boston Regional TransCAD network model for the rapid transit and commuter rail models, respectively. The MIT Boston Regional TransCAD network model is intended to support on-going research, {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis, as part of the collaborative MBTA/MIT transit research effort. As a result of the application of the analytical framework, key findings and specific recommendations related to drive-access transit are reported for the Boston Metropolitan Region. (cont.) Key findings include: · approximately 46 percent of the region's population lives beyond normal walking distance of transit services; * drive-access <b>transit</b> <b>accounts</b> for 69 percent of overall commuter rail ridership and 18 percent of overall rapid transit ridership; * drive-access <b>transit</b> <b>accounts</b> for 31 percent of rapid transit ridership in the 50 outermost rapid transit stations; * the MBTA has a significant investment in station parking facilities, parking fees represent an increasingly important part of the MBTA's operating budget, and parking fees in the region evidence no spatial correlation; * 71 percent of regional parking facilities reached 85 percent of capacity, many of them filling hours prior to the departure of the last morning peak train; * commuter rail station choice is dependent on access distance, parking capacities, and transit fares, with travelers willing to drive an extra mile if it results in savings of more than $ 0. 90 on their transit fare; * rapid transit station choice is dependent on access distance, parking capacities, and transit trip distances, with travelers willing to drive an extra mile if it results in transit trip reduction of more than 3. 3 miles; * sub-mode choice for both commuter rail and rapid transit users depends on access distance, automobile availability, and the number of vehicles owned per capita. Recommendations included: * Making drive-access transit and particularly kiss-and-ride a regional transportation priority. * Utilizing the developed models temporarily for modeling proposed services and policy implications until better data can be collected for a more complete model estimation process. (cont.) * Promote drive-access transit, especially kiss-and-ride and carpooling to parking stations, through targeting responsive demographic markets, and through incentives such as reduced transit fares, parking fees, or preferential parking treatment.

It is found that federal transit subsidy policy provides financial incentives for local decision-makers to select capital-intensive investment options that may not be efficient or effective. While federal financial incentives are not the only factor influencing local investment decisions, some reform of the current subsidy policy may be necessary to reduce the incentive for ineffective use of public resources. ...|$|R
