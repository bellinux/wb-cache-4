[...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and I think there is a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years." ...|$|E

"You Can't Win" [...] was {{originally}} written and performed during the pre-Broadway Baltimore {{run of the}} stage version of The Wiz in 1974, sung by the chorus of Winkies, the Wicked Witch's slaves. The number was cut from the musical before the official Broadway opening and wasn't performed again until the movie version was under consideration, 3 years later. [...] The producers resurrected the song as a solo for Michael Jackson to replace [...] "I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday", which had been Scarecrow's solo in the Broadway musical. [...] "You Can't Win" [...] and its corresponding scene in the movie allude to mistreatment of African Americans. Jackson stated in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that the lyrics to [...] "You Can't Win" [...] are about humiliation and helplessness, feelings, he stated, that many people have experienced {{at one point in}} their life. The singer added that the song was also about [...] "the feeling that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who don't actively hold you back as much as they work quietly on your insecurities so that you hold yourself back". [...] "You Can't Win" [...] opens with the lines, [...] "You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game. People keep sayin', things are gonna change, but they look just like they're staying the same." [...] William F. Brown, who wrote the book for the Broadway musical, stated that such verses made [...] "You Can't Win" [...] a [...] "black message song". Musically, the track has been described as an R, pop and soul song by Renée Graham of The Boston Globe. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80beats per minute. It adds that the song is composed in E with a range from B3 to C5.|$|E

D/Supt Robertson explained that the police were using new media for the first time in a murder investigation as they believed that many of those who knew Nelson were teenaged or younger and may not have wanted their parents to know where they were at the time or what they were doing. He reassured potential witnesses that: [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> underage drinking, I don't care.

There are certain schools of thought that only believe one thing. And if they don't remain open-minded about possibilities beyond what they know, then they're going to be lost.
