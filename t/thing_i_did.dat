500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} had {{a ripple}} effect, weakening Nickelodeon's commitment to Junktown. Bakshi has {{also stated that}} [...] "we were trying something different [...] but a series didn't make sense. It just didn't work". The series was scrapped, and the completed pilot aired as a special, Christmas in Tattertown, in December 1988. It was the first original animated special created for Nickelodeon. Bakshi moved into a warehouse loft in downtown Los Angeles to clear his head, and was offered $50,000 to direct a half-hour live-action film for PBS's Imagining America anthology series. Mark Bakshi produced the film, This Ain't Bebop, his first professional collaboration with his father. Bakshi wrote a poem influenced by Jack Kerouac, jazz, the Beat Generation and Brooklyn {{that served as the}} narration, which was spoken by Harvey Keitel. After a car crash, Bakshi completed the post-production in stitches and casts. Bakshi said of the work, [...] "It's the most proud I've been of a picture since Coonskin—the last real <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with total integrity." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did...</b> everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I got to Island was suggest we put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E

[...] In his third game as a freshman, Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback, and he remained Michigan's starter at the position for four years.|$|E

[...] The first concerns the Pooka MacPhellimey, [...] "a member of the devil class". [...] The second is about {{a young man named}} John Furriskey, who {{turns out to be a}} fictional character created by another of the student's creations, Dermot Trellis, a cynical writer of Westerns. [...] The third consists of the student's adaptations of Irish legends, mostly concerning Finn Mac Cool and Mad King Sweeney.|$|E
2500|$|While at {{the head}} of AMC, Chapin spearheaded the {{acquisition}} of Jeep from the Kaiser Motors Division of Kaiser Industries in 1970. According to Chapin: [...] "Perhaps the easiest decision I ever made was the purchase of Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. I tried to buy it when George Romney (later Michigan governor) and Roy Abernethy were running AMC. Romney and Edgar Kaiser couldn't get along. I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm. Where Jeep was, there were roads and gasoline. Abernethy didn't go for the idea and the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I became chairman and got a little money was to buy Jeep. We got it for a song, about $75 million..." [...] American Motors' engineers and designers quickly overhauled Jeep and expanded its lineup, creating a valuable asset that attracted Renault, Chrysler, and ultimately DaimlerBenz AG.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of several remixes of her songs by Steve [...] "Silk" [...] Hurley, Minogue became {{interested}} in dance music. She commented that the remixes were [...] "the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that was really cool and my love of dance music and clubbing started from there." [...] Minogue's interest in dance music and clubbing influenced her third album, Girl, released in September 1997, which featured collaborations with musicians such as Brian Higgins of Xenomania. The album presented a more sophisticated and adult style of dance music, but despite generally positive reviews, {{failed to make the}} British top 50. The lead single [...] "All I Wanna Do", which the Daily Mirror described as a [...] "bass-bumping, shuddering return", was a success peaking at number four on the UK singles chart. In her native Australia, the single also proved to be a success peaking at number eleven and was certified gold. The album's second single [...] "Everything I Wanted" [...] made the top 20 in the UK and the top 50 in Australia, while the third single [...] "Disremembrance" [...] narrowly missed the top 20 in the UK, peaking at number 21. All three singles released from Girl reached number one on the UK dance chart.|$|E

2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} these changes was that the lyrics on the album {{moved away from the}} overtly {{political}} lyrics of the early Scritti Politti EPs towards those that explored linguistics as a means of expressing personal politics and deconstructing the traditional love song. As Gartside explained, [...] "The problematic of language is present on the LP as an essential filter to each of the songs, dealing as most of them do with love and sexuality". He described [...] "The 'Sweetest Girl'" [...] as [...] "the tendency for things to fall apart in the light of political awareness", or as he put it more directly in another interview, [...] "It's got {{a lot to do with}} the promise and the myth and the cliché of the sweetest girl", or how the male idealised vision of the perfect girl was a myth, hence the inverted commas around the song's title (a subject and a grammatical trick he would later return to on the 1986 hit single [...] "The Word 'Girl'"). The song also alludes to [...] "the sickest group in all the world", which Gartside would later admit referred to the former bandmates and collaborators he had jettisoned from the early squat-punk collective days of Scritti Politti: [...] "We were a sick group for some time. I used to read and write a lot, which was the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> apart from being debauched... we were always pretty poorly".|$|E
2500|$|DJ Skee {{stated that}} after notifying Chris Brown and Usher and Boyz II Men, {{who at the}} time were in a {{recording}} studio, via a phone call, that they'd written and recorded the song overnight and gave him the song to play on June 26, 2009. [...] "Better on the Other Sides"s lyrics pertain to the influence of Jackson and his effect on people worldwide, as well as reflecting on their own personal memories of Jackson. In the song's lyrics Diddy opens the song with Jackson's influence in the lyrics [...] "I believed I can do anything," [...] he says. [...] "You made the world dance. You made the music come to life." [...] Brown's part of the song is the chorus, where he described the grief of Jackson's death and noting that [...] "I know it's better on the other side." [...] On The Game's verses he reflects on Jackson's influence on him growing up and comparing himself to Jackson. [...] Towards the ending on the song The Game claims that the feud between him and 50 Cent is over, presumably due to Jackson's death, [...] "First <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I heard was I called Puff. Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us, Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, and the young Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge." [...] After this line, Chris Brown then sings the chorus. Hinting that he is the [...] "young Mike Jackson." [...] However, their beef still continued until 2016, when it was squashed with 50 Cent saying [...] "What happened, that shit was 12 years ago." [...] The Outkast song Ms. Jackson is also referenced, referring to Jackson's mother, also saying [...] "your son was our king so we won't Coretta you". Diddy concludes the song by stating that while people's opinions of Jackson may vary, that he's going to [...] "remember the miracles that you showed us." [...] through Jackson's music, dancing, and philanthropy commenting that [...] "through us your legacy lives on, Mike Jackson." ...|$|E
