He further wrote that the listener is transported back when [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] was released. Simon Evans for musicOMH also compared the song to [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger", writing that they have the same [...] "defiance". Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic was brief in his review of the song, simply writing that it is a [...] "pretty good power ballad". Evan Chakroff for Stylus Magazine wrote that the song was forgettable, adding that while writing his review of the album, he could not remember the melody of [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". Victoria Segal for NME wrote a single review when it was released, and believed that it was difficult to take the song seriously. Segal wrote that it is a [...] "disappointing" [...] song that when [...] "looked at in the sober light of day, it's nothing but a lachrymose slur <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Noel Book Of Emotional Cliches and some truly shameless piano, but you just know that come closing time, it could make a breeze block cry".

Additionally, junior guard Caroline Doty {{would be out}} the entire season due to a third knee injury. [...] In an early test, UConn squeaked by #2 Baylor in their second game of the season. They powered their way through 8 more consecutive wins for their 88th straight victory, beating #10 Ohio State at Madison Square Garden. Their 89th win came at home against #20 Florida State to set the college basketball record for most consecutive wins, previously held by the UCLA men's team.

That game, however, was largely a warm-up match for their biggest test of the season, a December 30 matchup at the powerhouse Stanford Cardinal. UConn trailed for the entire game and lost {{for the first time since}} their April 6, 2008 Final Four appearance (also against the Cardinal). The loss ended the highly publicized winning streak, as well as their long held spot as the top ranked team in women's basketball which was taken over by Baylor.
