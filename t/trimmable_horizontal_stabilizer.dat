2500|$|According to the Technical Commission of the MAK, {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} the flight recorders indicated that the aircraft's <b>trimmable</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was set to 8.7 degrees [...] "nose up" [...] and its wing flaps were in the take-off position of 20 degrees. The engines were functioning until [...] "collision with obstacles." [...] According to Russia's aviation authority, the flight recorders gave no indication of sub-standard fuel.

After the crash, the airport ordered that no aircraft were to refuel there during the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|The Model 200 was {{originally}} conceived as the Model 101 in 1969, {{and was a}} development of the Model 100 King Air. The Model 200 had essentially the same fuselage as the Model 100, with changes to the rear fuselage to accommodate a new T-tail (in place of the 100's conventional tail with all-moving <b>trimmable</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer)</b> and structural changes to allow higher maximum pressurization. Apart from the T-tail, other changes included Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-41 engines rated at [...] instead of the [...] engines of the Model A100 then in production, and a wing of increased span and extra fuel capacity. Overall, the 200 was 3ft 10 in (1.17 m) longer than the A100, with wingspan 4ft 3 in (1.29 m) greater, containing [...] more fuel. Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) was increased by 1,000lb (450kg). After protracted development including extensive wind tunnel testing of the design (especially of the T-tail which was tunnel-tested for 375 hours), the first prototype flew {{for the first time}} on October 27, 1972; a second prototype took to the air on December 15 the same year. Three production aircraft were also built in 1972 and delivered to the U.S. Army; these three were designated Model A100-1s by Beechcraft and were given the military designation RU-21J; the first of some 400 T-tail King Airs to be ordered by the U.S. armed forces. The 200 received civil certification in December 1973 and the first civil delivery took place in February 1974.|$|E

25|$|Only two {{examples}} were constructed. The first {{was built by}} Bowlus and features an all-flying <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> The second was built by Frank Kelsey and has a fixed <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and flaps in addition to spoilers.|$|R

50|$|Direct law (DIR) {{introduces}} a direct stick-to-control surfaces relationship: control surface motion {{is directly related}} to the sidestick and rudder pedal motion. The <b>trimmable</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> can only be controlled by the manual trim wheel. All protections are lost, and the maximum deflection of the elevators is limited for each configuration as a function of the current aircraft centre of gravity. This aims to create a compromise between adequate pitch control with a forward C.G. and not-too-sensitive control with an aft C.G.|$|E
50|$|Investigators then {{inspected}} the flight controls of Flight 605, {{which were the}} rudder, the ailerons, the <b>trimmable</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> the flaps and slats, and several other flight controls. However, they didn't find any abnormalities on these controls. Control failure was ruled out from {{the cause of the}} crash. According to investigators, they also ruled out terrorism as the cause of the crash, as there were no sign of on board explosion during the approach and there were no evidence of explosives on board.|$|E
40|$|A Schweizer 1 - 36 {{sailplane}} {{was modified}} for a controlled, deep-stall flight program. This modification allowed the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> to pivot {{as much as}} 70 deg leading edge down. Ground vibration and flutter testing were accomplished on the sailplane with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> in the normal flight and deep-stall flight positions.

50|$|At 02:10:34 UTC, after {{displaying}} incorrectly {{for half}} a minute, the left-side instruments recorded a sharp rise in airspeed to 223 kn, as did the Integrated Standby Instrument System (ISIS) 33 seconds later (the right-side instruments are not recorded by the recorder). The icing event had lasted for just over a minute. The pilot continued making nose-up inputs. The <b>trimmable</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> (THS) moved from three to 13 degrees nose-up in about one minute, and remained in that latter position {{until the end of}} the flight.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} altitude, the autopilot then commanded a continuous nose-up movement of the <b>trimmable</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and the elevators. This resulted {{in an increase in}} the angle of attack of up to 24°, or 13° above the stall angle of attack in the event conditions, as well as the broadcast of several [...] "STABILIZER MOTION" [...] warnings. Both engines suffered a surge probably due to the plane's high angle of attack. Both engines RPM then decreased to values close to idle. This surge may have been noticed by the crew.|$|E

40|$|The {{permanently}} fast {{growth of}} airline market must {{not lead to}} rising numbers of accidents. To improve aircraft safety, pilot workload has to be reeduced especially in critical situations. This paper describes the system architecture of a new test rig to evaluate the iron bird to demonstrate its potential deals with the evaluation of a solution for reconfiguration: elevator failures are compensated by using a new <b>Trimmable</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Stabilizer</b> Actuator concept with higher dynamics, which can be integrated in modern airliners.

40|$|AbstractAircraft {{longitudinal}} control {{is the most}} important actuation system and its failures would lead to catastrophic accident of aircraft. This paper proposes an active fault-tolerant control (AFTC) strategy for civil aircraft with different numbers of faulty elevators. In order to improve the fault-tolerant flight control system performance and effective utilization of the control surface, <b>trimmable</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> (THS) is considered to generate the extra pitch moment. A suitable switching mechanism with performance improvement coefficient is proposed to determine when it is worthwhile to utilize THS. Furthermore, AFTC strategy is detailed by using model following technique and the proposed THS switching mechanism. The basic fault-tolerant controller is designed to guarantee {{longitudinal control}} system stability and acceptable performance degradation under partial elevators failure. The proposed AFTC is applied to Boeing 747 - 200 numerical model and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed AFTC approach...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Trimmable</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Stabilizer</b> Actuator (THSA system) equips {{the whole}} airbus line. One {{component}} {{of this system}} is a ball-screw system on which spalling problems appear on the balls. This phenomenon is mostly due to local high pressures and reduces the service life of the system. 3 D numerical simulations are usually used to tackle this kind of problems but are subjected to assumptions. As {{the aim of the}} project is to build a numerical model able to predict pressure distribution, these assumptions need to be experimentally assessed to be perfectly relevant of the real load distribution in the ball screw system. Due to the 3 D geometry of the specimen, a 3 D measurement technique, Scattered Light Photoelasticity (SLP), has been chosen to perform experimental measurements,. Because of complexity of the geometry, the study is divided in three steps; the present paper is dealing with the second one where a demonstrator ball-screw system is manufactured in casted epoxy to perform the SLP. This technique gives information on 3 D stress fields inside the epoxy specimen from the analysis of photoelastic fringes. They are compared to numerical ones and indicate whether numerical boundary conditions are relevant of the experimental ball-screw system behaviour...|$|E
