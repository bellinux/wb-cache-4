25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E

A sequel to the game, , was released in 2009. Playing as Mira, the daughter of the predecessor's antagonist, players discourage the growth of the kingdom while keeping adventurers from taking siege of her tower.|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2010, Rice {{publicly}} {{announced her}} {{disdain for the}} current state of Christianity on her Facebook page, stating, [...] "Today I quit being a Christian.... I remain committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed. I'm an outsider. My conscience will allow nothing else." [...] Shortly thereafter, she clarified her statement: [...] "My faith in Christ is central <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial to me. But following Christ does not mean following His followers. Christ is infinitely more important than Christianity and always will be, no matter what Christianity is, has been, or might become." ...|$|E

Hamilton said after the game: [...] "To score for my hometown team at Wembley {{has got to be}} one of the best feelings ever." [...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced I can get it here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and I was delighted to be part of them.

500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it back on my head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life!</b> I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E

500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> And I had written one, which was electronic music.

2500|$|In May 1978 Forster's first {{recorded}} work was the group's debut single, [...] "Lee Remick", {{which appeared in}} September. It was a paean to the Hollywood actress of the same name. Forster later recalled [...] "I didn't have a girlfriend or any sort of romantic side <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> ... I {{wanted to write a}} love song. But who was I in love with? No-one. I had to find someone and I found Lee Remick". He also wrote the B-side, [...] "Karen", as an ode to the university's library staff, [...] "here was kindness in the library, then you walk out of the library into the harsh real world". Forster then wrote their second single, [...] "People Say". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, both singles were [...] "sparsely produced, poorly played yet passionately performed folksy, post-punk pop songs. They were sunny, catchy and hopelessly romantic, earning the band immediate local and international acclaim".|$|E

Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
