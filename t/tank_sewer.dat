Ground water withdrawals in the United States make up roughly one-fifth of the total water use in the United States. For this reason, it is one of our most important resources which must be, protected from contamination. The occurrence of human enteric viruses in ground water, however, has been well documented. Viral contamination of ground water from septic <b>tank,</b> <b>sewer</b> line, or waste disposal site failures has lead to increased efforts to quantify the transport of viruses through the ground water. Ground water transport models can be used to predict the transport of viruses. However, if current public domain virus transport models are to be used for this purpose, they need to be verified under operating field conditions. To evaluate these models it is useful to use data from a "worst case scenario" for contaminant transport: a sand and gravel aquifer under a forced gradient. Field studies have been conducted to trace large-scale (34 in) and small-scale (10 in) virus transport under a forced gradient through the sand and gravel aquifer at the ground water research site and the Texas A&M Research Farm. Field instrumentation was developed to inject and monitor the virus tracer. Virus transport was monitored under natural and forced gradient conditions using MS- 2 and PRD- 1 bacteriophage as virus tracers and bromide as a conservative tracer. Simulations of the virus transport at the research site were also completed using the VIRALT virus transport model and parameters taken from past studies at the site. Results indicate virus and bromide transport in both the large and small-scale field tests, although comparison {{of the results of the}} two large-scale and the two small-scale was not consistent. These differences can be attributed to the heterogeneity of the sand and gravel aquifer at the site, different injection methods, and different sampling methods. The VIRALT simulations completed for virus and bromide transport at the site compared favorably with the field data...|$|E

40|$|Precipitation is {{the most}} active flux and major input of {{hydrological}} systems. Precipitation controls hydrological states (soil moisture and groundwater level), and fluxes (runoff, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge). Hence, precipitation plays a paramount role in urban water systems. It controls the fluxes towards combined <b>sewer</b> <b>tanks</b> and the dilution of chemical and organic compounds in the wastewater. Furthermore, small catchments (i. e., areas of about 20 ha) have a fast response to precipitation. Therefore, catchment average precipitation is a key component in urban water models.

40|$|Many small {{communities}} depend on groundwater sources for {{drinking water and}} they often use septic <b>tanks</b> for their <b>sewer</b> system needs. However, nitrates and other pollutants from septic systems can percolate to the aquifers and deteriorate quality of the groundwater, threatening the public health. This study has developed a groundwater model using Visual MODFLOW for an aquifer that {{is used as a}} water supply source for the cities of Beaumont and Cherry Valley, California. Septic systems are the suspected major source of nitrate contamination of the aquifer. The model has been developed to clarify the extent of interactions between nitrate pollutants, infiltration and percolation from a recently established series of artificial recharge ponds, groundwater recharge from natural sources, and pumping activities to meet local water uses. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate alternative hydraulic solutions that would limit the movement of the contaminants and minimize the risk of affecting the pumping wells. The study attempts to identify the best way to recharge the aquifer and influence movement of the nitrates so that polluted waters may have lower nitrate concentrations in the future, rather than allowed to encroach on critical production wells or led away from production wells to become a problem for future generations or neighboring areas. The data needed to build the model, including geological logs, precipitation, evapotranspiration, well locations, pumping schedules, water levels, and nitrate concentrations have been obtained from the Beaumont Cherry Valley Water District. The model has been calibrated to simulate the observed groundwater levels and the extent of pollution corresponding to the historical pumping rates, recharge rates and climate. The calibrated model has been used to evaluate alternative hydraulic solutions that would either localize the nitrate pollution thus limiting the impact on public welfare, or remove the nitrate pollution for potential treatment and remediation on the surface. The study results show that increased pumping of production wells or strategic placement of additional artificial recharge may reduce the concentrations of nitrate in the Beaumont Basin...|$|R
40|$|Fiji, an upper-middle income {{state in}} the Pacific Ocean, has {{experienced}} an increase in confirmed case notifications of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). To characterize the epidemiology of typhoid exposure, we conducted a cross-sectional sero-epidemiological survey measuring IgG against the Vi antigen of S. Typhi to estimate the effect of age, ethnicity, and other variables on seroprevalence. Epidemiologically relevant cut-off titres were established using a mixed model analysis of data from recovering culture-confirmed typhoid cases. We enrolled and assayed plasma of 1787 participants for anti-Vi IgG; 1, 531 of these were resident in mainland areas {{that had not been}} previously vaccinated against S. Typhi (seropositivity 32. 3 % (95 %CI 28. 2 to 36. 3 %)), 256 were resident on Taveuni island, which had been previously vaccinated (seropositivity 71. 5 % (95 %CI 62. 1 to 80. 9 %)). The seroprevalence on the Fijian mainland is one to two orders of magnitude higher than expected from confirmed case surveillance incidence, suggesting substantial subclinical or otherwise unreported typhoid. We found no significant differences in seropositivity prevalences by ethnicity, which is in contrast to disease surveillance data in which the indigenous iTaukei Fijian population are disproportionately affected. Using multivariable logistic regression, seropositivity was associated with increased age (odds ratio 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 2 to 1. 4) per 10 years), the presence of a pit latrine (OR 1. 6, 95 %CI 1. 1 to 2. 3) as opposed to a septic <b>tank</b> or piped <b>sewer,</b> and residence in settlements rather than residential housing or villages (OR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 7). Increasing seropositivity with age is suggestive of low-level endemic transmission in Fiji. Improved sanitation where pit latrines are used and addressing potential transmission routes in settlements may reduce exposure to S. Typhi. Widespread unreported infection suggests there may be a role for typhoid vaccination in Fiji, in addition to public health management of cases and outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms are {{responsible}} for more than 90 % of the reported waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States; enteric viruses, such as hepatitis A virus, are identified as causing almost 10 % of these. 	 However, in 50 % of the outbreaks, no causative agent is identified due to limitations {{in our ability to}} isolate and detect viruses in water samples. Historically, consumption of contaminated ground water has been the source of one-half of the reported outbreaks; in recent years, that fraction has risen to more than two-thirds. The most frequently reported source of contamination in these outbreaks is domestic sewage from septic <b>tanks,</b> leaking <b>sewer</b> lines, cesspools, etc. As a result of the continuing waterborne disease outbreaks, and the growing fraction of them associated with consumption of ground water, the USEPA is finalizing a regulation, the Ground Water Rule, to minimize the risk of acquiring a microbial illness from ground water. This regulation will require all public water systems that use ground water as a source to assess the potential for fecal contamination of the water. One potential source of fecal contamination is the reuse of recycled water. Even tertiary treated wastewater may contain contaminants, including disease-causing microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and parasites. Information about the numbers and types of some of these microorganisms, especially viruses, present in tertiary treated wastewater is scarce due to the limitations in the methods that are needed to detect these microorganisms in water. Current methods to detect viruses in water samples, for example, require highly specialized analytical facilities and at least two to four weeks to obtain results. In addition, the standard methods only detect one group of viruses, the enteroviruses (which includes polioviruses). From records on waterborne disease outbreaks in the U. S., it is known that the enteroviruses are not the major cause of reported viral waterborne disease; other viruses such as hepatitis A virus and caliciviruses are the public health concern. The lack of information about the presence of hepatitis A virus in water and its long survival times in water caused the USEPA to add it to the list of contaminants to be considered for regulation in drinking water. When recycled water is used to artificially recharge groundwater, there is the potential for some microorganisms, especially viruses due to their small size, to contaminate the underlying groundwater. Although most of the microorganisms may be removed during recharge, if even a few are transported to the ground water, that is of concern, as the USEPA has determined that one virus in 10, 000 liters of drinking water constitutes a public health concern. Molecular beacons (MB) are oligonucleotide probes that become fluorescent upon hybridization and are ideal in providing real-time monitoring of target amplicons during the PCR reaction. In this project, a real-time PCR assay based on molecular beacons was developed for the rapid and specific detection of hepatitis A virus. Using the MB-based RT-PCR assay, a detection limit of 1 PFU per PCR reaction was obtained. The specificity of the MB-based PCR assay was evaluated using a variety of other enteric organisms, and only hepatitis A virus was positively identified. The method developed in this study should improve our ability to provide rapid, sensitive, and specific results for the detection and quantitation of viruses in samples from environmental waters...|$|R
40|$|Prevention of sewer {{sediment}} accumulation, {{which can}} cause major sewer operational problems, is imperative and has been an immense concern for sewer designers. So far, researchers have mostly attempted to investigate the conditions where sewer systems can operate under self-cleansing condition, this way neglecting the essential attention {{that has to be}} addressed to sediment deposition patterns which occur in sewer reaches under various sewer geometrical and hydraulic conditions. To account for the effects of sediment formation in sewer systems, an appropriate sediment transport modelling with the ability to determine the location and depth of sediment deposit is needed. Besides, in order to prescribe proper solutions for the removal of the deposited layers these models need to appropriately analyse the in-sewer sediment transport patterns. In this regards, a validated numerical model incorporating shock-capturing TVD-McCormack scheme, developed in the University of Catania, Italy, is utilized in this research to help determine the sediment accumulation patterns in rectangular sewer channels, and to evaluate the sediment transport capacities that can be reached by implementing flushing devices and in particular the Giehl flushing tank (manufactured in Germany). Initially, the simulations are carried out to obtain the sediment bed deposition along the rectangular flumes (with geometries close to sewers) in stormwater sewer conditions (specifying a particular dry-weather period). This is followed by simulating the sediment heights after erosion by successive flushes in order to inspect the eroded sediment volume from the deposited bed and the cleaned channel lengths achieved by means of the applied flushes. Moreover, the sediment entrainment and bed-load transport due to flushing is also investigated in sewer channels with uniform bed layers under stormwater and combined sewer environments. It is discovered that in channels with widths up to 500 mm and sufficient bed slope (e. g. 20 , which might be the case in quite a number of stormwater sewer networks) 20 to 50 flushes by Giehl flushing tanks can lead to the erosion of deposited sediment layers with a length between 50 and 100 m. Besides, 50 successive flushes demonstrated sufficient capacity to completely erode up to (and possibly more than) a length of 20 m of a 4 cm thick uniform bed layer composed of medium grit particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 5 mm, in stormwater sewer channels with widths up to 250 mm with minimum inverted slope of 8  or higher. Under the same conditions, a bed composed of coarser particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 8 mm, only the upper 2. 5 cm of the 4 cm thick bed will erode. Under combined sewer conditions, 50 successive flushes will erode over a length of at least 20 m a 5 cm uniform bed layer composed of fine combined sewer sediment, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 08 mm, &# 961;s&# 8804; 1600 kg/m 3, in channels with widths up to 500 mm with inverted slope of 5  or higher. In channels of 100 m length or longer, and considering an inverted slope in the range 2  to 8 , 50 successive flushes seem to be deficient in scouring a 2. 5 cm thick sediment bed. In general terms it is discovered that Giehl flushing tanks are able to remove over a distance of 50 m the uniform sediment layers with depths below 4 cm in combined sewers with widths smaller than 250 mm. In a subsequent investigation, the InfoWorks CS software (Innovyze Co., UK) is utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the flushes from Giehl flushing tanks in increasing the required sediment scouring forces, particularly the bottom shear stresses, in sewer pipes. Initially, the effect of the flushes in long pipe-series is assessed so that an intuition concerning the propagation of the flushes through long distances together with the corresponding shear stress enhancements can be attained. After that, the increase in bottom shear stresses by the flushes along 20, 50, and 100 -m channels is inspected. It is detected that in combined/stormwater sewers with diameters of 250 to 500 mm and inverted slopes smaller than 8 , and considering a sediment-cleansing threshold of 3. 385 N/m 2, the effective flushing lengths are limited to 20 to 42 m (respectively in wider and narrower channels). In sanitary networks (considering a self-cleansing threshold of 2 N/m 2), the sediment-cleansing efficiency is more discernible and given an inverted slope of maximum 8  the flushing length varies between 100 m in narrow channels down to 54 m in wider channels. In brief, Giehl flushing tanks are believed to be suitable devices for generating self-cleansing hydraulic forces up to a distance of 50 m in narrow (i. e. width up to 250 mm) combined/stormwater sewers, even exceeding 100 m in narrow sanitary sewers with moderate inverted slopes of maximum 8 . Subsequently, through a novel attempt the most appropriate position of this flushing device in sewer networks for optimum efficiency in terms of self-cleansing maintenance is investigated with the application to a case study, i. e. sewer network of Erpe-Mere in Flanders, Belgium. In the latter attempt, the sediment deposition and erosion is modelled using InfoWorks CS with the double aim to investigate the effect of the flushes on the scour of deposited sediment beds and to discover the lengths along which a specific self-cleansing criterion can be maintained by the discharged flushes. The possible negative impacts in terms of sewer surcharging or manhole flooding is also inspected. The self-cleansing shear stresses were achieved in 61 sewers or in 69. 3 % of the pipes suitable for the installation of a flushing tank, covering a total cleansing length of 5788 m, representing 74. 4 % of total length of the pipes apt to the implementation of flushing tanks. It is deduced that flushing tanks cannot always guarantee self-cleansing prevalence in all parts of a sewer network, even after increasing the number of flushing tanks particularly in locations prone to sedimentation. Moreover, Giehl flushing tanks do not guarantee the removal of sediments from places susceptible for sedimentation. For these locations in order to prevent the accumulation of sediments and once deposited for theirerosion the effectiveness of a Giehl flushing tank has to be assessed separately, using an appropriate sediment transport modelling tool. In this accordance, it is agreed that InfoWorks CS is incapable of properly simulating the sediment bed development (deposition phase) and the change in sediment heights during flushing operations in sewer channels. In the end, through an unexampled attempt the two numerical models, i. e. InfoWorks CS being a commercial software and the Catania model as a specialized research-based numerical model, developed for different type of objectives and circumstances, are compared for identical channels with respect to the simulated hydraulic components and sediment deposition patters. Accordingly, the application of the Giehl flushing <b>tank</b> in this <b>sewer</b> network is evaluated with reference to the sediment deposition results achieved earlier by the Catania numerical model, so that by learning the potential spots with the highest sediment deposition likelihood the implementation of these flushing tanks can be optimized. This would require sediment transport and hydraulic modelling schemes to be integrated. status: publishe...|$|R
