On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne but <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass.

25|$|Commercially grown {{orange trees}} are {{propagated}} asexually by grafting a mature cultivar onto a suitable seedling rootstock {{to ensure the}} same yield, identical fruit characteristics, and resistance to diseases throughout the years. Propagation involves two stages: first, a rootstock is grown from seed. <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is approximately one year old, the leafy top is cut off and a bud taken from a specific scion variety, is grafted into its bark. The scion is what determines the variety of orange, while the rootstock makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific soil and climatic conditions. Thus, rootstocks influence {{the rate of growth}} and have an effect on fruit yield and quality.|$|E

Cost per athlete was USD 1.4 million. This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often cost {{as much or more}} than the sports-related costs. In 2005 London secured the bid for the 2012 Summer Games with a cost estimate that two years later proved inadequate and was revised upwards with around 100 percent. <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> turned out that the final outturn costs were slightly below the revised budget, the organizers falsely, but very publicly, claimed that the London Games had come in under budget.

Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some of the songs in 1963, but not all. Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album Introducing...

500|$|The short parodies Superman, with John Williams' {{theme from}} the 1978 film playing as Wilson {{changes in the}} booth. It was noted that Leitch's [...] "icy blue" [...] {{cinematography}} differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first Deadpool, on which Wernick said [...] "every director brings their take to the material" [...] and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted {{the opening of the}} short to feel like the opening of Logan, [...] "so {{if you were going to}} see Logan and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [...] in the hoodie, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> turns out to be Deadpool you realize what's going on." [...] They described the short as an absurd one-off [...] "that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if we feel like it's funny. That was our goal there." [...] The short makes several references to Logan: it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to Logan and that film's focus on older characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this I knew I wanted to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted.

2500|$|In effect, the British and French had, {{through the}} Munich negotiations, {{pressured}} their ally Czechoslovakia to cede {{part of its}} territory to a hostile neighbor {{in order to preserve}} peace.

[...] When Chamberlain received the news, he dismissed it out of hand. In September, the British received assurance that the General Staff's offer to launch the coup still stood, with key private sector, police and army support, even though Beck had resigned his post.

In October 2014, when evidence tampering charges were dropped against Dylan Adams just days after he was charged with rape, Herbison said: [...] "If those reports are correct, it means that they're just playing games", Herbison said.
