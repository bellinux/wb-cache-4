5|$|As most {{explicitly}} {{noted by}} the first quatrain, the poem was originally intended to be sung. Indeed, as noted by Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply melody and verse.

5|$|Innis {{argued that}} {{a balance between the}} spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of Plato.

5|$|Western civilization {{could only}} be saved, Innis argued, by {{recovering}} the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> within universities while freeing {{institutions of higher learning}} from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>tradition.</b> In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E

5|$|Oral history {{provides}} {{two different}} accounts of Andrianjaka's succession {{to the throne}} of the Kingdom of Imerina. According to popular legend, Ralambo devised a test to determine which of his two sons was most fit to rule: he would summon them both to join him at his capital in Ambohidrabiby, and whichever of his two sons reached him soonest would inherit his kingdom. In one account of this legend, Andrianjaka was reportedly engrossed in strategizing a win in a difficult game of fanorona and so refused to admit audience to the royal messenger until after the game was over. During this delay, his older brother Andriantompokoindrindra received his father's message and rushed home; he was thus awarded Ralambo's title and kingdom. However, this tale continues, Andriantompokoindrindra's claim to power {{was rejected by the}} public, and he was soon forced to cede the throne to Andrianjaka. In an alternate account of the succession tale, it is Andriantompokoindrindra (not Andrianjaka) who was said to be preoccupied with the fanorona game—a version in keeping with <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> that credits him with the game's invention and popularization at court—and his refusal to return to his father until after the game had finished led Ralambo to choose Andrianjaka as his successor. One source states that the summons was not a test, but rather occurred during the aforementioned incident when Ralambo was besieged in his capital by the Antsihanaka warriors and was genuinely in need of his sons' assistance.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Every African society {{south of}} the Sahara {{has a long history}} of {{transmitting}} knowledge and human experience through <b>the</b> medium of <b>oral</b> <b>tradition.</b> This paper is on <b>the</b> function of <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> among <b>the</b> Arsi-Oromo of Ethiopia. Before the coming of Islam and Christianity, the Arsi were followers of Waaqeffannaa (belief in Sky God), the Oromo version of the African traditional religion. In the Arsiland, the Oromo traditional religion existed side by side with Islam, as the latter was mostly tolerant in the past. The indigenous Oromo religious traditions offered Islam an African feature. The cult of Sheikh Hussein of Bale is one quasi-Islamic tradition that has survived. <b>The</b> Arsi <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> are good sources about the nature of Waaqeffannaa and the cult of Sheikh Hussein. Based on <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> of <b>the</b> Arsi and other African societies, the writer concluded that in Africa <b>the</b> function of <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> is in constant fl ux. In addition to replicating the past experiences of <b>the</b> society, African <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> serve also as mediums to provide self-conscious commentary on the patterns of life in their societies. Another conclusion is that the homology or dialectical unity between oral art and its social function is contextually determined.
