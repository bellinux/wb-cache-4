5|$|After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, State Street (anchored by Marshall Field's) in the {{downtown}} Loop, especially the Loop Retail Historic District, was the city's retailing center.

5|$|Between 1904 and 1908, one of {{the main}} service {{patterns}} was the West Side Branch, running from Lower Manhattan <b>to</b> <b>Van</b> Cortlandt Park via what is now the Lexington Avenue, 42nd Street, and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines. There were both local and express services with express trains south of 96th Street. Some express trains ran to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn via the Joralemon Street Tunnel during rush hours while all other trains turned around at City Hall or South Ferry.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted <b>to</b> <b>van</b> Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E

5|$|M-59 was {{converted}} into a freeway starting in 1966 with the first segment between Pontiac and Rochester. A second segment opened in 1972 east to Utica. Segments were converted to divided highway in Oakland County in 1984 through 1986. The east end was reconstructed in 1995–97 and converted to a six- to eight-lane divided highway. The freeway was extended east in 1998 <b>to</b> <b>Van</b> Dyke Avenue in Utica.|$|E
5|$|The Gators later {{drove to}} the 4-yard line before they were held on downs. After Dodd's punt to midfield, the Gators' {{engineered}} their final scoring drive. A 27-yard pass from Brumbaugh <b>to</b> <b>Van</b> Sickel got the Gators out of bounds at the 1-yard line. Crabtree ran it in for the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point was wide and short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, claim it was blocked.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>van</b> der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E

5|$|After several {{exhausting}} {{tours of}} Italy, the band split in 1972. They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change {{and a slight}} rename <b>to</b> <b>Van</b> der Graaf. The band split in 1978. After many years apart, the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.|$|E
5|$|Although the tree-ring {{analysis}} of the Philadelphia painting firmly places it in van Eyck's workshop, the technical evidence fails to prove indisputably whether van Eyck or a workshop member painted it. Until the early 1980s {{it was thought that}} the Philadelphia panel was the original and the Turin panel a copy, but x-ray analysis revealed a highly developed and sophisticated design underneath the paint that is accepted as by Jan van Eyck's hand. Infrared reflectography further disclosed extensive underdrawings beneath the original paint; the artist even made alterations to the composition after laying down the underdrawings and completing the painting. The underdrawings are typical of van Eyck's work and similar to those found in the Ghent Altarpiece, thereby, according to Luber, tying the Turin version <b>to</b> <b>van</b> Eyck.|$|E
50|$|Until 2017, {{there were}} five Sprinter trains per hour from Rotterdam Centraal station to Maassluis West and half-hourly {{services}} <b>to</b> Hoek <b>van</b> Holland Haven.

5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Van Nistelrooy was {{immediately}} confronted by Arsenal players Martin Keown, Lauren, Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole and Kolo Touré. Keown jumped up next <b>to</b> <b>Van</b> Nistelrooy and brought his arms {{down hard on}} the Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy in the back and Parlour and Cole offered verbal abuse. Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E
5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed <b>to</b> <b>van</b> Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today {{the consensus is that}} both were painted by the same hand.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen years later, {{after his}} wife dies, van Kempen and Ervine return to the Indies. He has been hired as a {{supervisor}} at another plantation, not far from his old place of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but none of his old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>van</b> Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays {{at home with their}} mother.|$|E

50|$|The Busette {{proved to}} be a very popular Wayne product. School bus {{versions}} were widely accepted by Head Start and special education programs. In comparison <b>to</b> <b>vans</b> and other small buses, the Busette's dual rear-wheel design was favorable to single rear wheels due to its greater stability. The Busette's low overall height made it seem smaller to drivers transitioning from passenger <b>vans</b> <b>to</b> larger buses.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost <b>to</b> <b>Van</b> Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for {{the only time in}} American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|HMCS Integrity was a cutter {{built by}} the Colonial Government of New South Wales in 1804.

5|$|Harrison {{was born}} into wealth in 1773. He started a {{military}} career before using his father's connections to gain office on the frontier. After a decade as governor of Indiana Territory, Harrison made his reputation fighting the Native Americans, notably at the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe and, once the War of 1812 began, the British. He was triumphant over both at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. After the war, {{he was elected to}} Congress from Ohio and served in a variety of federal offices over the next two decades. A regional Whig candidate for the White House in 1836, he finished second <b>to</b> <b>Van</b> Buren and did not stop running for president until he won the office four years later.|$|E
