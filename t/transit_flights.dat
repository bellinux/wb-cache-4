2500|$|In 1960, I. S. O. Playfair, the British {{official}} historian {{wrote that}} {{the relationship of the}} [...] "battle for supplies" [...] with the land war reached a climax {{in the second half of}} 1942. Far from the Eighth Army capturing airfields to the west in the Cyrenaican bulge, it had been defeated at Gazala while Operation Julius was on and lost the landing grounds to the east. The disaster at Gazala had led to the military forces on Malta trying to save Egypt rather than vice-versa. MW11 had been a [...] "disappointing operation" [...] and turned back because the British and US air attacks on the Italian battlefleet had failed to inflict the damage hoped. Force A could not hope to defeat it in a surface action, a view echoed by Greene and Massignani in 2003. By the time that the Italian battleships had been ordered back, the convoy and escorts lacked the ammunition to continue and seven long-range Beaufighters had been lost, depriving Vigorous of air cover while beyond the reach of short-range fighters. Communications had been inadequate, with some signals taking too long to arrive but Playfair wrote that without airfields in the west of Cyrenaica, even quick and accurate reports would not have compensated. Six freighters in Vigorous and Harpoon had been sunk and nine forced to return to port. Two ships of Operation Harpoon reached Malta and delivered [...] of supplies, which with a decent harvest might keep the population of Malta fed until September but the depletion of aviation fuel led to fighters being give priority over the offensive force. <b>Transit</b> <b>flights</b> through Malta except for Beauforts was suspended, only close range air attacks on easy targets were to be permitted and fuel for the fighters was to be carried to Malta by submarine.|$|E

50|$|Constance Ruth Leathart (7 December 1903 - 4 November 1993) was a British female {{pilot who}} flew Royal Air Force {{aircraft}} on <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> in World War Two as an Air Transport Auxiliary.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, {{the first}} {{terminal}} stopped working, {{due to the}} opening of the new one and from September until October, the airport was accepting the <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> from and to Chita, due to its closing, because of the runway re-construction. In 1988 and 1989, the airport started to serve a number of <b>transit</b> <b>flights,</b> including the international (Moscow - Pyongyang, including Air Koryo; Moscow - Ulan-Bator), shifted from Irkutsk, due to runway re-construction. That situation led to a huge optimization of the airport, where every day the airport accepted 70 flights, which 30 of them were served by Tupolev Tu-154. In 1990, the airport transferred 800 thousand passengers in a year.|$|E
50|$|Early in the 2000s, Boryspil {{became a}} hub airport serving destined and <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> of foreign airlines. Its {{development}} strategy stresses the hub role since domestic passenger demand is growing insufficiently {{compared to the}} possible transit traffic.|$|E
500|$|On 5 October 1944, Lent flew a Junkers Ju88 on {{a routine}} <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> from Stade to Nordborchen, [...] south of Paderborn.

50|$|The airline was {{investing}} into {{building a}} new modern passenger terminal in Khrabrovo airport {{which would be the}} main transit hub in a hub-and-spoke system of routes, which the airline was planning to introduce on 15 June 2007. In the first stage, up to 13 cities of the Russian Federation would be connected with 13-15 cities of Europe by <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> via Kaliningrad.|$|E
50|$|On {{a transit}} flight (getting {{to or from}} a display location) the team may fly at the {{relatively}} low altitude of 1000 ft. This avoids the complication of moving though the cloud base in formation, and also avoids much controlled air space. Jets are more efficient at higher altitude, so longer flights are made at 35000 to 42000 ft. On <b>transit</b> <b>flights,</b> the formation can include spare planes. Sometimes a C-130 Hercules accompanies them, carrying spare parts.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} that a Su-9 {{was involved in the}} interception of Francis Gary Powers' U-2 on Soviet territory on 1 May 1960. A newly manufactured Su-9 which was in <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> happened to be near Powers' U-2. The Su-9 was unarmed and was directed to ram the U-2. One ramming attempt was made and the Su-9 missed the U-2, primarily due to large difference in the speed of the two planes. No further ramming attempt was made due to Su-9's lack of fuel.|$|R
50|$|Air BC was {{established}} in 1980 after the merger (by the Jim Pattison Group) {{of a number of}} west coast domestic airlines: Canadian Air <b>Transit,</b> <b>Flight</b> Operation, Gulf Air Aviation, Haida Airlines, Island Airlines, Ominecca Air, Pacific Coast Air Services and West Coast Air Services. A combined fleet emerged, including STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters with some Twin Otters being operated as float planes. In 1983, STOL capable DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop aircraft were delivered and then in 1986 DHC-8 Dash 8-100 turboprops were acquired.|$|R
50|$|By June 1917 the {{cumbersome}} {{tail unit}} {{had been replaced}} by a cleaner design with a single tailplane and finely formed fins and rudders mounted {{at the end of each}} boom. The new boom structure was much stronger and of simpler design. Evaluation by the SVK (Seeflugzeugs-Versuchs-Kommando - Seaplane Testing Command), was carried out from 23 to 26 June 1917 testing various engine off configurations and water-borne handling. Given a qualified clean bill of health, the Rs.II was prepared for a <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> to Norderney on the North Sea coast to carry out seaworthiness trials.|$|R

50|$|A new {{international}} terminal funded by Japanese {{official development assistance}} and constructed by a consortium of four Japanese contractors (KTOM, abbreviation of four contractors' names: Kajima - Taisei - Obayashi - Maeda), opened in September 2007 with a capacity for 12 million passengers a year. The new terminal gives the airport a total annual capacity of 20 million passengers. The old terminal is now used for domestic flights. After 2025, when Long Thanh International Airport is completed, Tan Son Nhat will remain operational; however, it will mostly serve for domestic flights, a few international flights and no longer serve <b>transit</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{airlines}} {{agreed to}} attempt as many point-to-point <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> as possible, although {{they would still}} have to operate some flights via a hub-and-spoke network. Specifically, SAS would degrade Stockholm-Arlanda Airport and Oslo Airport, Fornebu from hub, and instead focus its traffic in Copenhagen, which would become the main hub for flights to China and Japan. Swissair's hub at Zürich Airport would become the main hub for flights to Africa and South-East Asia, KLM's hub at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport would become the main hub for flights to South America, while Austrian's hub at Vienna International Airport would become the main hub for flights to Eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Powers {{was shot}} down by an S-75 Dvina (SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile over Sverdlovsk. A total of {{fourteen}} were launched, one of which hit a MiG-19 jet fighter which was sent to intercept the U-2 but could not reach a high enough altitude. Its pilot, Sergei Safronov, ejected but died of his injuries. Another Soviet aircraft, a newly manufactured Su-9 in <b>transit</b> <b>flight,</b> also attempted to intercept Powers' U-2. The unarmed Su-9 was directed to ram the U-2 but missed {{because of the large}} differences in speed (the Su-9 flew above Mach 1.1, while the U-2 flew at approximately Mach 0.6).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a finite}} set of targets, with each target {{assigned}} a relative deadline, and {{each pair of}} targets assigned a fixed <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> time. Given a flock of identical UAVs, can one ensure that every target is repeatedly visited by some UAV at intervals of duration at most the target's relative deadline? The uav Problem {{is the question of}} whether this task has a solution. This problem can straightforwardly be solved in PSPACE by modelling it as a network of timed automata. The special case of there being a single UAV is claimed to be NP-complete in the literature. In this paper, we show that the uav Problem is in fact PSPACE-complete even in the single-UAV case. ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins and}} ends in an airport during a father and son’s <b>transit</b> <b>ﬂight</b> from Tel Aviv to Manila. It {{tells the story of}} Moises (Ping Medina), a Filipino single-dad working as a {{caregiver}} in Herzliya, Israel, who comes home to his apartment in Tel Aviv to celebrate his son Joshua (Marc Justine Alvarez)’s 4th birthday. It was on that day that Moises, together with their Filipino neighbors Janet (Irma Adlawan), and her daughter Yael (Jasmine Curtis), ﬁnd out that the Israeli government is going to deport children of foreign workers. Afraid of the new law, Moises and Janet decide to hide their children from the immigration police by making them stay inside the house.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 GWR rules {{changed and}} the old record of 106 days 10 hours 33 minutes (22,997km/14,206 miles) set by Jay Aldous and Matt DeWall in 1984 will now stand in GWR archives. The new rules now state that the journey should be {{continuous}} and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be 18,000 miles (29,000 km), and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length.

50|$|During the {{immediate}} postwar years, Research and Development Command used the airfield for various R&D projects, including {{testing of the}} Convair XB-46 experimental jet bomber. It was also used by the Eastern Defense Command as a storage facility for excess Demolition and General purpose Bombs. The Air Force also used the airport for <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> in conjunction with its activities with its Representative Office, Detachment 4, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Group. This arrangement continues to this day. In addition, the Air Force Reserve's 435th Troop Carrier Group operated C-119 Flying Boxcars from the field until June 1949, when it relocated to a military cantonment area at Miami Airport.|$|E
50|$|The first Bonaire-Miami flight {{took place}} on April 19, 1980, {{possible}} since the runway extension of that year. The current runway of 2880m is long enough for flights to Europe with a maximum take-off weight. KLM began with flights to Peru and later to Ecuador with a fuelstop on Bonaire in 2002. In recent years, the facilities at the airport have been modernized and expanded. There is a new departure hall, a new platform for wide body aircraft and a fuel farm was also added. As of 2009, Flamingo Airport is a full service stop for <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> and the destination for many tourist flights, with air-conditioned offices, restaurant, departure hall and stores.|$|E

50|$|Since 3 July 2010, a walkway opened between Terminals D, E, F, and the Aeroexpress railway {{terminal}} on {{the public}} access side. Since 2 November 2010, a walkway opened between Terminals D, E, and F on the security side. Both of these simplify transfer between <b>transit</b> <b>flights.</b> After the reconstruction, the southern complex of the airport (terminals D, E and F) {{will be able to}} receive up to 25 million passengers annually. Ultimately, after {{the northern part of the}} airport is reconstructed, the airport will have the capacity to receive 40 million passengers annually. Since December 25, 2009, all terminals have been identified by letters (Latin characters) as opposed to numbers. In December 2011, a new Area control center (ACC) was opened. It consolidates the gathering, monitoring, and control of the airport's different control centres across all of the organizations that affect its efficient operation. The Situational Center also forms part of the airport control center. SC is intended for joint work of top-managers, heads of state bodies, and partners of Sheremetyevo.

50|$|Due to {{strained}} {{relations between}} the USSR and US during the 1980s, in 1984 Aeroflot coordinated with Irish carrier Aer Lingus to use Shannon airport as a hub for connecting flights from Moscow and Leningrad to link with the Irish carrier's New York routes. Aeroflot was also granted rights to use Shannon for flights to Cuba and South America (Peru). From 1992 Irish tour operators contracted Aeroflot to carry tourists to the eastern US (Miami) and later to the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico, using Il-62Ms. On any given day, Shannon hosted up to eight Il-62s and Il-86s (in addition to Tu-154s and Tu-134s). By 1995/1996, Shannon was handling 2,400 Aeroflot <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> carrying 250,000 passengers per annum (including government-registered Il-62Ms) with Aeroflot crews being housed near Shannon airport. By 1995, direct flights between Moscow and the US became possible {{and the use of}} Shannon as a hub declined. For its US west-coast air links (which began in 1991) Aeroflot Il-62s flew east to Anchorage from Moscow and several cities in the Russian Far East (Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Magadan, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk), often continuing on to San Francisco. Trans-Pacific Il-62 flights between the Russian Far East and Anchorage continued until 2000.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of gaseous atmospheric hydrocarbon compounds, halocarbons, and nitrous oxide were studied. Whole air {{samples were collected}} aboard the NCAR Electra aircraft platform during the Monsoon Experiment (MONEX) flights in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and on ferry flights {{to and from the}} United States. Foliage emission rates were also measured on some tropical plants. The average free tropospheric TNMHC (total non-methane hydrocarbon) levels from both the <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> and mission flights were low (2. 5 pg/m 3). TNMHC just above the forest canopy over Borneo but within the mixing layer was higher and the concentrations over land were higher than those obtained over the ocean. The fluorocarbons showed a small latitude gradient or a difference between continental and oceanic air masses or (possibily) both. Methyl chloroform also showed a significant latitude profile. Nitrous oxide was uniformly distributed in the atmosphere. The C, hydrocarbons, ethane and acetylene, also showed latitudinal gradients. The emission rates of foliage in the tropics were higher than those reported by other investigators for the mid-latitudes.
