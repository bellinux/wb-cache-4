Twenty-six stations offer bus transfer services and eighteen have free park-and-ride lots {{with a total of}} 7,379 available parking spaces. Works of public art included at several stations were developed as part of the RT Public Art Program, and represent an array of media including, mosaics, sculptures, metalwork and murals. Each was commissioned to incorporate an identity and sense of place unique <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> surrounding the station.|$|E

5|$|Tracing {{its history}} {{back to the}} 1870s, the Ghetto now {{includes}} more than 200 university-owned houses as well as landlord-owned houses, high-density housing and gathering spaces. With the inclusion of Holy Angels and The Darkside, two smaller neighborhoods the university owns property in, {{there are more than}} 400 houses currently used as student residential space. Because of the area's age, the university has been engaged in a program to renovate and update the Ghetto, and several additional changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> are expected in the coming years as part of the university's Master Plan.|$|E
5|$|Asch was shy when {{he moved}} to the United States and did not speak English fluently. He went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade. As a result of the {{language}} barrier, Asch had a very difficult time understanding in class. He learned English by reading Charles Dickens. Asch later attended Townsend Harris High School, a very selective high school attached to the City College of New York. After high school, he attended the City College of New York, majoring in both literature and science. He became interested in psychology towards the end of his undergraduate career after reading the work of William James and a few philosophers. In 1928, when he was 21 years old, he received his Bachelor of Science.|$|E
5|$|CenturyLink Field is {{bordered by}} the {{junction}} of Interstates 5 and 90 {{to the east and}} State Route 99 to its west. The State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over the train tracks that run along the east sides of CenturyLink and Safeco Fields. An overpass for S Royal Brougham Way, the road that borders the south edge of the CenturyLink Field complex, to improve access and safety was completed in May 2010. The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding lots to accommodate automobile traffic. Beginning in December 2011, construction of the Stadium Place mixed-use development project replaced much of the north lot. The developer must replace the 500 lost parking spots and turn over parking revenue to the Public Stadium Authority per an agreement with King County.|$|E

5|$|Lester Burnham is {{a middle-aged}} {{advertising}} executive and magazine writer who despises his job. He is unhappily married to Carolyn, a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious {{real estate broker}} who grows red roses in their yard; their teenage daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are the Fitts family, consisting of a homophobic retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife, Barbara, and their teenage son, Ricky, who constantly films his surroundings with a camcorder, collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom. His part-time job as a bar caterer and waiter serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealings. Frank is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live nearby, welcome the Fitts family <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> On the way to school, Frank reveals his homophobia while he angrily discusses the incident with Ricky.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui, brought even more mainstream success {{to the band}} through repeated airplay on MTV. The video debuted in September 1993. It was shot with low quality photographic equipment, which, like several other early Pumpkins videos, was an intentional stylistic decision. Corgan said that {{the plot of the}} video was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck driver who, upon quitting his job, gave out his remaining stock of ice cream <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> children. This image was then melded with Sednaoui's own sensibilities inspired by the film Zabriskie Point. The video is available on The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991–2000) DVD, released in 2001.|$|E
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E

5|$|Sutner {{defines a}} {{directed}} graph (a type of de Bruijn graph) {{in which each}} vertex represents a pair of assignments of states for the cells in a contiguous sequence of cells. The length of this sequence is chosen to be one less than the neighborhood size of the automaton. An edge in Sutner's graph represents a pair of sequences of cells that overlap {{in all but one}} cell, so that the union of the sequences is a full neighborhood in the cellular automaton. Each such edge is directed from the overlapping subsequence on the left to the subsequence on the right. Edges are only included in the graph when they represent compatible state assignments on the overlapping parts of their cell sequences, and when the automaton rule (applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> determined by the potential edge) would give the same results for both assignments of states. By performing a linear-time strong connectivity analysis of this graph, it is possible to determine which of its vertices belong to cycles. The transition rule is non-injective if and only if this graph contains a directed cycle in which at least one vertex has two differing state assignments.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the city allowed {{a number of}} local artists to paint walls of the Good-Latimer Expressway tunnel (a major entry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood).</b> The wide variety of images, largely in a 'graffiti' style, had long been a popular display, leading many to {{conclude}} (incorrectly) that the city allowed graffiti in parts of Deep Ellum. The tunnel was demolished in spring 2007 {{to make way for}} the DART Green Line train.|$|E
