5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the <b>target</b> <b>site</b> and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E

In order to carry out modification, each snoRNA associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP).

The snoRNA molecule contains an antisense element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides), which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule.

Although {{it is well}} known that multiple miRNAs may work as miRNA modules to synergistically regulate common target mRNAs, the understanding of miRNA modules is still in its infancy. Results: We employed the recently generated high throughput experimental data to study miRNA modules. We predicted 181 miRNA modules and 306 potential miRNA modules. We observed that the <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> of these predicted modules were in general weaker compared with those not bound by miRNA modules.

25|$|MiR-1 has {{key roles}} in the {{development}} and differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles. For example, in the lineage-specific differention of smooth muscle cells from embroyonic stem cell derived cultures, MiR-1 is required; as its loss of function resulted in a reduction in smooth muscle cell biomarkers and a reduction in the derived smooth muscle cell population. There is evidence that the control of smooth muscle cell differentiation by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 recognition site is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed down-regulation of KLF4 and an inhibition of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

En route, he spotted a Rufe flying low on the water. Kepford pounced on the vulnerable float plane and easily shot it down. Immediately after, a mass of 20 or so enemy fighters spotted Kepford flying alone beneath them and dove on the vulnerable pilot. He was quickly penned in by four enemy aircraft and forced to head north, away from his base. He used his plane's water injection—a new feature installed on a small number of Corsairs—to help him pull as far ahead of the enemies as possible, but the device worked fitfully. He tried to lose them flying low over land, without success. Deciding he was moving too far afield to return to base on remaining fuel reserves, Kepford quickly cut to the left and reversed direction south over the water. The plane following Kepford on the left side attempted to turn inside to shoot him down, but the pilot misjudged his altitude and struck his wing into the water below, crashing. Those on the right side lost too much ground when Kepford reversed, so they gave up the chase.|$|E

Recent findings indicate that SNPs could create, destroy, or modify the efficiency of miRNA binding to the 3 'UTR of a gene, resulting in gene dysregulation. With the rapidly growing number of published disease-associated SNPs (dSNPs), there is a strong need for resources specifically recording dSNPs on the 3 'UTRs and their nucleotide distance from miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites.</b> We present here miRdSNP, a database incorporating three important areas of dSNPs, miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites,</b> and diseases. Description miRdSNP provides a unique database of dSNPs on the 3 'UTRs of human genes manually curated from PubMed. The current release includes 786 dSNP-disease associations for 630 unique dSNPs and 204 disease types. miRdSNP annotates genes with experimentally confirmed targeting by miRNAs and indexes miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> predicted by TargetScan and PicTar as well as potential miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> newly generated by dSNPs. A robust web interface and search tools are provided for studying the proximity of miRNA binding sites to dSNPs in relation to human diseases. Searches can be dynamically filtered by gene name, miRBase ID, target prediction algorithm, disease, and any nucleotide distance between dSNPs and miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites.</b> Results can be viewed at the sequence level showing the annotated locations for miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> and dSNPs on the entire 3 'UTR sequences.

40|$|BACKGROUND: microRNAs are {{generally}} understood to regulate gene expression through binding to target sequences within 3 '-UTRs of mRNAs.

A database of potential microRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> in promoters would stimulate {{research in this field}} leading to more understanding of complex microRNA regulatory mechanism. METHODOLOGY: We developed a database hosting predicted microRNA <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> located within human promoter sequences and their associated genomic features, called microPIR (microRNA-Promoter Interaction Resource). microRNA seed sequences were used to identify perfect complementary matching sequences in the human promoters and the potential <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> were predicted using the RNAhybrid program. > 15 million <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> were identified which are located within 5000 bp upstream of all human genes, on both sense and antisense strands. The experimentally confirmed argonaute (AGO) binding sites and EST expression data including the sequence conservation across vertebrate species of each predicted target are presented for researchers to appraise the quality of predicted <b>target</b> <b>sites.</b> The microPIR database integrates various annotated genomic sequence databases, e. g. repetitive elements, transcription factor binding sites, CpG islands, and SNPs, offering users the facility to extensively explore relationships among <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> and other genomic features. Furthermore, functional information of target genes including gene ontologies, KEGG pathways, and OMIM associations are provided. The built-in genome browser of microPIR provides a comprehensive view of multidimensional genomic data. Finally, microPIR incorporates a PCR primer design module to facilitate experimental validation.

40|$|Although general anesthetics {{are often}} {{said to be}} nonspecific agents, {{it is likely that}} they act at a much more {{restricted}} set of <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> than commonly believed. The traditional view has been that the primary targets are lipid portions of nerve membranes, but recent evidence shows that the effects on lipid bilayers of clinically relevant levels of anesthetics are very small. Effects on most proteins are also small, but there are notable examples of proteins that are extremely sensitive to anesthetics and mimic the pharmacological profile of anesthetic <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> in animals. Such <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> are amphiphilic in nature, having both hydrophobic and polar components. The polar components appear to behave as good hydrogenbond acceptors but poor hydrogen-bond donors. Although the targets can accept molecules {{with a wide variety of}} shapes and chemical groupings, they are unaffected by molecules exceeding a certain size. Overall, the data can be explained by supposing that the primary <b>target</b> <b>sites</b> underlying general anesthesia are amphiphilic pockets of circumscribed dimensions on particularly sensitive proteins in the central nervous system...|$|R
