5|$|On the city's website, Winnipeg, Canada {{is listed}} as a sister city since 1973, but <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> not listed as sister cities in the organization's 2014 {{membership}} directory.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> {{churches in}} Zalma.

5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences {{of the two}} species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E

5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black dogfish in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same species. A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are,</b> in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E
5|$|After {{being held}} {{eighteen}} months without trial, Amir is released {{and returned to}} Batavia. He is unable to find Tati, leaving him to wander the streets. Omi spots him, and again she asks him to play with her troupe. Amir agrees, and soon newspapers are filled with advertisements touting his name. Spotting one, Tati and Abdul Sidik go to a performance, only to learn that Amir {{was the victim of}} a car accident. At the hospital, where Amir is being treated by Pardi, Tati learns the truth behind Amir's absence. On his deathbed, Amir asks Pardi to take care of Tati; <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> later married.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E
50|$|Miscibility of <b>two</b> {{materials}} <b>is</b> often determined optically. When <b>the</b> <b>two</b> miscible liquids <b>are</b> combined, {{the resulting}} liquid is clear. If the mixture <b>is</b> cloudy <b>the</b> <b>two</b> materials <b>are</b> immiscible. Care {{must be taken}} with this determination. If the indices of refraction of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> materials <b>are</b> similar, an immiscible mixture may be clear and give an incorrect determination that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> liquids <b>are</b> miscible.|$|R
50|$|From 1928 until 1946 <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> united {{into one}} commune, officially named Gressoney, which from 1939 onward was Italianized as Gressonei. After WWII, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> former communes <b>were</b> reconstituted.|$|R

5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus {{he is unable to}} persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E
5|$|Although Squidward, {{annoyed with}} SpongeBob's fear at the story, manages to {{convince}} him that he made the whole story up, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> soon alarmed by strange occurrences that parallel the omens that signify the arrival of the Hash-Slinging Slasher later that night when the restaurant is empty. Although convinced at first that these occurrences are coincidence, Squidward grows more nervous as the occurrences continue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E

50|$|The yellow rosella, which lives {{along the}} Murray River {{and several of}} its tributaries, was {{reclassified}} (1968) as a subspecies, P. elegans flaveolus, of the crimson as <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> found to interbreed where their ranges overlap. The main difference between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> crimson areas replaced with light yellow and the tail more greenish.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> {{built on}} the same game engine, Oracle of Ages {{concentrates}} on puzzles, while Oracle of Seasons focuses on action. Each is a complete game capable of interacting with the other, via passwords or a Game Link Cable.|$|E
5|$|Armando Galarraga and Jim Joyce, {{along with}} Daniel Paisner, {{released}} {{a book titled}} Nobody's Perfect, chronicling their experiences {{during and after the}} game. In June 2011, one year after the near-perfect game, Major League Baseball put a rule into effect that Joyce cannot umpire any games in which Galarraga's team plays. Due to the book release, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> now business partners, and this relationship could affect Joyce's impartiality while umpiring Galarraga's team. It is similar to the policy that prevented umpire Jim Wolf from being the plate umpire in games that his younger brother Randy pitched in.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is {{with their}} nearest major neighbours, Tottenham Hotspur; matches between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> {{referred}} to as North London derbies. Other rivalries within London include those with Chelsea, Fulham and West Ham United. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title– {{so much so that}} a 2003 online poll by the Football Fans Census listed Manchester United as Arsenal's biggest rivals, followed by Tottenham and Chelsea. A 2008 poll listed the Tottenham rivalry as more important.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> {{otherwise}} unattested {{outside of}} Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions {{have been made}} that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a type of female deity).|$|E
5|$|At a hotel, Borat, {{just out}} of the bath, sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the Baywatch booklet. An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real motive for {{traveling}} to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones, which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed convention ballroom. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> finally separated by security guards.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} court White {{continues}} to advocate for the acknowledgment of mental health {{as one of the}} most important social issues, globally. White has also claimed progressive and pragmatic political views. White frequently challenges the fundamentals of capitalism and corporate culture and how <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> a major roadblock to achieving a better social equity and quality. White claims a business style of social entrepreneurship. A concept that is becoming very popular amongst millennial entrepreneurs.|$|E
