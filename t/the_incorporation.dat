40|$|Land {{retention}} {{to advance}} matters {{of importance to}} the tribe is the focus for this research. In particular, this thesis will investigate the effectiveness of Maori land incorporations as mechanisms to achieve tribal development aspirations. In order {{to answer this question}} the history of the lands in the Morikaunui and Atihau-Whanganui Maori Incorporations are used as case studies. Primarily, the reflection of tribal imperatives as the goal for land retention and utilisation is examined in two stages. The first stage investigates the pioneering years of the 20 th century during the time that the lands were held under the paternalistic control of the Aotea Maori Land Board (AMLB). The second stage analyses the ability of <b>the</b> <b>Incorporations</b> to reflect tribal imperatives since their establishment. During the first stage it will be demonstrated that the primary focus for Whanganui tribal groups was the protection of their estate. The use of legislative measures to achieve this succeeded to some extent but removed the ability of the Whanganui tribe to exercise any control over the management and administration of leasehold land and the Morikau Farm. Campaigns to return the lands to their management were successful upon the establishment of <b>the</b> Morikaunui <b>Incorporation</b> in 1955 and <b>the</b> Atihau-Whanganui <b>Incorporation</b> in 1969. <b>The</b> second stage begins by highlighting how the resources of <b>the</b> Morikaunui <b>Incorporation</b> were utilised by the Whanganui leadership to contribute to tribal development initiatives and the protection of tribal land interests. It is proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Incorporations</b> were set-up to reflect the tribal conscience of Whanganui iwi, hapū and whānau groups by supporting tribal imperatives. Furthermore, arguments are introduced to demonstrate that in contemporary times this has been less evident in the practices of <b>the</b> <b>Incorporations.</b> In reality, commercial and individual goals have prevailed. While <b>the</b> Atihau-Whanganui <b>Incorporation</b> has inherited an expensive legacy of paying compensation upon the resumption of leasehold lands, the thesis contends that tribal imperatives should form the basis for the future direction of the Morikaunui and Atihau-Whanganui Incorporations...|$|R

Saavedra declared that <b>the</b> <b>incorporation</b> was not fully legal, but that he supported it for public convenience.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, the N 2 O plasma oxides in-situ {{grown on}} CF 4 plasma pretreated silicon {{substrate}} is proposed and demonstrated having excellent characteristics. Those are precise thickness control, low temperature fabrication, low leakage current, and high reliability. Those good features {{will enhance the}} scaling down ability of CMOS devices. The mechanisms that make the process success are also discussed in this paper. Those achievements are caused from <b>the</b> <b>incorporations</b> of nitrogen and fluorine. Owing to <b>the</b> <b>incorporations,</b> <b>the</b> leakage current and the reliability are largely improved. It could be addressed that the low temperature oxides grown by N 2 O plasma are very attractive for novel CMOS VLSI circuit manufacturing; especially for the oxides grown on the CF 4 plasma pre-treated substrates...|$|R
