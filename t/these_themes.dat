5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{growth and}} forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. <b>These</b> <b>themes</b> have led critics to view Tolkien's own {{experiences}} during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences.|$|E

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>themes</b> {{were later}} expounded upon in The Fundamentals, {{a series of}} essays financed by wealthy Presbyterians Milton and Lyman Stewart. While the authors were drawn from the wider evangelical community, a large {{proportion}} were Presbyterian, including Warfield, William Erdman, Charles Erdman, and Robert Elliott Speer.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began {{exploring}} theatrical concepts on the group's albums; <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 {{and continued}} through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted {{to a traditional}} rock format throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} themes and versions of Uno. <b>These</b> <b>theme</b> games may come with slightly different directions and special cards.|$|R

5|$|Carter was {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{an article}} written by Diana C. Mutz compares the {{politics}} of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant '1) the value of tolerance and respect for difference; 2) opposition to violence and punitiveness; and 3) the dangers of authoritarianism.' She suggests that <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> are also present {{in the presidential election}} and it may {{play a significant role in}} how Americans have responded to the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to exhibitions of the Four Freedoms by Rockwell, {{there have been}} tribute exhibitions of works by other artists depicting <b>these</b> <b>themes.</b> For example, in 2008 at the Wolfsonian museum at Florida International University, 60 artists exhibited 80 works that represented their takes on the Four Freedoms. Other artists, such as Thomas Kinkade, have found individual inspiration in Rockwell's patriotic works, resulting in their own works using different symbols to present similar themes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} to six spirit weeks held {{throughout}} the school year. During <b>these</b> <b>themed</b> weeks, the ASB puts on spirit games in the quad that involve students and teachers in ridiculous but entertaining games. Usually these games involve one student from each class.|$|R
40|$|Report on {{the rate}} of {{business}} owenership by {{women and men in}} the UK. Early studies concentrated on descriptive accounts of the characteristics and motivations of women in business and their experiences of business ownership, particularly at start-up. <b>These</b> two <b>themes</b> still dominate the literature. However, greater methodological sophistication has developed, as have a number of more specialist <b>themes.</b> <b>These</b> specialist <b>themes</b> include: gender differences regarding management of the business, particularly with regard to finance, business networks, and performance...|$|R
50|$|Freeing HK has 7 {{branches}}, 6 of them {{located in}} Hong Kong and 1 in Macau. All branches have different themes including adventure, technology, Hong Kong style, fantasy, riddle, dream and Macau style. <b>These</b> <b>themed</b> rooms {{are located in}} Causeway Bay, Kwun Tong, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Tsuen Wan, Yuen Long and Macau respectively.|$|R
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given <b>these</b> <b>themes,</b> the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|Manning explores <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> {{not only}} in her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E

5|$|Outside North America {{it opened}} {{reasonably}} well. In Australia {{it was the}} highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's earnings were the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people read <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> {{in the news media}} already, and there is a perception that Hollywood films are biased.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Wagner's {{writings}} on Jews, including Jewishness in Music, corresponded to some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century; however, despite his very public views on <b>these</b> <b>themes,</b> {{throughout his life}} Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters. There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas. The characters of Mime in the Ring, Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger, and Klingsor in Parsifal are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas. The topic of Wagner and the Jews is further complicated by allegations, {{which may have been}} credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, and then once the screen was at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of Zionism {{and the state of}} Israel, however, <b>these</b> <b>themes</b> were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the {{national}} and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.|$|E

50|$|An old mill {{is a type}} of {{amusement}} park ride with unaccompanied boats floated on guideways through dark tunnels. <b>These</b> <b>themed</b> dark rides originated in the late 19th century and are known by a variety of names, including tunnel of love and river cave. While generally considered a gentle ride, a variation that ends with a climatic splashdown, similar to the modern-day log flume, is known as a mill chute.|$|R
