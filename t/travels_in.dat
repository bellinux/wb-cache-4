5|$|Among the Selfe family {{papers in}} Mitchell Library {{there is a}} large {{collection}} of postcards featuring bridges from across the world. Some were sent to Selfe by friends and relatives from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Others, un-postmarked, were collected on his <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> 1884-85. These would have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge-building practices for Selfe's own designs.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E

5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> crude {{lead bullion}} (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi). World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage. Malliagh explained that Chinese Nü Yr is based {{a story about}} 'Xiāngjiāo', a gelatinous and amorphous worm who wears a witch hat and is voiced by heavily pitch-shifted and processed recordings {{of his father and}} little sister. Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground. Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed at which it <b>travels.</b> <b>In</b> a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated the fate of the worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E

5|$|Choe's diary {{accounts}} of his <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> China became widely {{printed in the}} 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also refer to his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed Chinese culture as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|M-106 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan in and {{near the city of}} Jackson. M-106 <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> a southwest-to-northeast direction from Jackson to Gregory at a junction with M-36 just a few miles northwest of Hell. The highway was first designated in 1928 running north out of downtown Jackson. It connected U.S. Highway12 (US12) to the state prison and Bunkerhill Road. A pair of changes in the early 1930s resulted in the extension eastward to Gregory. From the 1960s until {{the early years of the}} 21st century, a section of M-106 in downtown Jackson was routed along one-way streets.|$|E
5|$|Nicolas Giraud {{was born}} in Greece to French parents; the name by which he is most {{commonly}} known, Nicolo, was {{given to him by}} Byron. Giraud may have been the brother-in-law of Giovanni Battista Lusieri, a Roman painter and broker for Lord Elgin. Demetrius Zograffo, Byron's guide in Greece, informed Byron that the 60-year-old Lusieri was unmarried, and was courting two women, each of whom believed that Lusieri was to marry her. Lusieri certainly had a close relationship with Giraud, so {{it is possible that the}} two were related in another way, perhaps as father and son. Byron met Giraud in Athens in January 1809, and the two were companions until Byron resumed his <b>travels</b> <b>in</b> March.|$|E
