5000|$|The {{discovery}} of tocotrienols was first reported by Pennock and Whittle in 1964, describing {{the isolation of}} tocotrienols from rubber. [...] The biological significance of tocotrienols was clearly delineated in the early 1980s, when its ability to lower cholesterol was first reported by Qureshi and Elson in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. During the 1990s, the anti-cancer properties of tocopherols and tocotrienols began to be delineated. The current commercial sources of <b>tocotrienol</b> are rice and palm. Other natural <b>tocotrienol</b> sources include rice bran oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter, barley, and wheat germ. Tocotrienols are safe and human studies show no adverse effects with consumption of 240 mg/day for 48 months. <b>Tocotrienol</b> rich fractions from rice, palm, or annatto, used in nutritional supplements, functional foods, and anti-aging cosmetics, {{are available in the}} market at 20%, 35%, 50%, and 70% total vitamin E content. Molecular distillation occurs at lower temperatures and reduces the problem of thermal decomposition. High vacuum also eliminates oxidation that might occur in the presence of air. [...] Annatto <b>tocotrienol</b> has the highest <b>tocotrienol</b> concentration and is tocopherol-free.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that {{alpha-tocopherol}} interferes with <b>tocotrienol</b> benefits. [...] High levels of α-tocopherol increase cholesterol production.α-Tocopherol interference with <b>tocotrienol</b> absorption was described previously by Ikeda, who showed that α-tococopherol interfered with absorption of α-tocotrienol, but not γ-tocotrienol. Finally, α-tocopherol was shown to interfere with tocotrienols by increasing catabolism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tocotrienols</b> {{are members}} of the vitamin E family: four <b>tocotrienols</b> (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) similar in {{structure}} to the four tocopherols, with the critical difference is that tocopherols have saturated side chains whereas <b>tocotrienols</b> have unsaturated isoprenoid side chains with three double bonds. Preliminary clinical trials on dietary supplement <b>tocotrienols</b> indicate potential for anti-disease activity. <b>Tocotrienols</b> have lower bioavailability in blood, potential for anticoagulant effects, and appear to be safe and well-tolerated.|$|R
40|$|As a minor {{component}} of vitamin E, <b>tocotrienols</b> were evident in exhibiting biological {{activities such as}} neuroprotection, radio-protection, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and lipid lowering properties which are not shared by tocopherols. However, available data on the therapeutic window of <b>tocotrienols</b> remains controversial. It {{is important to understand}} the absorption and bioavailability mechanisms before conducting in-depth investigations into the therapeutic efficacy of <b>tocotrienols</b> in humans. In this review, we updated current evidence on the bioavailability of <b>tocotrienols</b> from human studies. Available data from five studies suggested that <b>tocotrienols</b> may reach its target destination through an alternative pathway despite its low affinity for α-tocopherol transfer protein. This was evident when studies reported considerable amount of <b>tocotrienols</b> detected in HDL particles and adipose tissues after oral consumption. Besides, plasma concentrations of <b>tocotrienols</b> were shown to be higher when administered with food while self-emulsifying preparation of <b>tocotrienols</b> was shown to enhance the absorption of <b>tocotrienols.</b> Nevertheless, mixed results were observed based on the outcome from 24 clinical studies, focusing on the dosages, study populations and formulations used. This {{may be due to the}} variation of compositions and dosages of <b>tocotrienols</b> used, suggesting a need to understand the formulation of <b>tocotrienols</b> in the study design. Essentially, implementation of a control diet such as AHA Step 1 diet may influence the study outcomes, especially in hypercholesterolemic subjects when lipid profile might be modified due to synergistic interaction between <b>tocotrienols</b> and control diet. We also found that the bioavailability of <b>tocotrienols</b> were inconsistent in different target populations, from healthy subjects to smokers and diseased patients. In this review, the effect of dosage, composition and formulation of <b>tocotrienols</b> as well as study populations on the bioavailability of <b>tocotrienols</b> will be discussed...|$|R
50|$|In nature, <b>tocotrienols</b> {{are present}} in many plants and fruits. The palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis) is {{particularly}} high in <b>tocotrienols,</b> primarily gamma-tocotrienol, alpha-tocotrienol and delta-tocotrienol. Other cultivated plants high in <b>tocotrienols</b> includes rice, wheat, barley, rye and oat. In anatto however, <b>tocotrienols</b> are relatively abundant (only delta- and gamma-tocotrienol) and it contains no tocopherols.|$|R

50|$|Chemically, {{different}} analogues {{of vitamin}} E all show some activity as a chemical antioxidant, {{but do not}} {{all have the same}} vitamin E equivalence. Alpha-Tocopherol is the form of vitamin E that has the highest biological activity and is preferentially absorbed and accumulated in humans.2 Like tocopherols, individual <b>tocotrienol</b> isomers demonstrate different bioavailability and efficacy {{depending on the type of}} antioxidant performance being measured. All <b>tocotrienol</b> and tocopherol isomers have some physical antioxidant activity due to an ability to donate a hydrogen atom (a proton plus electron) from the hydroxyl group on the chromanol ring, to free radical and reactive oxygen species. Historically studies of tocotrienols account for less than 1% of all research into vitamin E. A scientific compilation of <b>tocotrienol</b> research, Tocotrienols: Vitamin E Beyond Tocopherols, was published in 2013.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tocotrienols</b> and {{tocopherols}} are isoforms {{of vitamin}} E. Vitamin E may exhibit antioxidant, prooxidant and non-antioxidant activities depending upon circumstances. In this study, {{the effect of}} <b>tocotrienols</b> and α-tocopherol on the activities of HMG CoA reductase and cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase was investigated. Pure <b>tocotrienols</b> were isolated from {{palm fatty acid distillate}} and pure α-tocopherol was obtained commercially. Guinea pigs were treated with different dosages of <b>tocotrienols</b> and α-tocopherol. After the treatment period, animals were sacrificed and liver microsomes were prepared. HMG CoA reductase and cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase were assayed using tracer techniques. Our results showed that the effects of <b>tocotrienols</b> and α-tocopherol on the activities of both the enzymes were dose-dependent. At low dosages, both <b>tocotrienols</b> and α-tocopherol exhibited an inhibitory effect on both the enzymes. Moreover, <b>tocotrienols</b> were a much stronger inhibitors than α-tocopherol. At high dosages, on the other hand, <b>tocotrienols</b> and α-tocopherol showed opposite effects on the enzymes. While <b>tocotrienols</b> continued to exhibit an inhibitory effect, α-tocopherol actually exhibited a stimulatory effect on both the enzymes. A possible explanation for this observation is suggested...|$|R

50|$|<b>Tocotrienol</b> studies confirm anti-oxidation {{and suggest}} {{anti-cancer}} effects than the common forms of tocopherol {{due to their}} chemical structure. The unsaturated side-chain in tocotrienols causes them to penetrate tissues with saturated fatty layers more efficiently.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tocotrienols</b> {{have only}} a single chiral center, which exists at the 2' {{chromanol}} ring carbon, {{at the point where}} the isoprenoid tail joins the ring. The other two corresponding centers in the phytyl tail of the corresponding tocopherols do not exist due to <b>tocotrienol's</b> unsaturation at these sites. <b>Tocotrienols</b> extracted from natural sources always consist of the dextrorotatory enantiomers only.

40|$|The vitamin E family {{consists}} of eight isomers known as alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienols. Numerous studies {{focused on the}} health benefits of these isomers have been performed since the discovery of vitamin E in 1922. Recent discoveries on the potential therapeutic applications of <b>tocotrienols</b> have revolutionized vitamin E research. Nevertheless, despite the abundance of literature, only 1 % of vitamin E research has been conducted on <b>tocotrienols.</b> Many new advances suggest that the use of <b>tocotrienols</b> for health improvement or therapeutic purposes is promising. Although the mechanisms of action of <b>tocotrienols</b> in certain disease conditions have been explored, more detailed investigations into the fundamentals of the health-promoting effects of these molecules must be elucidated before they can be recommended for health improvement or for the treatment or prevention of disease. Furthermore,many of the studies on the effects of <b>tocotrienols</b> have been carried out using cell lines and animal models.

40|$|Vitamin E {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an essential vitamin since their discovery in 1922. Although the functions of tocopherols are well established, <b>tocotrienols</b> have been the unsung heroes of vitamin E. Due to their structural differences, <b>tocotrienols</b> were reported to exert distinctive properties compared to tocopherols. While most vegetable oils contain higher amount of tocopherols, <b>tocotrienols</b> were found abundantly in palm oil. Nature has made palm vitamin E to contain up to 70 % of total <b>tocotrienols,</b> among which alpha-, gamma- and delta-tocotrienols are the major constituents. Recent advancements have shown their biological properties in conferring protection against cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, oxidative stress and immune regulation.

50|$|Tocotrienols, {{although}} less commonly known, also {{belong to}} the vitamin E family. Tocotrienols have four natural 2' d-isomers (they have a stereoisomeric carbon only at the 2' ring-tail position). The four tocotrienols (in order of decreasing methylation: d-alpha, d-beta, d-gamma, and d-delta-tocotrienol) have structures corresponding to the four tocopherols, except with an unsaturated bond {{in each of the}} three isoprene units that form the hydrocarbon tail, whereas tocopherols have a saturated phytyl tail (the phytyl tail of tocopherols gives the possibility for 2 more stereoisomeric sites in these molecules that tocotrienols do not have). <b>Tocotrienol</b> has been subject to fewer clinical studies and seen less research as compared to tocopherol. However, there is growing interest in the health effects of these compounds.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin E {{exists in}} nature in eight forms, {{each of which}} {{consists}} of a head section joined to either a saturated (phytyl) or an unsaturated (farnesyl) tail. The four compounds with the saturated tails are the tocopherols, and the four compounds with the unsaturated tails are the tocotrienols. There are four unique dihydrocoumarin head sections, distinguished by one of four substitution patterns and designated as α, β, γ, or δ. The alpha- forms are distinguished by their three substituted methyl groups and the delta- forms by their one substituted methyl group. The beta- and gamma- forms both have two substituted methyl groups, although at different structural positions (5,8-dimethyl and 7,8-dimethyl, respectively), making both beta / gamma <b>tocotrienol</b> {{as well as the}} beta / gamma tocopherol pairs of stereoisomer.|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effect of}} dietary tocopherols and <b>tocotrienols</b> on the lipid stability of pre-cooked chicken breast and thigh. The birds were supplemented with one of two doses of a commercial mixture of tocopherols and <b>tocotrienols</b> (Oryza 1, Oryza 2) or one of two doses of all-rac alpha-tocopherol acetate (Toc 1, Toc 2). Diets were formulated so that Oryza 1 and Toc 1 and Oryza 2 and Toc 2 contained similar tocopherol concentrations. No quantifiable amounts of <b>tocotrienols</b> were found in either breast or thigh muscles. <b>Tocotrienols</b> present in the diet reduced muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration. The effect of Oryza 1 on the tocopherol content in muscle and on its lipid stability was not significant. The Oryza 2, Toc 1 and Toc 2 diets increased the alpha- and gamma-tocopherol in breast and thigh muscles and enhanced their lipid stability. This improvement was only due to the antioxidant action of the tocopherols. Lipid stability of pre-cooked chicken was not enhanced by adding <b>tocotrienols</b> to a tocopherol supplement.

Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized equally into six groups. The baseline was sacrificed upon receipt. All other groups were ovariectomized, except for the sham group. The ovariectomized groups were administered orally daily with (1) lovastatin 11 mg/kg/day alone; (2) <b>tocotrienol</b> derived from annatto bean (annatto <b>tocotrienol)</b> 60 mg/kg/day alone; (3) lovastatin 11 mg/kg/day, and annatto <b>tocotrienol</b> 60 mg/kg/day. The sham and ovariectomized control groups were treated with equal volume of vehicle. After eight weeks of treatment, the rats were sacrificed. Their bones were harvested for bone dynamic histomorphometry and BMP- 2 gene expression. Rats supplemented with annatto <b>tocotrienol</b> and lovastatin concurrently demonstrated significantly lower single-labeled surface, but increased double-labeled surface, mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate compared to individual treatments (p < 0. 05). There was a parallel increase in BMP- 2 gene expression in the rats receiving combined treatment (p < 0. 05). The combination of annatto <b>tocotrienol</b> and lovastatin exerted either additively or synergistically on selected bone parameters.

40|$|<b>Tocotrienol,</b> {{a member}} of the vitamin E family of compounds, is {{currently}} receiving increased attention because of its highly promising anti-cancer effects. However, its potential in cancer therapy is limited by its poor bioavailability and its inability to specifically reach tumors at therapeutic concentrations after intravenous administration. In order to remediate to these problems, various delivery strategies have been proposed, such as the inclusion of <b>tocotrienol</b> in γ-cyclodextrins, prodrugs and emulsions, entrapment in lipid nanoparticles and vesicles. Among these approaches, we demonstrated that the entrapment of <b>tocotrienol</b> within vesicles bearing transferrin, whose receptors are overexpressed on numerous cancer cells, significantly improved the uptake by cancer cells overexpressing transferrin receptors. Consequently, the intravenous administration of <b>tocotrienol</b> entrapped in transferrin-bearing vesicles led to tumor regression and even complete tumor suppression in some cases in a murine tumor model, as well as improvement of animal survival.

Forty male rats were randomized into baseline (BL), sham (SH), orchidectomized (ORX), annatto tocotrienol-treated (AnTT) and testosterone enanthate-treated (TE) groups. The BL group was sacrificed upon receipt. All rats except the SH group underwent bilateral orchidectomy. Annatto <b>tocotrienol</b> at 60 mg/kg body weight was administered orally daily to the AnTT group for eight weeks. Testosterone enanthate at 7 mg/kg body weight was administered intramuscularly once weekly for eight weeks to the TE group.

40|$|Vitamin E is an {{essential}} nutrient with antioxidant activity. Vitamin E is comprised of eight members, -, -, -, and -tocopherols and -, -, -, and -tocotrienols. All forms of vitamin E are initially metabolized by -oxidation, which is catalyzed by cytochrome P 450 enzymes.
