5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> and <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> shield. <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to <b>the</b> <b>rib.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, {{leading to the}} development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved with the use of <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon. Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed.|$|E

50|$|The Intercostals are a set {{of muscles}} {{sandwiched}} among <b>the</b> <b>ribs.</b> They interconnect ribs, and are therefore the primary respiratory skeletal muscles. They are divided into the external and the internal subscapularis. The origin and insertion are in <b>the</b> <b>ribs.</b> <b>The</b> intercostals pull <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> backwards or forwards.|$|R
40|$|For a given loading, the {{stiffness}} of a plate or shell structure {{can be increased}} significantly by <b>the</b> addition of <b>ribs</b> or stiffeners. Hitherto, the optimization techniques are mainly on the sizing of <b>the</b> <b>ribs.</b> <b>The</b> more important issue of identifying the optimum location of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> has received little attention. In this investigation, a methodology has been developed for the automatic determination of the optimum locations of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> for a given boundary conditions...|$|R
5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, {{the right side of the}} skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the right side of the skull is very different from that of the left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E
5|$|Reagan was {{in great}} pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") left the White House for the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of <b>the</b> <b>rib.</b> The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} and internal interosseous intercostal muscles were separately stimulated at end-expiratory lung volume in anesthetized dogs. These muscles were all found to elevate <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> into which they insert. By attaching weights to <b>the</b> <b>ribs,</b> {{it was determined that}} the nonlinear compliance of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> was responsible for this phenomenon.

5|$|After {{recovering}} from <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> injury, Hughes pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre; he helped them win the 2008 International League title, earning the win after striking out 12 batters in the clinching game. On September 13, {{a day after}} the IL playoffs, Hughes was recalled by the Yankees. On September 17, Hughes made his first start since April 29, giving up one earned run over four innings and earning a no-decision in a 5–1 victory over the Chicago White Sox. In his final start of the season, on September 24, he gave up two runs in eight innings and received a no-decision in a ten-inning, 6–2 victory over Toronto. He finished the season with an 0–4 record, a 6.62 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in eight starts. Because injuries severely limited his workload during the season, the Yankees sent Hughes to the Arizona Fall League after the season to pitch more innings.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012 it was {{revealed}} that EA 32751 (Gebelein Man) had probably been murdered. A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the Cromwell Hospital in London showed that Gebelein Man had been aged about 18 to 20 {{at the time of his}} death and had been well muscled. Under his left shoulder blade the scan revealed a puncture to the body; the murder weapon had been used with such force that it had slightly damaged the shoulder blade but had shattered <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury had been caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12cm in length and 2cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the British Museum's expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein Man had been taken by surprise by the attack as there were no defense wounds.|$|E
5|$|Inconsistent {{inheritance}} of myostatin mutations (for example, F94L in Limousins, nt821 in Angus, and Q204X in Charolais) by progeny {{is expected to}} result in possible BLUP prediction errors for EBVs and EPDs equalling or exceeding worst case standard errors of prediction. For example, average rib eye area for Limousins in US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) trials during the 1980s and early 1990s {{is reported to be}} 12.3in2, and the reported possible difference in rib eye area in progeny arising from {{inheritance of}} either two F94L mutations or two normal myostatin genes from heterozygous parents is estimated to be 1.8in2 (12.3in2 x 15%). This difference, which is unpredictable without DNA testing, is nearly four times the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy, reported to be 0.46in2 for <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> eye EPD.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Congenital {{anomalies}} of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> are not {{so common}} but they are usually discovered as an incidental finding on routine radiography. Bicipital rib results due to fusion of cervical <b>rib</b> with <b>the</b> first <b>rib</b> or <b>the</b> first <b>rib</b> with <b>the</b> second. Its occurrence is not uncommon and more frequently unilateral. Observation: During routine course of osteology teaching we observed that <b>the</b> first <b>rib</b> had fused with the superior surface of second <b>rib,</b> on <b>the</b> left side.

40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} {{view that}} {{all parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> originate from <b>the</b> sclerotome of the thoracic somites has recently been challenged by an alternative view suggesting that only <b>the</b> proximal <b>rib</b> derives from <b>the</b> sclerotome, while <b>the</b> distal <b>rib</b> arises from regions of the dermomyotome. In view of this continuing controversy and {{to learn more about}} the cell interactions during rib morphogenesis, this study aimed to reveal the precise contributions made by somitic cells to <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> and associated tissues of the thoracic cage. A replication-deficient lacZ-encoding retrovirus was utilized to label cell populations within distinct regions of somites 19 – 26 in stage 13 – 18 chick embryos. Analysis of the subsequent contributions made by these cells revealed that the thoracic somites are the sole source of cells for <b>the</b> <b>ribs.</b> More precisely, it is the sclerotome compartment of the somites that contributes cells to both the proximal and distal elements of <b>the</b> <b>ribs,</b> confirming <b>the</b> traditional view of the origin of <b>the</b> <b>ribs.</b> Results also indicate that the precursor cells of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> and intercostal muscles are intimately associated within the somite, a relationship that may be essential for proper <b>rib</b> morphogenesis. Finally, <b>the</b> data from this study also show that <b>the</b> distal <b>ribs</b> are largely subject to resegmentation, although cell mixing may occur at the most sternal extremities...|$|R
50|$|The shell has {{a smooth}} appearance. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> are rather solid, obtuse, with wider interspaces. The {{color of the}} shell is {{yellowish}} brown, broad banded with chestnut. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> are lighter colored than the interstices.|$|R
5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} suggested {{evidence of}} Columbian mammoth butchering in America (from Lovewell, Kansas) dates from 18,000 to 21,000 years ago. Paleoamericans of the Clovis culture, which arose roughly 7,000 years later, {{may have been}} the first humans to hunt mammoths extensively. These people are thought to have hunted Columbian mammoths with Clovis pointed spears which were thrown or thrust. Although Clovis points have been found with Columbian mammoth remains at several sites, archaeologists disagree about whether the finds represent hunting, scavenging dead mammoths, or are coincidental. A female mammoth at the Naco-Mammoth Kill Site in Arizona, found with eight Clovis points near its skull, shoulder blade, ribs and other bones, is considered the most convincing evidence for hunting. In modern experiments, replica spears have been able to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> cages of African elephants with re-use causing little damage to the points.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>ribs,</b> <b>the</b> costal cartilages vary {{in their}} length, breadth, and direction.|$|R
5000|$|By {{analogy with}} the {{anatomical}} definition of [...] "rib", <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> attach to <b>the</b> main spar, and by being repeated at frequent intervals, form a skeletal shape for <b>the</b> wing. Usually <b>ribs</b> incorporate <b>the</b> airfoil {{shape of the}} wing, and the skin adopts this shape when stretched over <b>the</b> <b>ribs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The stout shell has a white tip. The whorls are whitish and {{the summits}} of <b>the</b> five <b>ribs</b> are brownish. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> are {{continuous}} from base to summit and the cross-section {{of the shell}} forms an exact pentagon with roundedangles. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> are not continuous, except accidentally. The other characters are closely similar to Fenimorea pagodula (Dall, 1889) ...|$|R
5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. <b>The</b> <b>rib</b> fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
40|$|Heat {{and mass}} {{transfer}} in natural convection vertical channels was investigated {{by means of}} two-dimensional CFD simulations aided by optimization algorithms. The channel was immersed in air, enclosed between an adiabatic smooth wall and an isothermally heated <b>ribbed</b> wall. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> were perpendicular to the fluid flow and their height, width, pitch, thermal conductivity and lateral wall inclination were variable. Also the smooth heated wall channel was studied and compared with <b>the</b> <b>ribbed</b> one. <b>The</b> existence of an optimal channel width for a given channel height and rib geometry was shown. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for <b>the</b> <b>ribbed</b> and <b>the</b> smooth channels. Optimization was applied to <b>the</b> <b>ribbed</b> channel problem {{in order to maximize}} the heat and the mass transfer through a multi-objective genetic algorithm. It was found that the presence of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> penalizes <b>the</b> channel performance so that no <b>ribbed</b> channel over-performed <b>the</b> smooth one...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{eleventh}} <b>rib</b> and <b>the</b> twelfth <b>rib,</b> <b>the</b> floating <b>ribs,</b> have {{a single}} articular facet on the head, which is of rather large size. They have no necks or tubercles, and are pointed at their anterior ends. The eleventh has a slight angle and a shallow costal groove, whereas the twelfth does not. <b>The</b> twelfth <b>rib</b> is much shorter than <b>the</b> eleventh <b>rib,</b> and its head is inclined slightly downward.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell is}} {{strongly}} biangulated {{on the body}} whorl. <b>The</b> <b>ribs</b> are distant and conspicuous. The revolving sculpture is fine and close. The color of the shell is whitish or yellowish. The interstices of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> ofte nare chestnut-colored.|$|R
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Spinosaurus was {{primarily}} a terrestrial predator or a piscivore, as indicated by its elongated jaws, conical teeth and raised nostrils. The hypothesis of spinosaurs as specialized fish eaters has been suggested before by A. J. Charig and A. C. Milner for Baryonyx. They base this on the anatomical similarity with crocodilians {{and the presence of}} digestive acid-etched fish scales in <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> cage of the type specimen. Large fish are known from the faunas containing other spinosaurids, including the Mawsonia, in the mid-Cretaceous of northern Africa and Brazil. Direct evidence for spinosaur diet comes from related European and South American taxa. Baryonyx was found with fish scales and bones from juvenile Iguanodon in its stomach, while a tooth embedded in a South American pterosaur bone suggests that spinosaurs occasionally preyed on pterosaurs, but Spinosaurus was likely to have been a generalized and opportunistic predator, possibly a Cretaceous equivalent of large grizzly bears, being biased toward fishing, though it undoubtedly scavenged and took many kinds of small or medium-sized prey. A study by Cuff and Rayfield (2013) concluded that bio-mechanical data suggests that Spinosaurus was not an obligate piscivore and that its diet was more closely associated with each individual's size. The characteristic rostral morphology of Spinosaurus allowed its jaws to resist bending in the vertical direction, however its jaws were poorly adapted with respect to resisting lateral bending.|$|E
5|$|The trachea and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front and sides of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> cage, the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E
25|$|The breasts {{should be}} {{supported}} {{primarily by the}} band around <b>the</b> <b>rib</b> cage, {{rather than by the}} shoulder straps.|$|E
50|$|The whorls {{are rather}} {{narrowly}} shouldered, the shoulder-angle sharp pointed by <b>the</b> <b>ribs,</b> which attain <b>the</b> suture. The interstices of <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> show revolving striae. The {{color of the}} shell is yellowish brown, with a broad superior darker band.|$|R
50|$|The costal {{cartilage}}s are bars {{of hyaline}} cartilage that serve to prolong <b>the</b> <b>ribs</b> forward {{and contribute to}} the elasticity of the walls of the thorax. Costal cartilage is only found at the anterior ends of <b>the</b> <b>ribs,</b> providing medial extension.|$|R
