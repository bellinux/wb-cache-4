5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E
5|$|The prince began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a unifier {{towards the}} middle of the 19th century. Such an {{interpretation}} is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E

500|$|Opposition <b>to</b> what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a Shona {{takeover}} immediately erupted around Matabeleland. The Matabele unrest led to {{what has}} become known as Gukurahundi ( [...] chaff before the spring rains").|$|R
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|Umran {{was first}} given {{the command of}} the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was {{promoted}} in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, {{one of the new}} members of the Military Committee, was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control—several hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a crash course in military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, a dizzying promotion for a man in his thirties. Considering that the members of the Military Committee were all too young <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the Military Committee appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior.|$|E

25|$|In Rublev's art two {{traditions are}} combined: the highest asceticism and the classic harmony of Byzantine mannerism. The {{characters}} {{of his paintings}} are always peaceful and calm. After some time his art came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the ideal of Eastern Church painting and of Orthodox iconography.|$|E
25|$|Alexei's {{character}} {{was not intended}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> an individual, but rather, a symbol to the entire Soviet people: he was depicted as an archetypal worker; his date of birth is given as 25 October 1917 by the Julian Calendar, {{the day of the}} October Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Today, many Bedouin call {{themselves}} 'Negev Arabs' rather than 'Bedouin', explaining that 'Bedouin' identity is intimately tied {{in with a}} pastoral nomadic way of life – {{a way of life}} they say is over. Although the Bedouin in Israel continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> nomads, today all of them are fully sedentarized, and about half are urbanites.|$|E

25|$|Later, the Pentecostal Movement {{emerged from}} the Holiness Movement, {{teaching}} that the believer could, in addition to becoming sanctified, receive power from God and the Gifts of the Holy Spirit. In early Pentecostal thought this was sometimes {{considered to be a}} third work of grace but over time it has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the major component of the second experience.|$|E
25|$|Puck {{suggests}} a secret history of these routes, for unsurprisingly they attracted long extant folk lore, running {{not only through}} the physical countryside but also through the invisible geography, the 'mental terrain', of pre-industrial country-folk. Shakespeare's lines leave {{little doubt that the}} physical corpse roads came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> being spirit routes, taking on qualities which lingered in the folklore of his age and which he incorporated into his play knowing {{that it would be a}} familiar concept.|$|E
25|$|The Progressive Canadian party aims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the {{successor}} {{party to the}} Progressive Conservatives. However, it does not enjoy broad support among former Progressive Conservatives. In particular, no prominent anti-merger Progressive Conservatives such as Joe Clark or David Orchard {{are associated with the}} Progressive Canadian Party, nor are any sitting MPs or senators. The most prominent members to join were to 1970s and 1980s era politicians: former cabinet minister Sinclair Stevens and former junior cabinet minister, Heward Grafftey, who polled near or below Craig Chandler in the final PC Party leadership race.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, {{consumerism}} became {{prominent in}} the United States, after its industrialisation. Market economies flourished.

25|$|For {{model year}} 1990, the Debonair {{was joined by}} a new, more modern looking and {{sporting}} executive sedan, called the Mitsubishi Diamante (also known as the Sigma) {{in an attempt to}} keep Mitsubishi competitive with new executive sedans, such as the Honda Legend and other Japanese luxury sedans as the Debonair continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> dated in appearance. The motivation to introduce a modern looking, executive level luxury sedan also took place in what has become known as the Japanese asset price bubble period that began after the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Julian Jaynes, {{primarily}} {{in his book}} The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, proposed that religion (and some other psychological phenomena such as hypnosis and schizophrenia) is a remnant of a relatively recent time in human development, prior to the advent of consciousness. Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, ancestors, etc.|$|E
25|$|The frontal view of {{the figures}} in paintings, sculptures, and relief is not an {{invention}} of the Parthians. In the ancient Near East the custom was to depict figures in the profile view, although the frontal view was always present to some degree, especially in sculpture. The frontal {{view of the}} flat {{was used in the}} ancient Near East to highlight certain figures. Daniel Schlumberger argues that these are always special figures which particular attention given <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> larger than life and more important than other figures in the depiction. The figures, gods and heroes, depicted frontally were not simple copies of life in a different material, they were instead meant to be viewed by the observer as alive. They were virtually present.|$|E

50|$|The Free Church of England {{was founded}} principally by Evangelical or Low Church clergy and congregations in {{response}} <b>to</b> what <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> attempts (inspired by the Oxford Movement) to re-introduce Roman Catholic dogmas and practices into the Established Church.

25|$|Since the mid-20th century many {{scholars}} like Marian Wenzel, the world's once leading {{authority on the}} art and artifacts of medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina, concluded that the stećci tombstones were a common tradition amongst Catholic, Orthodox and Bosnian Church followers alike. Wenzel's conclusion supported other historians' claims that they reflect a regional cultural phenomenon rather than belonging to a particular religious faith. Sometime the inscriptions/motifs do reveal the confessional affiliation of necropolis/deceased {{to one of the}} three Church organizations in medieval Bosnia and Zachlumia. This interconfessionality of stećci is one of their most remarkable features, and indicates high degree of Christianization of medieval Bosnian community. However, it is considered that there is not enough basis <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> exclusively Christian.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} {{late in the}} Middle Ages that Götaland began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a part of Sweden. In Old Norse and in Old English sources, Gautland/Geatland is still treated as a {{separate}} country from Sweden. In Sögubrot af Nokkrum for instance, Kolmården between Svealand and Östergötland is described as the border between Sweden and Ostrogothia (...Kolmerkr, er skilr Svíþjóð ok Eystra-Gautland...), and in Hervarar saga, King Ingold I rides to Sweden through Östergötland: Ingi konungr fór með hirð sína ok sveit nokkura ok hafði lítinn her. Hann reið austr um Smáland ok í eystra Gautland ok svá í Svíþjóð. In 1384 Bo Jonsson (Grip) stated in his will that the kingdom consisted of Swerige (Sweden, i.e. Svealand), Österland (i.e. Finland) and Göthaland (i.e. Götaland).|$|E
25|$|Rodion's {{political}} case resurfaced during polemics {{launched by}} the Romanian antisemites and the antisemitic fascists, down {{to the end of}} World War II. Poet and Premier Octavian Goga outlined his self-declared hatred for the Jews and call for discriminatory policies in his political tracts, but, unusually in this context, stated that he held no such grudge against either Rodion or Ronetti Roman. According to Radu Cosașu, Rodion's failure to integrate announced the similar drama of 1930s Jewish writer Mihail Sebastian, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> Romanian but was in return vilified by the far right. In 1941, the authoritarian regime of Ion Antonescu published a directory of Jewish Romanian authors, living or deceased, whose work was officially banned: Steuerman was included, under the erroneous spelling Steverman.|$|E

50|$|Kästner {{began to}} publish less and less, {{partly because of}} his {{increasing}} alcoholism. He did not join any of the post-war literary movements in West Germany, and in the 1950s and 1960s he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> mainly <b>as</b> an author of children's books.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from some}} politics-related debates of the 1970s Nocedal does not figure {{prominently}} in contemporary Spanish historiography {{since he is}} firmly classified as ultraconservative Catholic politician. This {{is not the case}} of Integrism itself, by some scholars viewed as a temporary offshoot branch of Carlism, and by some as a grouping with clearly separate ideological identity. The very term “Traditionalism” <b>is</b> subject <b>to</b> related constant confusion, as it <b>is</b> applied <b>to</b> the nocedalistas, to another 1919 breakaway Carlist group the mellistas, <b>to</b> what <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> mainstream Carlism, <b>to</b> what <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> all manifestations of non-mainstream Carlism, to non-dynastical Carlism, to Carlism and Integrism distinguished but combined, to a broad Catholic conservative movement encompassing Carlism to Basque nationalism, to Alfonsist Catholic monarchism or is simply used interchangeably with “Carlism”.|$|R
