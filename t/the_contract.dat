40|$|<b>The</b> <b>contracting</b> {{process is}} a crucial step in {{alliance}} development and its success. However, the existing literature reveals surprisingly little investigation into how organizational learning relates to <b>the</b> process of <b>contract</b> making. We therefore conducted an in-depth longitudinal study of <b>the</b> alliance <b>contracting</b> process in <b>the</b> animated film industry. First, {{our findings suggest that}} during <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> process, firms can learn about the way to deal with <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> process, about themselves and their partner, and about the transaction features. Second, the case analysis indicates a combination of experiential, vicarious, and inferential learning mechanisms. Combining these insights into the objects and the mechanisms of learning during <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> process, we discuss how contracting and learning processes are related and analyze the role of <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> process in supporting organizational learning. The findings show that the drafting of contractual clauses fosters learning and, in turn, this learning triggers new contractual negotiations. Hence we suggest that the alignment between transaction features and the choice of contractual governance results from learning during <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> process. We then propose avenues for future research. ...|$|R

40|$|Let X be {{a proper}} CAT(0) space and let G be a cocompact group of isometries of X which acts {{properly}} discontinuously. Charney and Sultan constructed a quasi-isometry invariant boundary for proper CAT(0) spaces which they called <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> boundary. <b>The</b> <b>contracting</b> boundary imitates <b>the</b> Gromov boundary for δ-hyperbolic spaces. We will make this comparison more precise by establishing some well known {{results for the}} Gromov boundary {{in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> boundary. We show that the dynamics on <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> boundary is very similar to that of a δ-hyperbolic group. In particular the action of G on ∂_cX is minimal if G is not virtually cyclic.
