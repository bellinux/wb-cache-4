5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bog</b> turtle is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and painted turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle. <b>The</b> <b>bog</b> turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bog</b> People: Iron-Age Man Preserved is {{an archaeological}} study of <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> bodies of Northern Europe {{written by the}} Danish {{archaeologist}} P.V. Glob. First published in 1965 by Gyldendal under the Danish title of Mosefolket: Jernalderens Mennesker bevaret i 2000 År, it was translated into English by the English archaeologist Rupert Bruce-Mitford and published by Faber and Faber in 1969. In 1966 it was translated into German by Thyra Dohrenburg and published by Winkler Werlag Munich under the title Die Schläfer im Moor (English: The Sleepers in <b>the</b> <b>Bog).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{accounts}} {{are a bit}} at odds about what Gongor's occupation at <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan's court was: accountant and keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan's elephant, <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan's bodyguard, or wrestler. In 1913, he travelled to Russia with a delegation headed by Sain Noyon Khan Namnansüren. Later, {{he is said to}} have worked at the toll office.|$|R
50|$|Especially {{valuable}} for nature conservation, are <b>the</b> raised <b>bogs</b> formed by <b>the</b> restoration of former marshland. The conditions are favorable for this, as <b>the</b> <b>bogs</b> in <b>the</b> park are less impacted by human use than <b>the</b> <b>bogs</b> of <b>the</b> Lower Saxony plain. When wood became scarce in the Harz, the locals {{tried to take}} advantage of <b>the</b> peat <b>bogs.</b> This proved unprofitable due to the low calorific value of peat and the weather conditions in the High Harz. <b>The</b> <b>bogs</b> in <b>the</b> Harz are of international significance by virtue of their distinctiveness and flora.|$|R
2500|$|The wetland {{known as}} <b>the</b> Quaking <b>Bogs</b> {{is an area}} of great {{environmental}} importance. <b>The</b> <b>bogs,</b> which are actually a fen, are an area where vegetation and soil a few feet deep have covered over a small lake. [...] As such, the ground bounces slightly as one walks upon it. [...] Also near <b>the</b> <b>bogs</b> {{is an area of}} natural quicksand. <b>The</b> <b>Bogs</b> are located East of Camp Reneker on the Blue/White trail going from the south end of Camp Wolverine into Camp Reneker's [...] "B-Side".|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bog</b> turtle's {{karyotype}} {{is composed}} of 50 chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. <b>The</b> <b>bog</b> turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Cranes and capercaillies can {{be heard}} in <b>the</b> <b>bogs</b> during summertime. <b>The</b> willow grouse also inhabits <b>the</b> <b>bogs.</b> <b>The</b> park also has a hectare of fen, where Succisa pratensis, brown beak sedge, {{carnation}} sedge, moor rush, Scottish asphodel, and many rare mosses grow. Lauhanvuori is the southernmost habitat of the Scottish asphodel.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan {{appointed}} Namnansüren {{prime minister}} of Autonomous Mongolia in July 1912, replacing Da Lam Tserenchimed who, as minister of internal affairs, had acted as de facto head of government since the elevation of <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan as national leader in December 1911. [...] Other members of <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan's government included the Da Lam Tserenchimed (minister for internal affairs), Mijiddorjiin Khanddorj (minister for foreign affairs), Dalai-Van Gombosuren (defense minister), Dambyn Chagdarjav (finance minister), and Erdene Van Namsrai (minister of justice).|$|R
50|$|Khanddorj {{was strong}} Russophile and was distrusted {{by a number}} of high {{officials}} in <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan's government, especially Gonchigjalzangiin Badamdorj, minister of religion and state, who complained to <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan about Khanddorj's alleged treasonable intentions. As a result, in 1913 Khanddorj was removed as head of the Foreign Ministry and was {{not a member of the}} government delegation at the Treaty of Kyakhta conference in 1915. Soon after Khanddorj was allegedly assassinated, dying of poisoning after attending a reception at <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan's residence.|$|R
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood turtle shares with only <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle. It and <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{variations}} in mitochondrial DNA indicate {{low levels of}} genetic divergence among bog turtle colonies. This is unusual in species such as <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle, which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in bog turtle colonies). These conditions limit gene flow, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. Data indicate that <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle suffered dramatic reductions in numbers – a population bottleneck – as colonies were forced south {{in the face of}} glaciation. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post-Pleistocene expansion, as <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtles moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.|$|E
5000|$|Ungern, Mongolian lamas and princes brought <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan from Manjusri Monastery to Urga on February 21, 1921. On February 22 {{a solemn}} {{ceremony}} took place, restoring <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan to <b>the</b> throne. As {{a reward for}} ousting the Chinese from Urga, <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan granted Ungern the high hereditary title darkhan khoshoi chin wang {{in the degree of}} khan, and other privileges. Other officers, lamas and princes who had participated in these events also received high titles and awards. For seizing Urga, Ungern received from Semyonov the rank of Lieutenant-General. Mongolia was proclaimed an independent monarchy under the theocratic power of <b>Bogd</b> Khan, or <b>the</b> 8th <b>Bogd</b> Gegen Jebtsundamba Khutuktu.|$|R
50|$|Geomorphologists {{sometimes}} compare <b>the</b> Wauconda <b>Bog</b> with <b>the</b> nearby Volo <b>Bog,</b> also a National Natural Landmark {{located about}} 7 miles (11 km) north of <b>the</b> Wauconda <b>Bog.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>bogs</b> displays {{different stages of}} a <b>bog's</b> life cycle. <b>The</b> Wauconda <b>Bog,</b> unlike Volo Bog, no longer has any patches of open water; instead, layers of wet and damp peat support characteristic wetland plant forms such as tamarack, cattails, wetland orchids, yellow birch, and poison sumac.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khaanate of Mongolia was the {{government}} of Mongolia (Outer Mongolia) between 1911 and 1919, and again from 1921 to 1924. By the spring of 1911, some prominent Mongolian nobles including Prince Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren persuaded the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu to convene a meeting of nobles and ecclesiastical officials to discuss independence from the Manchu-led Qing China. On 30 November 1911 the Mongols established the Temporary Government of Khalkha. On December 29, 1911 the Mongols declared their independence from the collapsing Qing Empire following the Xinhai Revolution. They installed as theocratic sovereign <b>the</b> 8th <b>Bogd</b> Gegeen, highest authority of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, who took <b>the</b> title <b>Bogd</b> Khaan or [...] "Holy Ruler". <b>The</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khaan was last khagan of Mongolia. This ushered {{in the period of}} [...] "Theocratic Mongolia", also known as <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khaanate.|$|R
5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, and reeds, which grow thick and tall and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle's habitat, thus reducing the amount of food and protection available to the turtles.|$|E
5|$|The {{water in}} <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> {{is low in}} {{nutrients}} and high in acidity, which {{makes it difficult for}} most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> along with sedges, leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and viburnums. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Methods used to {{recreate}} <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle's habitat include: controlled burns {{to limit the}} growth of overshadowing trees and underbrush (thus bringing the habitat back to early successional); grazing livestock such as cows and goats in the desired habitat area (creating pockets of water and freshly churned mud); and promoting beaver activity, including dam construction in and around wetlands.|$|E
50|$|Ungern was an arch-conservative pan-monarchist who {{aspired to}} restore the Russian monarchy under Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia and to revive the Mongol Empire {{under the rule of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan. In February 1921 he {{expelled}} Chinese troops from Mongolia and restored the monarchic power of <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan.|$|R
50|$|Usually a regency {{would follow}} the death of <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan until his reincarnation had reached his majority; however, {{in this case the}} search for the reincarnation of <b>the</b> <b>Bogd</b> Khan was banned (his reincarnation was {{discovered}} in Tibet in 1936) and the country has maintained a republican constitution ever since.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{an internationally}} {{important}} bird area, with {{species such as}} golden eagle, merlin and ruff. <b>The</b> <b>bogs</b> are rich in cloudberries and cranberries. <b>The</b> <b>bogs</b> of Nätsi-Võlla host numerous migratory species, such as the tundra swan (Cygnus columbianus). It also sees an annual congregation of numerous wader species. <b>The</b> <b>bogs</b> are also home to {{a significant percentage of}} the total national breeding population of such species as common crane (Grus grus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa). Other birds found here are whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus), Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), Eurasian golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) ...|$|R
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle's habitat, {{as well as some}} shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E
5|$|The Moss {{contains}} several {{varieties of}} heather, {{as well as}} the purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. Ferns and gorse are common too, and in areas where peat has been cut in the past, there are bog mosses, <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> bean Menyanthus trifoliata, and marsh pennywort.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bog</b> turtle {{was noted}} in the 18th century by Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, a self-taught {{botanist}} and clergyman. Muhlenberg, who named more than 150North American plant species, was conducting {{a survey of the}} flora of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, when he discovered the small turtle. In 1801, Johann David Schoepff named Muhlenberg's discovery as Testudo muhlenbergii in Muhlenberg's honor.|$|E

5|$|Chat Moss {{makes up}} the largest area of prime {{farmland}} in Greater Manchester, but farming on the moss is in decline. In 2003, {{it was reported that}} of the 54farms on the moss, occupying , almost half the area of <b>the</b> <b>bog,</b> only three were growing vegetables. Others had turned to arable farming, turf growing or horse livery instead of salad and vegetable crops. Chat Moss also contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Richard Harlan {{renamed the}} turtle Emys muhlenbergii. The species was {{subsequently}} renamed to Calemys muhlenbergii by Louis Agassiz in 1857, and to Clemmys muhlenbergii by Henry Watson Fowler in 1906. Synonyms include Emys biguttata, named in 1824 by Thomas Say {{on the basis}} of a turtle from the vicinity of Philadelphia, and Clemmys nuchalis, described by Dunn in 1917 from near Linville, North Carolina. Today, there are various names for <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> turtle, including mud turtle, marsh turtle, yellowhead, and snapper.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Moss is a {{peat bog}} in Lindow, {{an area of}} Wilmslow, Cheshire, which {{has been used as}} common land since the medieval period. It formed after the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in {{north-east}} Cheshire and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice. Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity around the edge of Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity. Once covering over , <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> has now shrunk to a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from <b>the</b> <b>bog</b> was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised. Lindow Moss is a lowland raised mire; this type of peat bog often produces the best preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27bodies to be recovered from such areas.|$|E
