5|$|Fivefold {{repetition}} of position: Similar to the threefold-repetition rule, {{but in this}} case neither player needs to claim the draw; thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn.</b> This is a relatively recent (2014) addition to the FIDE rules.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Coolidge {{signed the}} bill, {{which became the}} Act of February 24, 1925, authorizing all three coins. This {{was the first time}} {{commemorative}} coin legislation covered more than one issue. A total of 300,000 for the California piece was authorized, with the coins <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> at face value on behalf of the Citizens' Committee by the San Francisco Clearing House Association or the Los Angeles Clearing House Association. The latter group of banks had in 1923 distributed the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar.|$|E
5|$|Part I {{authorised}} {{the establishment}} of County Associations under schemes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> up by the Army Council, and laid out the expected form of these associations and their areas of authority. It provided {{that they were to}} be funded centrally but could raise funds in their own right, and that any other regulations necessary for the administration of the associations were to be made by the Army Council. It explicitly stipulated that these associations were not to have operational command over the forces they administered.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> off first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The most {{traditional}} type of batik, called batik tulis (written batik), is drawn using only the canting. The cloth needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> on both sides, and dipped in a dye bath {{three to four}} times. The whole process may take up to a year; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped batik.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E

Of the seven directors of the corporation, two are elected, two are appointed by the Pichilemu City Council, and another two by the regional or provincial government, and the mayor presides as the seventh member. Longtime Pichilemu resident sculptor Macarena Irarrázabal Correa and Professor Carlos Leyton Labarca, native of the nearby village of Ciruelos and creator of the Museo del Niño Rural (Museum of the Rural Child), were elected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 479BC the Greeks {{assembled}} a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> into the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. Thinking the Greeks in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but the Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not believe any attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> into battles.|$|E

5|$|James IV {{brought in}} experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and {{established}} a gun foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer-range and smaller-calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden Field.|$|E
5|$|Lütjens {{then decided}} to move to a new area, as the {{surviving}} members of the dispersed convoy had sent distress signals. He chose the Cape Town-Gibraltar convoy route, and positioned himself to the northwest of Cape Verde. The two ships encountered another convoy, escorted by the battleship , on 8 March. Lütjens again forbade an attack, though he shadowed the convoy and directed U-boats to attack it. A pair of U-boats sank a total of 28,488GRT of shipping on the night of 7–8 March. Malaya turned on the two battleships and closed to , well within the range of the Germans' guns, but Lütjens refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> into an engagement. He instead turned toward the mid-Atlantic, where the two ships refueled from the tankers Uckermark and Ermland on 12 March.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{principal}} technologies that enabled an aircraft {{as large as the}} 747 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> up was the high-bypass turbofan engine. The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel. General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the JT9D to power the 747.|$|E
5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's refusal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> {{into open}} conflict, the insurgents {{needed time to}} {{reassess}} their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections {{by a vote of}} 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E
5|$|The Flight Superintendent and the Technical Superintendent of ANA {{simulated}} some {{of these}} events during a test flight in another DC-4. They were satisfied that the time intervals between events were compatible with the likely sequence of events leading to {{the crash of the}} Amana, and that it was a plausible explanation of the accident. However, on legal advice this possible explanation of the crash was not made public. Two accidents involving Douglas DC-4s, one approaching Dublin Airport, Ireland, in 1961 and another approaching Stockport Airport, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1967 were attributed to interruption of fuel supply when engines were supplied from the cross-feed system which was open to an empty fuel tank, allowing air <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> into the cross-feed pipe.|$|E
