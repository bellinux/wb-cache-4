5|$|When Seymour later arrives {{that morning}} {{suffering}} a toothache, Mushnick sends Seymour to Dr. Farb, {{who tries to}} remove several of his teeth without anesthetic to get even with Seymour for ruining Farb's flowers. Grabbing a sharp tool, Seymour fights back and accidentally stabs and kills Farb. Seymour is horrified that he has now murdered twice, and after posing as a dentist to avoid the suspicion of Farb's masochistic patient Wilbur Force, Seymour feeds Farb's body to Audrey Jr. The unexplained disappearances {{of the two men}} attract the attention of the police and Mushnick finds himself questioned by Sergeant Joe Fink and his assistant Officer Frank Stoolie (take-offs of Dragnet characters Joe Friday and Frank Smith,). Although Mushnick acts suspiciously nervous, Fink and Stoolie conclude that he knows nothing. Audrey Jr., which has grown several feet tall, is beginning <b>to</b> <b>bud,</b> as is the relationship between Seymour and Audrey (whom Seymour invites on a date).|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties <b>to</b> <b>bud</b> and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

25|$|Pinot Meunier {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely planted grapes in France but it is rather obscure to most wine {{drinkers}} and will rarely be seen on a wine label. The grape has been favored by vine growers in northern France due to its ability <b>to</b> <b>bud</b> and ripen more reliably than Pinot noir. The vine's tendency <b>to</b> <b>bud</b> later in the growing season and ripen earlier makes it less susceptible to developing coulure which can greatly reduce a prospective crop. For the last couple of centuries, Pinot Meunier has been the most widely planted Champagne grape, accounting for more than 40% of the region's entire plantings. It is most prevalent in the cooler, north facing vineyards of the Vallee de la Marne and in the Aisne department. It is also widely grown in the Aube region in vineyards where Pinot noir and Chardonnay would not fully ripen.|$|E

Despite having thin skinned berries, Pedro Ximénez is highly susceptible to the viticultural hazard of botrytis bunch rot as well as downy mildew, esca and eutypa dieback. The vine has some resistance to the fungal disease powdery mildew but is also very prone to damage caused by termite infection.|$|E

25|$|Once {{inside the}} hepatocyte, HCV takes over {{portions}} of the intracellular machinery to replicate. The HCV genome is translated to produce a single protein of around 3011 amino acids. The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an Alternate Reading Frame Protein (ARFP). HCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-4A serine protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template {{for the production of}} new positive strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated, further replicated or packaged within new virus particles. New virus particles are thought <b>to</b> <b>bud</b> into the secretory pathway and are released at the cell surface.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{faithful}} {{inheritance of}} organelles by daughter cells {{is essential to}} maintain the benefits afforded to eukaryotic cells by compartmentalization of biochemical functions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the class V myosin, Myo 2 p, is involved in transporting different organelles, including the peroxisome, along actin cables <b>to</b> the <b>bud.</b> We identified Inp 2 p as the peroxisome-specific receptor for Myo 2 p. Cells lacking Inp 2 p fail to partition peroxisomes <b>to</b> the <b>bud</b> but are unaffected in the inheritance of other organelles. Inp 2 p is a peroxisomal membrane protein, preferentially enriched in peroxisomes delivered <b>to</b> the <b>bud.</b> Inp 2 p interacts directly with the globular tail of Myo 2 p. Cells overproducing Inp 2 p often transfer their entire populations of peroxisomes <b>to</b> <b>buds.</b> The levels of Inp 2 p oscillate with the cell cycle. Organelle-specific receptors like Inp 2 p explain how a single motor can move different organelles in distinct and specific patterns. To our knowledge, Inp 2 p is the first peroxisomal protein implicated in the vectorial movement of peroxisomes...|$|R
25|$|Clarice is apprehended by Hartman and, upon disparaging both him and {{his dead}} daughter, is {{shot in the head}} as the others watch from a distance.

During their drive, the two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on the two with one of the bullets severing Jackson's face and causing the vehicle to careen {{off the side of the}} road. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah at the old barn where Betty was killed. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and then gathers the family to converge on Hartman's location. At the barn, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is soon incapacitated by the other Sawyers.|$|E
25|$|However, Castle's unique {{idea for}} the game {{somewhat}} side-stepped the potential legal problems. He didn't want to adapt the film; {{he wanted to make}} an original game set within the film's milieu. This would mean the game would not have to borrow as heavily from the film as it would were it a straight adaptation, hence avoiding the potential legal problems down the road. Virgin loved Castle's idea, and asked him to make a pitch <b>to</b> <b>Bud</b> Yorkin. Castle built a demo for the pitch, but rather than using footage from the film, he and his team created a rough opening cutscene based on the film's aesthetic style, but without recreating any exact scenes. According to Castle, going into the pitch, Yorkin was concerned about how much footage from the film would be needed for the game, but when he saw the demo, he was thrilled, and asked Castle if the whole game could be made in a similar manner. From that point forward, the development team had one overriding mandate; every scene in the game would be generated from scratch in 3D; no footage from the film would be used.|$|E
