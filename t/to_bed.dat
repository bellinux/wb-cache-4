40|$|We analyze {{directional}} dependence and scaling of air log permeability statistics characterizing minipermeameter measurements by Tidwell and Wilson {{on the faces}} of a 30 by 30 by 30 cm(3) size unsaturated block of Berea sandstone. We find distinct differences between the statistics and scaling behaviors of data measured on faces parallel and normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding,</b> and of incremental measurements in three orthogonal directions along these faces. Whereas the distribution on of data and their increments parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> are heavy tailed, those of increments normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> are Gaussian. Order q sample structure functions of increments parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> scale as powers xi(q) of directional lag, s(d), over limited ranges of s(d). Using moment and extended self-similarity methods of analysis we find xi(q) to be generally nonlinear in q, tending to be concave in q on faces normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> and convex on faces parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding.</b> Whereas the literature attributes nonlinear scaling of xi(q) with q to multifractals or fractional Laplace motions, we find the data to be consistent with sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to truncated (monofractal, self-affine) fractional Gaussian noise. The increments exhibit negative statistical dependence (antipersistence) that varies with direction parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> and is more pronounced on faces parallel than normal <b>to</b> <b>bedding...</b>|$|R

30|$|Our {{data also}} show that P-wave {{velocities}} parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> are higher than those measured perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>bedding,</b> and that water saturation increases P-wave velocity (Figs.  15, 16). Previous measurements on sandstones show that P-wave velocity is faster parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> (e.g. Benson et al. 2005). Since the grain major axis is typically sub-parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> in sandstones, elastic waves travelling perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> will encounter more grain-to-grain interfaces, which will reduce the elastic wave velocity. Such P-wave anisotropy in clay rich rocks, such as shale, has also been attributed to preferential clay alignment {{in the direction of}} bedding (Johnston and Christensen 1995). However, since the clay minerals in the Buntsandstein sandstones from EPS- 1 are present as pore-filling (e.g. Fig.  9 b, c, f, l) or pore-lining minerals (e.g. Figs  9 k, 10 b, e, d), it is unlikely that they are oriented with respect <b>to</b> <b>bedding.</b> This could explain why the ratio of parallel to perpendicular P-wave velocity is uninfluenced by clay content (Fig.  16 b).|$|R
30|$|Our {{data also}} {{highlight}} that {{five of the}} sandstones are more permeable when measured parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> than in the perpendicular direction (Fig.  14). The permeability of these samples is between a factor of three to five higher parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> in samples 84, 299, 453, and 540, and more than {{an order of magnitude}} higher in sample 347 (Fig.  14). Permeability measured parallel and perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> is very similar for the remaining samples (Fig.  14). The data of Griffiths et al. (2016) also highlight a permeability anisotropy within the Buntsandstein. For example, a sandstone from the Karlstal unit (depth =  1083  m) was about two orders of magnitude more permeable when measured parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> (Griffiths et al. 2016). However, understanding why some samples are more permeable parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding,</b> whilst others are not, is difficult to reconcile: permeability anisotropy is not related to connected porosity, clay content, or average grain size (Fig.  14). Further, of the five samples that show permeability anisotropy, some are homogenous (microscopically and on the sample length scale) (samples 84, 347, and 453; Fig.  8), whilst others are layered/laminated (299 and 540; Fig.  8). To emphasise, the sample that contains the most obvious laminations—sample 497 (Fig.  2 j)—is marginally less permeable when oriented parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> (Table  4).|$|R

30|$|Since {{the grains}} in {{sandstones}} are typically orientated such that their pore major axis is sub-parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> (Louis et al. 2003; Benson et al. 2005; Robion et al. 2014; Griffiths et al. 2017; Farrell and Healy 2017), a higher permeability parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> is perhaps expected. Although {{we do not}} provide an average orientation for the pore or grain major axes of the Buntsandstein sandstones studied herein, we do note that their average grain aspect ratios are within the range 1.54 – 1.76 (Table  1). Higher permeabilities parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding,</b> compared <b>to</b> measurements performed on samples prepared perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>bedding,</b> have been previously reported by Bell and Culshaw (1998). These authors showed that the permeability of sandstones (from the Sneinton Formation in England) {{with a range of}} connected porosity (from 0.09 to 0.14) was ~  40 to 60 % higher when measured parallel <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> (Bell and Culshaw 1998). Farrell et al. (2014) and Farrell and Healy (2017) also show that pore elongation through cataclasis and shearing can create a permeability anisotropy adjacent to faults in porous sandstone. However, data from Benson et al. (2005) show a permeability anisotropy in low-porosity (porosity =  0.04) Crab Orchard sandstone, but no permeability anisotropy in high-porosity (porosity =  0.23) Bentheim sandstone. As mentioned above, we only observed a substantial permeability anisotropy in one of the high-porosity samples (Fig.  14). We suggest that the absence of a permeability anisotropy in the sandstones of the Buntsandstein is likely a result of abundant pore-filling minerals found in these sandstones (Figs.  8, 9, and 10). The presence/absence of a permeability anisotropy in sandstone is likely therefore related to the shape of the grains (Table  1), a factor that dictates the shape of the pores (the inter-grain voids), and {{the nature and extent of}} pore-filling minerals.|$|R
