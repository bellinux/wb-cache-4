5|$|Between 1 October 1877 and 31 December 1906 some {{services}} on <b>the</b> <b>H</b> were extended to Richmond over the London and South Western Railway (L) via its station at Hammersmith (Grove Road).|$|E
5|$|Lawton is {{primarily}} served by Interstate 44, designated as <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> E. Bailey Turnpike. It connects {{the city to}} Oklahoma City to the northeast and to Wichita Falls, Texas, to the south. The city is also connected by US Highway 62, which connects to the regional towns of Altus {{to the west and}} Anadarko to the north. Other major thoroughfares include US Highway 277 and 281, which parallels <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> E. Bailey Turnpike to Wichita Falls to the south and leads to regional towns of Anadarko and Chickasha, respectively, to the north, and OK-7, which connects Lawton to Duncan.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 1999, Michaels made {{a special}} {{appearance}} for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling at the 10th Anniversary Show pay-per-view at the Yokohama Arena, {{serving as the}} guest referee for <b>the</b> <b>H</b> vs fake Hayabusa main event. He got himself involved in the match when fake Hayabusa delivered a low blow on him and he responded later on with Sweet Chin Music.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hs</b> 293 {{also served}} {{as the basis for}} a number of developments, none completed. These {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 294, [...] "designed specifically to penetrate the water and strike a ship below the waterline", with a long, conical shaped forebody and a pair of <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 293A's standard Walter HWK 109-507 booster engines at the wing roots; <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 295, with longer fuselage, larger warhead and <b>Hs</b> 294 wings; <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 296, with Hs 294 afterparts, Hs 295 warhead and Hs 293 Kehl-Straßurg MCLOS control systems.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 130 led to bomber variants. <b>The</b> planned <b>Hs</b> 130B {{was almost the}} same as <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 130A, but with a bomb bay {{in place of the}} camera bay, but was never built. <b>The</b> <b>Hs</b> 130C was built as a competitor for the [...] "Bomber B" [...] project, and was very different from <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 130A, featuring a shorter wing span, remotely controlled defensive armament, a more extensively glazed (but still pressurized) cabin and up to 4,000 kg (8,800 lb) of bombs. Three prototypes, V1, V2, and V3 were built, with V1 and V2 were powered by BMW 801 radials, and V3, featuring full armament, was powered with a pair of Germanys largest displacement — at some 44.5 litres apiece — inline inverted V-12s, the Daimler-Benz DB 603A engine. Further {{development of}} <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 130 as a reconnaissance aircraft continued with <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 130D, which was planned to have DB 605 engines and a complex two-stage supercharger, but was again unbuilt.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Henschel <b>Hs</b> 122 was a German army cooperation/reconnaissance {{aircraft}} of the mid-1930s, radial-engined {{and with}} a parasol wing. Though only pre-production variants entered service, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 122 led on to <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 126 which was produced in large numbers.|$|R
5|$|Several {{commercial}} mushroom ketchups {{were produced}} in the United Kingdom; some of the brands included Crosse and Blackswell's Mushroom Catsup, Morton's Mushroom Ketchup and Geo Watkins Mushroom Ketchup. Some of these companies exported their product to the United States, which created competition with ketchup products manufactured in the U.S. by <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> J. Heinz Company.|$|E
5|$|Sites at Watts Bar Dam, Muscle Shoals and Detroit were considered, but it {{was decided}} to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could be {{obtained}} from the Clinch River and steam from the K-25 power house. The thermal diffusion project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the Gulf Ordnance Plant in Mississippi, on a cost plus fixed fee contract. <b>The</b> <b>H.</b> A. Jones Construction Company would build the steam plant, with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would take six months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days.|$|E
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, <b>the</b> <b>H</b> class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. <b>The</b> <b>H</b> class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{tribute to}} <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 usefulness came in January 1943 when Generaloberst Wolfram von Richthofen, then commander-in-chief of Luftflotte 4, asked whether production of <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 could be restarted because <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 performed {{well in a}} theater where mud, snow, rain and ice took a heavy toll on the serviceability of more advanced aircraft. However, the Henschel factory had already dismantled all tools and jigs in 1940.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 was {{intended}} to replace the Heinkel He 50 biplane reconnaissance and dive bomber as well as acting as a [...] "stop-gap" [...] measure until the Junkers Ju 87 became available. As such, production was limited and no upgrades were considered, although an improved version, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123B was developed by Henschel in 1938. A proposal to fit the aircraft with a more powerful 716kW (960hp) [...] "K"-variant of its BMW 132 engine did not proceed beyond the prototype stage, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 V5. <b>The</b> V6 prototype fitted with a similar powerplant and featuring a sliding cockpit hood {{was intended}} to serve as <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123C prototype.|$|R
50|$|However, the Allies {{developed}} several {{electronic countermeasures}} against <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 293 and other radio guides weapons, such as electronic jammers. Those {{and the increasing}} Allied air superiority prevented <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 293 from having any significant impact in the later war years.|$|R
5|$|The GWR built a 6 MW {{power station}} at Park Royal and {{electrified}} {{the line between}} Paddington and Hammersmith and the branch from Latimer Road to Kensington (Addison Road). An electric service with jointly owned rolling stock started on <b>the</b> <b>H</b> on 5 November 1906. In the same year, the Met suspended running on the East London Railway, terminating instead at the District station at Whitechapel until that line was electrified in 1913. <b>The</b> <b>H</b> service stopped running to Richmond over the L on 31 December 1906, although GWR steam rail motors ran from Ladbroke Grove to Richmond until 31 December 1910.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>H</b> {{variant of}} the He 111 series was more widely {{produced}} and saw more action during World War II than any other Heinkel variant.|$|E
5|$|The cutbacks forced mission {{planners}} {{to reassess}} the original planned landing sites {{in order to}} achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions. Apollo 15 had been planned to be the last of <b>the</b> <b>H</b> series missions, but since there would be only two subsequent missions left, it was changed to the first of three J missions.|$|E
50|$|While {{trials of}} the two prototypes were not successful, the {{potential}} of a high altitude aircraft {{caught the attention of}} Theodor Rowehl, commander of the Luftwaffes special reconnaissance unit. Rowehls interest in <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 128s potential for high-altitude reconnaissance missions led Reich Air Ministry to instruct Henschel to continue development of <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 128 as a reconnaissance aircraft under <b>the</b> designation <b>Hs</b> 130A.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hs</b> 122 was <b>the</b> Henschel company's second aircraft, its first, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 121 {{not being}} {{intended}} for production. It was designed {{in response to}} a Reich Air Ministry call for a multi-role army co-operation aircraft to replace the ageing Heinkel He 46.|$|R
50|$|ESCI's 1:48 {{aircraft}} {{line had}} below-average accuracy and detailing {{in spite of}} the interesting themes (MiG-23, MiG-27) and eye-catching box art. The exception to this are the two crisp models of the famous Henschel ground attack aircraft, <b>the</b> (<b>Hs</b> 123 and <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 129).|$|R
5|$|These six {{ships were}} {{ordered by the}} Brazilian Navy, but on the {{outbreak}} of World War II, they were requisitioned by the Royal Navy. They are usually included with <b>the</b> <b>H</b> class.|$|E

5|$|Barnes thus {{played in}} four of the five Tests, missing the fourth Test through injury. He scored 329runs, {{averaging}} 82.25. During the first-class tour matches, Barnes's performance was less spectacular. In all first-class matches on the tour, he amassed 1354runs, averaging 56.41. Barnes made 176 in 255 minutes against Surrey early in the tour, but, apart from his Test hundred, his only other century came in the final tour match, when the final 50 runs of his 151 against <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> D. G. Leveson-Gower XI at the Scarborough cricket festival came in just 25 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Possible {{underlying}} causes include <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> and Ts.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Henschel <b>Hs</b> 117 Schmetterling (German for Butterfly) was a radio-guided German {{surface-to-air missile}} project {{developed}} during World War II. There {{was also an}} air-to-air version, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 117H.|$|R
2500|$|In their {{intended}} role, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123s {{proved to be}} somewhat of a failure, hampered by their small bomb capacity and short range. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123s based in Seville were used for ground support, a role in which their range was not such a detriment, and where the ability to accurately place munitions {{was more important than}} carrying a large load. The combat evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 demonstrated a remarkable resiliency in close-support missions, proving able to absorb a great deal of punishment including direct hits on the airframe and engine. The Nationalists in Spain were suitably impressed with <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 under battle conditions, purchasing the entire evaluation flight and ordering an additional 11 aircraft from Germany. <b>The</b> Spanish <b>Hs</b> 123s were known as [...] "Angelito" [...] (dear angel or little angel), and at least one Hs 123 was in service with the Ejército del Aire (Spanish Air Force) after 1945.|$|R
5|$|Bridgeport was {{delivered}} to the United States Maritime Commission (USMC) and entered the Reserve Fleet at Brunswick, Georgia on 16 April 1947. In November 1947, the ship was declared surplus by the WSA and stripped of all equipment and wire. Bridgeport was sold for scrapping on 13 February 1948 to <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> H. Buncher Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and withdrawn from USMC custody on 1 March 1948. She was dismantled at Mobile, Alabama later that same year.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Mobile was a Confederate city. <b>The</b> <b>H.</b> L. Hunley, {{the first}} {{submarine}} to sink an enemy ship, {{was built in}} Mobile. One {{of the most famous}} naval engagements of the war was the Battle of Mobile Bay, resulting in the Union taking control of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On April 12, 1865, three days after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the city surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction after Union victories at nearby Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely.|$|E
5|$|From 1 August 1872, the Middle Circle service {{also began}} {{operations}} through Gloucester Road, running from Moorgate along the MR's tracks {{on the north}} side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith & City Railway (H) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by <b>the</b> <b>H</b> and the DR.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{performance}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 V1 prototype prematurely eliminated any {{chance for the}} more conventional Fi 98, which was cancelled after a sole prototype had been constructed. During testing, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 proved capable of pulling out of [...] "near-vertical" [...] dives; however, two prototypes subsequently crashed due to structural failures in the wings that occurred when the aircraft were tested in high-speed dives. The fourth prototype incorporated improvements to cure these problems; principally, stronger centre-section struts were fitted. After it had been successfully tested, <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 123 was ordered into production with an 656kW (880hp) BMW 132Dc engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{inviscid}} limit {{problem for}} the smooth solutions of the Boussinesq system is studied in this paper.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hs</b> 293 {{was carried}} on Heinkel He 111, Heinkel He 177, Focke-Wulf Fw 200, and Dornier Do 217 planes. However, only the He 177 (of I and II.Gruppen/KG 40), certain {{variants}} of the FW 200 (of III./KG 40) and the Do 217 (of II./KG 100 and III./KG 100) used <b>the</b> <b>Hs</b> 293 operationally in combat.|$|R
5|$|In 1966, the Lawton City Council annexed {{several miles}} of {{land on the}} city's east, northeast, west, and {{northwest}} borders, expanding east beyond the East Cache Creek area and west to 82nd Street. On March 1, 1964, the north section of <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> E. Bailey Turnpike was completed, connecting Lawton directly to Oklahoma City, the capital. The south section of the turnpike leading to the Texas border was completed on April 23, 1964. Urban renewal efforts in the 1970s transformed downtown Lawton. A number of buildings dating to the city's founding were demolished to build an enclosed shopping mall.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, MBTA Framingham/Worcester Line and Amtrak {{operations}} were shifted {{to a new}} set of platforms nearby, which have high-level sections for handicapped-accessible boarding and a footbridge for crossing the tracks. This new Framingham station is among the busiest on the MBTA system, with 41 daily MBTA and 2 Amtrak trains on weekdays. <b>The</b> <b>H.</b> H. Richardson-designed station building remains largely intact and is currently used as a restaurant.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} British politics, the {{declaration}} {{resulted from the}} coming into power of Lloyd George and his Cabinet, which had replaced <b>the</b> <b>H.</b> H. Asquith led-Cabinet in December 1916. Whilst both Prime Ministers were Liberals and both governments were wartime coalitions, Lloyd George and Balfour, appointed as his Foreign Secretary, favoured a post-war partition of the Ottoman Empire as a major British war aim, whereas Asquith and his Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, had favoured its reform.|$|E
40|$|Astemizole, a H 1 R {{antagonist}} shows high affinity to <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 1 receptor {{but only}} a moderate affinity to <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 4 receptor. This study aims to modify the astemizole to keep high affinity to <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 1 receptor and to increase affinity to <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 4 receptor. Therefore, 13 astemizole-derived compounds and astemizole-JNJ 7777120 -derived hybrid compounds were synthesized and pharmacologically characterized at <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 1 and <b>H</b> 4 receptors. <b>The</b> new compounds show affinity to <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 1 receptor in the pK i range from 5. 3 to 8. 8, whereas the affinity of these compounds to <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 4 receptor was surprisingly rather low (pK i from 4. 4 to 5. 6). Three representative compounds were docked into <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 1 receptor and molecular dynamic studies were performed to explain the binding mode and the experimental results on a molecular level. Furthermore, {{taking into account the}} binding mode of compounds with high affinity to <b>the</b> histamine <b>H</b> 4 receptor, a H 1 /H 4 -pharmacophore hypothesis was developed...|$|R
