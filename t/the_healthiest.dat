5|$|Minnesotans {{have low}} rates of {{premature}} death, infant mortality, cardiovascular disease, and occupational fatalities.

5|$|The {{scene in}} which water is splashed in Leslie's face was only shot twice, because McCarthy-Miller said Poehler would start anticipating it in more takes {{and it would not}} have {{appeared}} spontaneous. The first time the scene was acted, the cameras were accidentally not turned on, so only one take was usable for the episode. During the banquet for the Tellenson Awards, a video is shown of an ill Tony Tellenson (for whom the award was named) in his hospital room. McCarthy-Miller shot the scene with minimal staff on a separate set. Multiple takes were filmed, and the severity of illness differed in each one. The final clip used in the episode shows Tellenson wearing a mask attached to an oxygen tank, which is one of <b>the</b> <b>healthiest</b> versions they filmed. The Jeanine Restrepo character was originally named Janet Restrepo, but was changed at the last moment. Poehler {{and the rest of the}} cast had already memorized the lines with the name Janet, and the actors had difficulty filming the scenes correctly as a result.|$|E

5|$|William Foster and William Eddy, both {{survivors}} of the snowshoe party, started from Bear Valley to intercept Reed, taking with them a man named John Stark. After one day, they met Reed helping his children, all frostbitten and bleeding but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to return to Truckee Lake with them. Halfway there they found the crudely mutilated and eaten remains of two children and Mrs. Graves, with one-year-old Elizabeth Graves crying beside her mother's body. Eleven survivors were huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two rescuers, hoping to save <b>the</b> <b>healthiest,</b> each took a child and left. John Stark refused to leave the others. Stark picked up two children and all the provisions, and assisted the nine remaining Breens and Graveses to Bear Valley.|$|E
5|$|Deeply in debt, William made {{multiple}} {{attempts at}} marrying a wealthy heiress such as Catherine Tylney-Long, but his suits were unsuccessful. Following {{the death of}} William's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales, then second-in-line to the British throne, in 1817, the king was left with twelve children, but no legitimate grandchildren. The race was on among the royal dukes to marry and produce an heir. William had great advantages in this race—his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives, who were both beyond childbearing age anyway, and William was <b>the</b> <b>healthiest</b> of the three. If he lived long enough, he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones, and {{have the opportunity to}} sire the next monarch. William's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. William's younger brother Adolphus, the Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father Frederick declined the match. Two months later, the Duke of Cambridge married Augusta himself. Eventually, a princess was found who was amiable, home-loving, and was willing to accept, even enthusiastically welcoming William's nine surviving children, several of whom had not yet reached adulthood. In the Drawing Room at Kew Palace on 11 July 1818, William married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the daughter of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. At 25, Adelaide was half William's age.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>healthiest</b> {{behaviors}} {{displayed by}} resilient {{families in the}} wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effects of {{clearing}} and skirting obstacles during the gait on the energetic cost of walking (ECW) of patients with chronic hemiplegia. The hypothesis was that hemiplegia would have a greatest increase in the ECW than in <b>the</b> <b>healthy</b> group. DESIGN: Fifteen healthy subjects and 17 patients with chronic hemiplegia completed two 6 -min walking sessions: one with obstacles and the other without obstacles. During both sessions, the patients were equipped with a portable gas analyzer to measure oxygen uptake (V˙o 2). Gait velocity and ECW were calculated. RESULTS: In both groups, gait velocity was lower in the with-obstacles condition and the ECW was significantly higher. V˙o 2 was greater in the with-obstacles condition for <b>the</b> <b>healthy</b> group, whereas it remained unchanged for the group with hemiplegia. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated that the addition of obstacles during gait increased the ECW and decreased mean walking speed in both <b>the</b> <b>healthy</b> subjects and <b>the</b> patients with hemiplegia. More interestingly, the authors found differences in adaptation strategies between <b>the</b> <b>healthy</b> subjects and <b>the</b> patients with hemiplegia. During the with-obstacles condition, the oxygen uptakes of <b>the</b> <b>healthy</b> subjects increased and mean walking speed decreased, whereas, in the subjects with hemiplegia, only mean walking speed decreased.
