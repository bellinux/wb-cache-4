5|$|In 1942, the Tower Building was renovated due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It {{became the}} new home of the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, which had been located in Little Rock City Hall. The museum {{remained}} in the tower building for approximately fifty-five years. The area surrounding the Tower Building had been known as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Bernie Babcock, however, the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{much to the}} nation's surprise, the Hanshin Tigers {{faced the}} Seibu Lions and took their first and only victory in the Japan Series, largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of star slugger Randy Bass (presently State Senator from Oklahoma), an American playing for the team.|$|E

5|$|Nuyts was {{released}} from captivity in 1636, most likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of François Caron, who knew Nuyts from serving as his interpreter during the unsuccessful Japanese embassy of 1627.

5|$|According to unverified reports it is {{believed}} that St. Thaddeus was buried {{at the site of the}} St. Thaddeus Monastery in the 1st century A.D., and that St. Gregory was responsible for establishing a monastery here in the 4th century. However, there is recorded proof that St. Thaddeus Monastery dates to the 7th century. It was the second Armenian church to be built, following the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and was the seat of the diocese in the 10th century. It was destroyed in an earthquake in 1319 and was rebuilt due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Bishop Zachariah in the 1320s.|$|E
5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} {{recovery}} {{was made possible}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of the Komnenian dynasty. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Komnenian restoration. The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1928 he was {{credited}} with developing several new camera angles. Cronjager was lauded by industry magazines such as Variety for his inventive camera work in 1928's Warming Up, which added realism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Dix as a baseball pitcher. In September 1928 Cronjager became involved in a minor controversy. The film industry was becoming unionized, and Cronjager was resistant to joining. When Dix insisted Cronjager photograph his next film, Moran of the Marines, the union threatened to strike if the cinematographer was hired without becoming a union member. Cronjager joined the union {{at the request of}} the studio, averting the threatened union action. Throughout his career, Dix attempted to have Cronjager as the cinematographer on his films.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1969, the {{pipeline}} crossed the Laotian frontier through the Mu Gia Pass and, by 1970, {{it reached the}} approaches to the A Shau Valley in South Vietnam. The plastic pipeline, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, managed to transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all through the same pipe. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of the PAVN 592nd Pipelaying Regiment, the number of pipelines entering Laos increased to six that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that is today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, largely thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Professor Sir John Cleland. Most of this land was combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up the gully to the summit of Mount Lofty and northwards to Greenhill Road. Waterfall Gully Reserve {{was added to the}} park in 1972.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, the Castillonnais {{was officially}} {{recognized}} by the French Ministry of Agriculture, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of {{a small number of}} breed enthusiasts, though by that time only 50 purebred mares remained. The breed association's name was changed to L’association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP) (National Association of Castillonnais Horses of the Ariège Pyrenees), and is headquartered in Castillon-en-Couserans. Le Conservatoire du Patrimoine Biologique Régional de Midi-Pyrénées (Conservatory of the Biological Heritage of the Midi-Pyrénées Region), an organization that has worked to protect the diversity of animal species in the region since 1980, is also committed to protecting the breed.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of the organization, {{heritage}} turkey populations have {{increased more than}} tenfold in little over a decade, and several breeds that once stood {{on the brink of}} extinction now maintain healthy populations. The organization also sustains programs that deal with preserving and promoting endangered cattle and pig breeds, as well as breed-specific programs relating to many of its livestock categories. Breeds that the Conservancy has assisted in saving include the Carolina Marsh Tacky horse, Randall cattle, Red Wattle hogs and the American rabbit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{political}} {{forces in the}} Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia. But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate George W. Joseph in the 1930 Republican primary, and later his law partner Julius Meier, were understood to demonstrate strong public support for public ownership of dams. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled {{the construction of the}} Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as public works projects. The legislation was attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Oregon Senator Charles McNary, Washington Senator Clarence Dill, and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin, among others.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, jazz began {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} rock music, and began using distortion and feedback, partially due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Jimi Hendrix, who had strong links with jazz.

Jazz musicians who have incorporated noise elements, feedback and distortion include Bill Frisell, David Krakauer Cecil Taylor, Gábor Szabó, Garnett Brown, Grachan Moncur III, Jackie McLean, John Abercrombie, John McLaughlin, Joseph Bowie, Larry Coryell, McCo Tyner, Ornette Coleman, Pat Metheny, Phil Minton, Roswell Rudd, and Scott Henderson.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{unbeknownst to}} Kurosawa, Rashomon had been {{entered in the}} prestigious Venice Film Festival, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Giuliana Stramigioli, a Japan-based {{representative}} of an Italian film company, who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, Rashomon was awarded the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion, shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, {{which at the time}} was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.|$|E
5|$|Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda {{had their}} bans {{cancelled}} early. Żmuda and Młynarczyk returned in the 1–0 home win over East Germany on 2 May 1981, and Boniek was reinstated four months later. The players' recall was partly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of Kulesza's replacement, Antoni Piechniczek, {{to secure their}} return. According to Majchrzak, Boniek and Żmuda apologised for their actions before the General Committee for Physical Culture and Sport of the Polish People's Republic, the PZPN's governing body, but kept this from Terlecki, who appealed to have his ban lifted several times, but to no avail.|$|E
