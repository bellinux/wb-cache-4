The poisoning was due to prolonged ingestion of rubber plant leaves sprayed with the insecticide in a rubber plantation adjacent to the sanctuary. Though no specific gross lesions were observed, histopathologically, centilobular hepatic necrosis, mild renal degeneration, necrotic enteritis, pulmonary congestion and neuronal degeneration were recorded in all three animals...|$|R
50|$|Gee's {{golden langur}} (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>geei),</b> or simply the golden langur, is an Old World monkey {{found in a}} small region of western Assam, India and in the {{neighboring}} foothills of the Black Mountains of Bhutan. It {{is one of the}} most endangered primate species of India. Long considered sacred by many Himalayan people, the golden langur was first brought to the attention of the western world by the naturalist E. P. Gee in the 1950s. In a part of Bhutan, it has hybridised with the capped langur T. pileatus.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} endemic or near-endemic mammals {{including}} Gee's golden langur (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>geei)</b> which is found {{north of the}} Brahmaputra River between the Sankosh and Manas Rivers. Other endemic mammals are Hodgson's giant flying squirrel (Petaurista magnificus), Namdapha flying squirrel (Biswamoyopterus biswasi) and Brahma white-bellied rat (Niviventer brahma), while endangered species found here include a population of Bengal tigers adapted to higher mountain slopes and having a high conservation priority. Other endangered species include takin (Budorcas taxicolor) and Himalayan serow (a subspecies of Capricornis sumatraensis) {{as well as the}} vulnerable Mandelli's mouse-eared bat (Myotis sicarius), Assam macaque (Macaca assamensis), stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides), dhole (Cuon alpinus), back-striped weasel (Mustela strigidorsa), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and Irrawaddy squirrel (Callosciurus pygerythrus). The area also includes patches of fir forest with a bamboo undergrowth that are home to the endangered red panda (Ailurus fulgens).|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to know the parasitic infestation in captive non human primates of Assam State Zoo. Materials and Methods: A total of twenty two faecal samples from non human primates of different species viz. Slow loris (Nycticebus coucang) (3), Pig tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) (3), Stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides) (5), Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) (1), Bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata) (1), Golden langur (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>geei)</b> (6) and Hoolock gibbon (Hylobates hoolock) (3) were analysed from August, 2009 to December, 2009 by using routine sedimentation and floatation techniques as described by Georgi (1985). Identification of parasitic ova was carried out as described by Soulsby (1982) and Wallach and Boever (1983). Results: Out of 22 faecal samples examined, 1 (20 %) in stump-tailed macaque was found positive for Oesophagostomum spp. and 1 (16. 67 %) in golden langur and 1 (33. 33 %) in hoolock gibbon, were found positive for the presence of Trichuris spp. Conclusion: Incidence of parasitic infection was 13. 63 % in captive non human primates of Assam State Zoo.

40|$|Gee's {{golden langur}} (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>geei)</b> is an {{endangered}} colobine primate, endemic to the semi-evergreen and mixed-deciduous forests of Indo-Bhutan border. During {{the last few}} decades, extensive fragmentation has caused severe population decline and local extinction of golden langur from several fragments. However, no studies {{are available on the}} impact of habitat fragmentation and the genetic diversity of golden langur in the fragmented habitats. The present study aimed to estimate the genetic diversity in the Indian population of golden langur. We sequenced and analyzed around 500 bases of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region-I from 59 fecal samples of wild langur collected from nine forest fragments. Overall, genetic diversity was high (h = 0. 934, Ï€ = 0. 0244) and comparable with other colobines. Populations in smaller fragments showed lower nucleotide diversity compared to the larger forest fragments. The median-joining network of haplotypes revealed a genetic structure that corresponded with the geographical distribution. The Aie and Champabati Rivers were found to be a barrier to gene flow between golden langur populations. In addition, it also established that T. geei is monophyletic but revealed possible hybridization with capped langur, T. pileatus, in the wild. It is hoped that these findings would result in a more scientific approach towards managing the fragmented populations of this enigmatic species...|$|R
40|$|The {{golden langur}} (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>geei)</b> is an {{endangered}} endemic species of primate in Bhutan. Conservation {{of this species}} is addressed here through phylogeographic and habitat management tools. I hypothesize that rivers and mountains in Bhutan isolated a population of capped langurs (Trachypithecus pileatus) and that this population later speciated into the morphologically distinct golden langur. Trachypithecus, the genus to which both capped and golden langurs belong, spread north from a paleo-refuge in south China and Semnopithecus (grey langurs) spread east and northward from a refuge in south India. My results show that these two genera both arrived in Bhutan but could not mix since the Sunkosh River and Pelela range form a biogeographic barrier. Likewise, a population of capped langurs isolated from parental populations by rivers speciated into the distinct golden langur. I conducted field surveys covering {{the entire range of}} langurs in Bhutan, confirming the distribution and isolating barriers among the three langurs. Grey langurs and golden langurs are isolated from each other by the Sunkosh River and Black Mountain range in west Bhutan. In the east, the Manas river system (Manas-Mangde-Chamkhar) served as a barrier between golden and capped langurs. However, this barrier has been broken in the last 30 years due to the construction of bridges over the Chamkhar river. A hybrid zone was found and the implications are discussed. A cyt b phylogeny showed the grey langur of Bhutan grouping into a distinct clade with other congenerics of Semnopithecus. The south-Indian clade of grey langurs is more ancient, with the Bhutan and Nepal grey langurs having diverged later. The golden and capped langur from Bhutan grouped with Trachypithecus from South East Asia. Finally, I explore conservation of golden langur habitat in Bhutan and estimate available habitat at 3, 089 km 2 and an estimated population of about 6, 000 individuals. I also find that the most viable strategy for conservation of langur habitat is to give ownership of the forests to local people, with monitoring by the Department of Forestry...|$|R
5000|$|Royal Manas National Park in {{southern}} Bhutan, considered the national heritage of Bhutan, was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1996 and subsequently {{raised to the}} status of a national park in 1993. Covering an area of 9938.54 km2, the area is forested to the extent of 92% and is a well-preserved Eastern Himalayan ecosystem. The park is bounded on its north by the Black Mountain National Park and the Manas Tiger Reserve on its South in India. Within Bhutan, biological corridors linked with the park are the Thrumshingla National Park in the North, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary in the West, and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary in the East. As researched so far, the park has a large diversity of tropical grasslands, temperate moist forests, alpine meadows, and scrublands. The various flora and fauna identified in the park are 45 species of mammals, 366 species of birds and 900 species of vascular plants. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is actively working on a conservation management plan in association with local wildlife authorities to preserve and protect this national heritage.Some of the important faunal species identified are: the royal Bengal tiger, elephant, gaur (Bos gaurus), four rare species of golden langur (<b>Trachypithecus</b> <b>geei),</b> pygmy hog (Sus salvanius), hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and wild Asiatic water buffalo (Bubalus arnee). There are 362 species of birds, out of which four species of hornbills (rufous-necked, wreathed, pied and great Indian) have been recorded. Apart from the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) other aquan species identified in the river are the deep bodied mahseer (Tor tor), golden mahseer (Tor putitora), and chocolate mahseer or katle (Acrossocheilus hexangonolepis). Five thousand people live within the park limits in several villages. Tigers, the most revered animal in Bhutan, are estimated to number about 100 and are mostly in this national park and the neighbouring Manas National Park in India ...|$|R
