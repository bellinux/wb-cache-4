5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome.|$|E
5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's {{record as}} CEO {{was subject to}} some dispute among Wall Street analysts. A 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries {{attracted}} the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency. Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit, Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period. In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> continue in litigation. Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton, which the company settled for $250 million.|$|E

5|$|Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh {{fell from}} power in 1232.

He put <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands, and was responsible {{for a series of}} riots against foreign clerics. Hubert took sanctuary in Merton College Chapel, but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Des Roches took over the King's government, backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England, who saw this as a chance to take back the lands which they had lost to Hubert's followers in the previous decades.|$|E
