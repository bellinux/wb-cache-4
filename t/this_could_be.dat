5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> achieved by writing an allocator that allocates extra memory {{in which it}} places debugging information.

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested that <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the native}} {{conditions}} of where it developed, the Boreray is very well suited to conservation grazing, which is grazing that uses livestock to improve biodiversity and achieve nature conservation in a given area.

5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Further rumours {{circulated}} {{about the}} death of Corder and Marten's child.

5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of the tender dumping water. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E

5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E

5|$|According to Meintjes, Kruger {{was still}} not {{particularly}} anti-British; he thought the British {{had made a mistake}} and would rectify the situation if <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids.
