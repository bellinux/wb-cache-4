40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2011. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 32). Integrated marketing communication (IMC) {{has emerged as a}} new concept in marketing in the twenty-first century. Its customer focus, intended to grow and retain customers, is more than just advertising and promotion, and it takes into consideration more than just customers or clients. This report examines how IMC is more than simply the integration of advertising and promotional activities in perspective of one of the leading cement brand of the country Premier Cement. This report firstly provides an overview of integrated marketing communications, its concept, current trends and how it is important to build a strong brand. Next, the report contains about the analysis of major tenets of Premier Cement brand communications, its functions, current strategy, how it related to the company’s brand equity and lastly a brief evaluations of the marketing communication programs of the company. Also provides a critical observations and recommendations according to my point of view on the basis of findings on integrated marketing communications of the company. Though Premier Cement started their journey in 2004 commercially but it initiated heavy investment in their marketing program from 2007. And from then the company able <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> <b>up</b> its growth as well as created strong market in the cement industry. Currently the company is running with an annual production capacity of 12 lacs metric tons producing 80, 000 tons of cement per month which is a significant achievement in such a short time. Moreover, the company has a plan to increase its production capacity to expand market share. In a very competitive and saturated cement market the company is able to increase its sales growth and can think of to increase their market share because of its marketing and brand communication programs. Though the market communications of the company is quite traditional but they are successful in integrating the market communication programs effectively. Premier cement offered two promotional campaign last year; CASH++ Offer and Eid 2 Eid offer. This proved to be a successful campaign for Premier Cement as they achieve 98 % of their sales target from this program. This year the company also re-launched the CASH++ offer and till August 2011, the offer is quite successful to achieve the sales target. And the company is planning to launch a new promotional campaign from this September 2011. The company always tries to integrate its communication mix, brand tools, IMC and brand equity strategy in a way so that it {{goes hand in hand with}} their marketing programs. Thus, all the promotional campaign of Premier Cement achieving its expectation because of proper integration and management of marketing communication programs. However, Premier Cement required lots of improvement and strategic development in their communication programs. As I mentioned, the IMC programs of the company are quite conventional and not sustainable in a long run. So the company needs to update and have to think out of the conventional way of market communications in order to sustain in a long run. At the same time the company should have to increase their investment on marketing programs since it called the life blood of any business to generate the ultimate sales, customer satisfaction and sustainable brand image.

40|$|In view of {{the rapid}} {{extension}} of offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to improve our knowledge on possible adverse effects of underwater sound generated by pile-driving. Mortality and injuries have been observed in fish exposed to loud impulse sounds, but knowledge on the sound levels at which (sub-) lethal effects occur is limited for juvenile and adult fish, and virtually non-existent for fish eggs and larvae. A device was developed in which fish larvae can be exposed to underwater sound. It consists of a rigid-walled cylindrical chamber driven by an electro-dynamical sound projector. Samples of up to 100 larvae can be exposed simultaneously to a homogeneously distributed sound pressure and particle velocity field. Recorded pile-driving sounds could be reproduced accurately in the frequency range between 50 and 1000 Hz, at zero <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> pressure levels <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 210 dB re 1 µPa 2 (zero <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> pressures <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 32 kPa) and single pulse sound exposure levels up to 186 dB re 1 µPa 2 s. The device {{was used to examine}} lethal effects of sound exposure in common sole (Solea solea) larvae. Different developmental stages were exposed to various levels and durations of pile-driving sound. The highest cumulative sound exposure level applied was 206 dB re 1 µPa 2 s, which corresponds to 100 strikes at a distance of 100 m from a typical North Sea pile-driving site. The results showed no statistically significant differences in mortality between exposure and control groups at sound exposure levels which were well above the US interim criteria for non-auditory tissue damage in fish. Although our findings cannot be extrapolated to fish larvae in general, as interspecific differences in vulnerability to sound exposure may occur, they do indicate that previous assumptions and criteria may need to be revise...|$|R
40|$|Microcantilever motion {{detection}} is {{a useful}} tool for the characterization of the physical, chemical and biological properties of materials. In the past, different approaches have been proposed and tested to enhance the behavior, size and simplicity of microcantilever motion detectors. In this paper, a new approach to measure microcantilever motion with nanometric resolution is presented. The proposed approach is based on the concept of mechanically-modulated optical feedback interferometry, a technique that has shown displacement measurement capabilities well within the nanometric scale and that, due to its size, compactness and low cost, may be a suitable choice for measuring nanometric motions in cantilever-like sensors. It will be shown that the sensor, in its current state of development, is capable of following a cantilever sinusoidal trajectory at different sets of frequencies ranging up to 200 Hz and <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> amplitudes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> ¿/ 2 with experimental resolutions in the ¿/ 100 range.

40|$|Simulations of the {{temperature}} and vacuum effects of Martian atmospheric entry upon Bacillus atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis var niger; 8058; NCIMB) endospores were carried out inside a purpose-built vacuum chamber. The work formed {{part of the study}} in support of planetary protection for the Beagle 2 Mars lander and investigated to what extent the outer surface of the lander's back heat shield would be sterilised during Mars atmospheric entry. The spores were heated <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> temperatures <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300 degrees C over 30 s under vacuum conditions (10 (- 3) mbar). There was no effect on spore viability until peak temperatures reached 180 - 200 degrees C (12 - 15 s of heat exposure). Spore viability then fell rapidly with increasing temperature. Once peak temperatures exceeded 300 degrees C, no further spore viability was detected. The average heating rate was rapid (10 degrees C s(- 1)); thus spores were exposed <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> temperatures for less than a second. These data inform on the process of determining bioburden reduction and control steps necessary for external surfaces of spacecraft which are non-sterile at launch, as well as providing new information about the ability of a model resistant organism to survive rapid, short-duration heating.

The mechanical forcing system consists of two counter rotating hexagonal cylinders located parallel to the span of the nozzle. Forcing frequencies up to 1, 500 Hz were tested. Both symmetric and antisymmetric forcing can be implemented. The results for antisymmetric forcing showed a significant (75 percent) increase of the jet growth rate at an exit Mach number of 0. 25 and a Strouhal number of 0. 019. At higher rotational speeds, the jet deflected laterally. A deflection angle of 39 deg with respect to the centerline was measured at the maximum rotational speed...|$|R

Red House Gill {{is a small}} peri-urban sub-catchment of the River Wear, Northern England, which over the past 50 years has undergone extensive urban growth. This research assesses the effects of urbanisation on sediment delivery from this catchment. A sediment budget approach is used to investigate spatial patterns of fine sediment delivery from three main sub-catchments (East, Middle and West streams). Processes were monitored over a six month period using direct stream flow gauging and spatial sampling (with a network of nine Time-Integrated Mass Samplers- TIMS) together with fixed point photography of sediment sources and terrestrial laser scanning. Historic patterns of soil movement were indirectly assessed by measuring the basal trunk angle of 340 trees across the wooded catchment and a detailed dendrochronologic analysis of eight trees.

40|$|International audienceOptimum {{amplification}} in surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) {{from individual}} nanoantennas is expected when the excitation is slightly blue-shifted {{with respect to}} the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), so that the LSPR peak falls in the middle between the laser and the Stokes Raman emission. Recent experiments have shown when moving the excitation from the visible to the near-infrared that this rule of thumb is no more valid. The excitation has to be red-shifted with respect <b>to</b> the LSPR <b>peak,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 80 nm, to obtain highest SERS. Such discrepancy is usually attributed to a near-field (NF) to far-field (FF) spectral shift. Here we critically discuss this hypothesis for the case of gold nanocylinders. By combining multiwavelength-excitation SERS experiments with numerical calculations, we show that the red-shift of the excitation energy does not originate from a spectral shift between the extinction (FF) and the near-field distribution (NF), which is found to be not larger than 10 nm. Rather, it can be accounted for by looking at the peculiar spectral dependence of the near-field intensity on the cylinders diameter, characterized by an initial increase, up to 180 nm diameter, followed by a decrease and a pronounced skewness...|$|R

40|$|We aim {{to study}} the optical and {{near-infrared}} linear polarimetric properties of a sample of young M 7 -L 7 dwarfs (≈ 1 - 500 Myr) with spectroscopic signatures of low- and intermediate-gravity atmospheres. We collected optical (RIZ) and near-infrared (YJHK_ s) linear polarimetry images on various time scales from ∼ 0. 2 h to months. Linear polarization degrees in the interval 0 - 1. 5 % (I- and J-bands) were measured with accuracies ranging from ± 0. 1 % to ± 0. 9 % depending on the observing filter and the target brightness. We found that the young field dwarfs in our sample show similar polarimetric degrees at both I- and J-bands, {{and that there is}} no obvious trend with the spectral type. The two Taurus sources in our sample show intense levels of J-band linear polarization probably due to surrounding disks. By compiling data from the literature for high-gravity M 7 -L 7 dwarfs with likely ages > 500 Myr, we did not observe any apparent difference in the linear polarimetry intensity between the young and old samples that could be ascribed to differing atmospheric gravities.

40|$|Atmospheric {{turbulence}} causes {{fluctuations in}} the local refractive index of air that accumulatively disturb a wave's phase and amplitude distribution as it propagates. This impairs the effective range of laser weapons {{as well as the}} performance of free space optical (FSO) communication systems. Adaptive optics (AO) can be applied to effectively correct wavefront distortions in weak turbulence situations. However, in strong or deep turbulence, where scintillation and beam breakup are common phenomena, traditional wavefront sensing techniques {{such as the use of}} Shack-Hartmann sensors lead to incorrect results. Consequently, the performance of AO systems will be greatly compromised. We propose a new approach that can determine the major phase distortions in a beam instantaneously and guide an AO device to compensate for the phase distortion in a few iterations. In our approach, we use a plenoptic wavefront sensor to image the distorted beam into its 4 D phase space. A fast reconstruction algorithm based on graph theory is applied to recognize the phase distortion of a laser beam and command the AO device to perform phase compensation. As a result, we show in our experiments that an arbitrary phase distortion with <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> value <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 22 π can be corrected within a few iteration steps. Scintillation and branch point problems are smartly avoided by the plenoptic sensor and its fast reconstruction algorithm. In this article, we will demonstrate the function of the plenoptic sensor, the fast reconstruction algorithm as well as the beam correction improvements when our approach is applied to an AO system.
