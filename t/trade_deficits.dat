The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E

As the value of the dollar declines (or RMB appreciates), ceteris paribus, so does the <b>trade</b> <b>deficit.</b> Hence, there is a need for China to adjust its exchange rate policy to help reduce the ever mounting US <b>trade</b> <b>deficit.</b> Copyright � 2008 The Author.

While economic growth and other fundamentals improved steadily during Mečiar's term, public and private debt and <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> also rose, and privatization was uneven.

Imports are an economic benefit to the importing nation because they provide the nation with real goods it can consume, that it otherwise would not have had.

Currency transferred to foreign ownership, however represents a future claim over goods of that nation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the linkage between}} budget <b>deficit</b> and <b>trade</b> <b>deficit</b> for Lebanon {{during the period from}} 1975 to 2003. The purpose is to test the validity of the Keynesian proposition and the Ricardian equivalence in the case of Lebanon. A robust econometric framework called the unrestricted error correction model (UECM) and a cointegration test called the bounds test are used to examine whether budget <b>deficit</b> and <b>trade</b> <b>deficit</b> are cointegrated. The Granger causality test shows that causality runs from <b>trade</b> <b>deficit</b> to budget deficit and the relationship is positive and statistically significant. The empirical analysis in this paper partially supports the Keynesian view that there is a linkage between <b>trade</b> <b>deficit</b> and budget deficit but the direction of causality is reversed which is consistent with many other empirical studies. The result suggests that any policy measures to reduce the <b>trade</b> <b>deficit</b> in Lebanon could well assist in reducing the Lebanese budget deficit. JEL classification: E 6...|$|R

25|$|Frondizi {{encouraged}} {{foreign investment}} in the sectors that had created chronic <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> between 1949 and 1962. 90% of all foreign investment during his term went into oil exploration, oil refineries, the auto industry, steel, and household durables. Ten of the 25 largest projects were for exploration of new oil fields. The record public investment in the petrochemical sector led to a fivefold increase in synthetic rubber production; by 1962, the production of crude oil tripled to 16 million cubic meters. Achieving self-sufficiency in oil freed {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in annual import costs for Argentina.

Perón also signed an important exploration contract with Standard Oil of California, in May 1955, consolidating his new policy of substituting the two largest sources of that era's chronic <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> (imported petroleum and motor vehicles) with local production brought in through foreign investment. The centrist Radical Civic Union's 1951 Vice-Presidential nominee, Arturo Frondizi, publicly condemned what he considered to be an anti-patriotic decision; as president three years later, however, he himself signed exploration contracts with foreign oil companies.|$|E

25|$|Though debt {{almost always}} {{increased}} under every {{president in the}} latter half of the 20th century, it declined as a percentage of GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior to Reagan.

Vice President George H. W. Bush was elected to succeed Reagan in 1988. The early Bush Presidency's economic policies were sometimes seen as a continuation of Reagan's policies, but in the early 1990s, Bush went back on a promise and increased taxes in a compromise with Congressional Democrats. He ended his presidency on a moderate note, signing regulatory bills such as the Americans With Disabilities Act, and negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1992, Bush and third-party candidate Ross Perot lost to Democrat Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|China {{has adopted}} a variety of {{measures}} to promote its foreign economic relations, maximizing the role of imports, exports, and foreign capital in economic development. Foreign trade organizations were reorganized, and control of imports and exports was relaxed or strengthened depending on the balance of trade {{and the level of}} foreign exchange reserves. Heavy purchases of foreign plants and equipment resulted in import restraint from 1980 to 1983. Because of the expansion of exports in the mid-1980s, a large foreign reserve surplus, and the decentralized management of foreign trade, imports surged. Huge, uncontrolled purchases of consumer goods led to <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> in 1984 and 1985, resulting in the introduction of an import and export licensing system, stricter controls on foreign exchange expenditures, and the devaluation of the yuan {{in order to reduce the}} trade deficit and ensure that machinery, equipment, and semi-finished goods, rather than consumer goods, were imported. In 1985 China had foreign exchange reserves of US$11.9 billion.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the Great Divergence is in dispute among historians. The {{traditional}} dating is {{as early as the}} 16th century, with scholars arguing that Europe had been on a trajectory of higher growth since that date. Pomeranz and others argue that the period of most rapid divergence was during the 19th century. Citing nutrition data and chronic European <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> as evidence, these scholars argue that before that date Asia was wealthier and more advanced, especially China in the Yangzi Delta and India in the Bengal and Mysore regions, as well as Egypt. Others, while accepting parity of incomes between the most prosperous parts of China, India, Egypt and Europe in the late 18th century, trace the first significant changes in European economies back to the 17th century. Others argue that the cultural factors behind the divergence can be traced to earlier periods and institutions such as the Renaissance and the Chinese imperial examination system.|$|E
