5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|HP {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer cost-effective {{for individual}} enterprise systems {{companies such as}} itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would {{be used by the}} majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and Intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer regarded adequate {{for a child}} to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{apparent}} differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees, a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic, provided that a few modifications were undertaken. These included the removal of two tribes of Melanthiaceae (Melanthiales) and the inclusion of three additional families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae and Velloziaceae) from other superorders. This newly and more narrowly redefined Lilianae/Liliiflorae contained three orders, Aparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales (which now included the stemonoids). This analysis also allowed {{for the establishment of}} a single synapomorphy, although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary. Significantly, the authors noted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> wonder the authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae.|$|E

5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer feasible {{to work within the}} parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still {{thought it was a}} quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} realignments {{occurred at}} the north end of the Green Line, but with less acrimony. North of Fort Totten, the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and proceeded to a point just west of Prince George's Plaza, with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro would have run through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park; the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the Beltway in 1974 meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro (as well as a Metro station and its parking lot). WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named West Hyattsville. The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington, and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how to go through this soft-soil burial ground (it was skirted using the New Austrian Tunnelling method), and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from Georgia Avenue – Petworth to Columbia Heights (the tunnels were stacked).|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, {{the tribe}} {{resisted}} repeated state efforts to declare <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer an Indian tribe because its members were multiracial in ancestry.

25|$|Until 1963, the High Court {{regarded}} {{decisions of}} the House of Lords binding, and there was substantial uniformity between Australian and English common law.

25|$|Most resumed the {{publication}} of the Freiheit in New York. He was imprisoned in 1886, again in 1887, and in 1902, the last time for two months for publishing after the assassination of President McKinley an editorial in which he argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> crime to kill a ruler.|$|E

Denton Colliery had flooded to the extent <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer workable and the Denton Colliery Co. went into voluntary liquidation in 1929. The headstock was demolished in 1932 and the shaft was finally filled and capped in 1974.|$|E
25|$|In Cannon v. United States (1885), the Court {{rejected}} two further challenges. First, the Court {{held that}} an indictment for the polygamy offense (which only applied to male defendants) need not allege {{the gender of}} the defendant. Second, the Court held <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> defense that the defendant had ceased having sexual relations with his additional wives.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with that}} game in Nashville, the format was changed so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer a {{singular}} all-star game per se; instead, four all-star teams, each representing {{one of the}} league's four divisions, participate in a two-round knockout tournament, with each game being two 10-minute halves in length and played with three skaters on each team. That format {{was used in the}} subsequent All-Star Games.|$|E
25|$|From 104 BC onwards, each legion used an aquila (eagle) as its {{standard}} symbol. The symbol {{was carried}} by an officer known as aquilifer, and its loss {{was considered to}} be a very serious embarrassment, and often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally, this was because any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer effective in combat.|$|E
