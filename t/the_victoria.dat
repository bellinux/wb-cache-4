5|$|Five of the {{separate}} VCs {{have so far}} been awarded. Willie Apiata received <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross for New Zealand on 2 July 2007, for his actions in the War in Afghanistan in 2004. <b>The</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross for Australia has been awarded four times.

A Canadian version has been cast that was originally to be awarded to the Unknown Soldier at the rededication of the Vimy Memorial on 7 April 2007.

5|$|In 1950, when India {{became a}} republic, Gurkhas {{serving in the}} Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army lost their {{eligibility}} for <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross and they are now covered under the separate Indian honours system. Under this system the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), which is India's highest military decoration for valour, {{is considered to be}} equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross. As such only those serving in the Gurkha units of the British Army remain eligible for <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{troops were}} not {{originally}} eligible for <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross {{since they had}} been eligible for the Indian Order of Merit since 1837 which was the oldest British gallantry award for general issue. When <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross was created, Indian troops were still controlled by the Honourable East India Company and did not come under Crown control until 1860. European officers and men serving with the Honourable East India Company were not eligible for the Indian Order of Merit and <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross was extended to cover them in October 1857. It was {{only at the end}} of the 19th century that calls for Indian troops to be awarded <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross intensified. Indian troops became eligible for the award in 1911. The first awards to Indian troops appeared in the London Gazette on 7 December 1914 to Darwan Sing Negi and Khudadad Khan. Negi was presented with <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross by King George V during a visit to troops in France. The presentation occurred on 5 December 1914 and he is one of a very few soldiers presented with his award before it appeared in the London Gazette.|$|E

In February 1899, <b>the</b> <b>Victorias</b> would lose a two-game total goals series 5-3 against Montreal. In their next chance, <b>the</b> <b>Victorias</b> {{defeated}} Montreal Shamrocks in a two-game, total goals series 4-3, 2-1 (6-4) on January 29 and 31, 1901 in Montreal. <b>The</b> <b>Victorias</b> held <b>the</b> trophy, winning the Manitoba championship, and successfully defended the Stanley Cup against Toronto in two-game, total goals series 5-3, 5-3 (10-6) on January 21 and 23, 1902 in Winnipeg at <b>the</b> Auditorium. <b>The</b> <b>Victorias</b> run as champion ended in a loss to Montreal Hockey Club in a best two-of-three 1-0, 0-5 and 1-2 on March 13, 15 and 17, 1902 in Winnipeg.|$|R

50|$|In {{their third}} game against <b>the</b> <b>Victorias</b> at Westmount's arena, the Ottawa team arrived 1½ hours late {{due to a}} loss of their baggage. The game was called at midnight due to a curfew, with Ottawa ahead 4-1, with 16 minutes left to play. Ottawa and <b>the</b> <b>Victorias</b> had {{disagreed}} on substitution for injured players instead of 'recuperation time' and <b>the</b> <b>Victorias</b> used 43 minutes of injury time, which the Ottawa club complained was a stalling tactic to get the game canceled as Ottawa was ahead.|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} 1,358 Victoria Crosses have been awarded since 1856 to 1,355 men. There are several {{statistics}} {{related to the}} greatest number of VCs awarded in individual battles or wars. The greatest number of Victoria Crosses won on a single day is 24, for deeds performed on 16 November 1857 in Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny. The greatest number won by a single unit during a single action is seven, to the 2nd/24th Foot, for the defence of Rorke's Drift, 22–23 January 1879, during the Zulu War. The greatest number won in a single conflict is 628, being for the First World War. There are only six living holders of the VC—four British, one Australian, one Gurkha—one award for the Second World War and four awards since; in addition one New Zealander holds <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross for New Zealand and four Australians hold <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> Cross for Australia.
