25|$|All {{of these}} sources tell of {{the siege of}} the city from the {{perspective}} of the besiegers. No accounts of the events as seen from inside the city have survived to modern times. There is a total absence of Muslim sources, perhaps because of the absence of good writers in the city or perhaps due to a desire not <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loss of such an important city. Translations of some of the few Arabic texts that refer indirectly to the loss of the city are all that is available to cover this aspect of the history of the siege.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{has been}} outspoken {{in his defense}} of [...] "Jihad", and has claimed that the song has the [...] "coolest angle" [...] on Christ Illusion. [...] "These new songs aren't {{political}} at all," [...] King states, [...] "'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' — it's what's spewing out at us from the TV." [...] He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorists' perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, although he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so. They did not wish <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic [...] "because every band on the planet already has" [...] and [...] "came from a certain perspective", so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint. [...] "We're Slayer, {{we have to be}} different" [...] was King's assertion.|$|E

I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just knew I {{had a really good}} part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{personal}} {{mythology of}} Luceafărul is overall a poetic rendition {{of a personal}} philosophy of love. Caracostea proposes that Eminescu had special reason <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poem, which must therefore express [...] "a fundamental experience". This {{is not the case}} for other ideas he borrowed from Kunisch, which merely resulted in conventional pieces such as [...] "Miron and The Disembodied Beauty". The [...] "allegorical meaning" [...] is explained by Eminescu's own comment: [...] " [...] is immortal, but lacks good fortune." [...] The result, according to scholar Geo Vasile, is Eminescu's [...] "triumph in the world of ideas": [...] "Here, the Albatross-poet extends his wings in all their magnificent reach." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{weeks of}} secrecy, Denham finally tells Englehorn and Driscoll that their {{destination}} is Skull Island, an uncharted land shown {{on a map}} in Denham's possession. Denham also cryptically alludes to some monstrous creature rumored <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, a legendary entity known only as [...] "Kong". When they find the island and anchor offshore, they see a native village, separated {{from the rest of}} the island by an enormous ancient stone wall. A landing party, including the filming crew and Ann, witnesses a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young maiden as the [...] "bride of Kong". The intruders are spotted and the native chief (Noble Johnson) angrily stops the ceremony. When he sees the blonde Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the [...] "golden woman". They rebuff him and return to the Venture.|$|E
2500|$|Wagon Master {{has been}} called a [...] "film poem" [...] or its {{equivalent}} by several critics and scholars, which connotes that the film's storyline is less important than its visual portrait of the community of the wagon train. Scott Eyman and Paul Duncan wrote in 2004 that Wagon Master [...] "is a lyrical ballad, an affirmation of Ford's folk vision of America, where a dance or a graveside ceremony speaks more for the communally minded pioneers than all the dramatic battles in the world." [...] Jeremy Arnold wrote, [...] Lindsay Anderson wrote in 1954 that, [...] "Ford often abandons his narrative completely, <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wide and airy vistas, on riders and wagons overcoming the most formidable natural obstacles, on bowed and weary figures stumbling persistently through the dust." [...] And Richard Jameson, in 2003: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{psychology}} {{there is}} a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend <b>to</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> negative more than the positive. Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one’s ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that “negative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively enhance memory for material that follows them,” (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992, p.25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will they better remember information they received just after viewing the negative material? ...|$|E
