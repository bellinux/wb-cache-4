Foley countered, [...] "The evidence has been supported by people who know far more about the science of painting than David Starkey.

Mercedes discovers Lynsey's relationship with Riley, which Metcalfe explained comes as a shock to Mercedes who has developed a close friendship with Lynsey so does not react as expected. Hassan said that her character's love rivals, Mercedes and Mitzeee, [...] "won't be looking after Lynsey's best interests, so she's going to have to fight for Riley's love.

She added that Lynsey values her friendship with Mercedes and would not want to lose it while Mitzeee is a different kind of threat. Hassan went on to say that the storyline will become [...] "deeper and darker" [...] and is not going to end happily, as even though Lynsey and Riley make a good couple Lynsey has never been lucky with men.|$|E

2500|$|The {{massacre}} [...] "spawned a [...] mass of polemical literature, bubbling with theories, {{prejudices and}} phobias" [...] Many Catholic authors were exultant in their {{praise of the}} king for his bold and decisive action (after regretfully abandoning a policy of meeting Huguenot demands {{as far as he}} could) against the supposed Huguenot coup, whose details were now fleshed out in officially sponsored works, though the larger mob massacres were somewhat deprecated: [...] " [...] must excuse the people's fury moved by a laudable zeal which is difficult to restrain once it has been stirred up". Huguenot works understandably dwelt on the harrowing details of violence, expounded various conspiracy theories that the royal court had long planned the massacres, and often showed extravagant anti-Italian feelings directed at Catherine, Gondi, and other Italians at court. Diplomatic correspondence was readier than published polemics to recognise the unplanned and chaotic nature of the events, which also emerged from several accounts in memoirs published over the following years by witnesses to the events at court, including two dramatic and influential accounts by {{members of the royal family}} that were not recognised as fake until the 19th century, those supposedly by Marguerite of Navarre, and Anjou. Anjou's supposed account was the source of the quotation attributed to Charles IX: [...] "Well <b>then,</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> it! Kill them! But kill them all!

2500|$|... "Part II (On the Run)" [...] is {{a smooth}} slow-tempo electro-R love ballad which is {{equipped}} with a steamy, retro and retro-futuristic groove that creates an acute level of moody texture. It is instrumentally complete with keyboards and drums. Jon Pareles, a writer of The New York Times noted that it was the closest song to pop music on Magna Carta Holy Grail. Pareles further noted that Timbaland's production sets aside his usual brittle tones to hint at the keyboard confections of 1980's Lionel Richie and Don Henley. Lyrically, the song speaks about a rebellious couple that is desperately in love. The song opens with an airy prelude during which Beyoncé sings the lines, [...] "Who wants that perfect love story anyway anyway / Cliché cliché cliché. Who wants that hero love that saves the day anyway, cliché cliché cliché" [...] in dreamy lead vocals along with breathy harmonies. Jay-Z and Beyoncé further trade verses about fugitives finding romance, with Beyoncé singing, [...] "I hear sirens while we make love" [...] and slowly exhaling in the song, singing in her lower register, swearing that she can still hold her lover's heart and gun. She further denounces the couple's own love story as [...] "a toast to clichés in a dark past" [...] over dizzy, diving synths and drums which sound like [...] "they came out of Eric B's basement," [...] as stated by Grant Jones of the website Rap Reviews. With the lines: [...] "If it's you and me against the world/ <b>Then</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> it," [...] Jay-Z notes the criticism towards the couple when they first went public with [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and the lines referencing Tupac Shakur in the song. He further acknowledges that if anyone attacks his girlfriend he would kill them: [...] "Cross the line, speak about mine/ I'mma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine/ Touch a ni--a where his rib at/ I click clat/ Push your muh'fuckin' wig back." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the point}} of view of today's {{mainstream}} schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates money supply and/or aggregate demand on a stable growth path. When threatened by the forecast of a depression central banks should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing. At the beginning of the Great Depression most economists believed in Say's law and the self-equilibrating powers of the market and failed to explain the severity of the Depression. Outright leave-it-alone liquidationism was a position mainly held by the Austrian School. The liquidationist position was that a depression is good medicine. The idea was the benefit of a depression was to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses so that these could be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy. They argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy took mass bankruptcies, <b>then</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> it. An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences. Regarding the policies of President Hoover, economists like Barry Eichengreen and J. Bradford DeLong point out that President Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him. Despite liquidationist expectations, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre-1924 levels by 1933. Milton Friedman called the leave-it-alone liquidationism [...] "dangerous nonsense". He wrote: ...|$|E
