500|$|He has {{admitted}} that he is his [...] "mother's boy", which Ono has cited as the reason why she {{was never able to}} get close to him: [...] "Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind." [...] Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.|$|E
500|$|Lamb of God's Chris Adler said: [...] "If {{anybody who}} plays heavy metal {{says that they}} weren't {{influenced}} by Black Sabbath's music, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did." [...] Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: [...] "They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath {{are in the same}} league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary." [...] On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: [...] "The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come." [...] Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that [...] "Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre".|$|E
2500|$|Foreign {{minister}} said [...] "this is a disproportionate {{response to what}} has happened and if both sides are going to drive each other into a tight corner <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all this will develop in a very dramatic and tragic way." [...] He added: [...] "We firmly reaffirm support for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Geneticist Bryan Sykes and {{his team}} at Oxford University report that DNA {{analysis}} of presumed Yeti (or [...] "Abominable Snowman") samples {{may have come from}} a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. According to Sykes, [...] "I think this bear, which nobody has seen alive, may still be there and may have quite a lot of polar bear in it. It may be some sort of hybrid and if its behaviour is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> may well be the source of the mystery and the source of the legend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reactions to {{the global}} {{surveillance}} disclosures {{among members of the}} U.S. Congress initially were largely negative. Speaker of the House John Boehner and senators Dianne Feinstein and Bill Nelson called Snowden a traitor, and several senators and representatives joined them in calling for Snowden's arrest and prosecution. Arizona Senator John McCain criticized politicians who voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act but were outraged by the NSA spying on phone calls by saying, [...] "We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation. Now, if members of Congress did not know what they were voting on, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that's their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will tell me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "If an {{immigrant}} {{has been here}} {{for a long time and}} there is no realistic prospect of returning them, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> person's condition should be regularised so that they can pay taxes and join the rest of society," [...] Boris Johnson told the 2,500-strong assembly.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the lead single, [...] "Russian Roulette", Harmony was aware of the mixed {{reaction}} from fans who had heard the track. He assured fans that the song was not fully representative {{to the rest of the}} album, though it reflected Rihanna's growth as an artist. In an interview with Rap-Up, Tricky Stewart announced that he had collaborated with The-Dream on the project. He described the album as a whole as [...] "uptempo and edgy", stating that the album is different from her past works. In February 2010, Rihanna expressed a positive opinion on the album, but commented that her future work would be less intense. She asserted, [...] "I really like the bottom, the grime of it. But if I were to combine that with more energetic, up-tempo pop records, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a happy marriage. And that's where we'll probably go next". When asked what the most important song to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] were cited as her favorites.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh! let me see. I said I hadn't {{been at the}} Royal Society soiree {{for four}} years, and got him {{to tell me about}} some of the fresh Mendelian work. He loves the Mendelians because he hates all the big names of the eighties and nineties. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> remarked <b>that</b> science was disgracefully under-endowed, and confessed I'd had to take to more {{profitable}} courses. 'The fact of it is,' I said, 'I'm the new playwright, Thomas More. Perhaps you've heard--?' Well, you know, he had." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't suppose I'd {{ever have}} found the lode if you hadn't {{encouraged}} me. I felt daunted once or twice. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> ventured to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you'd be interested." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "In Scotland it is {{altogether}} different.

6000|$|... "By the way," [...] he said, suddenly, [...] "there {{was a story}} {{went through}} Flanders near four years back of the best swordsman in the German army being killed by a mere boy in an English regiment, and I said <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this must be my pupil.

2500|$|When {{questioned}} on Midweek Politics {{about whether}} reporting on celebrities' sexual orientation incites homophobia {{by making it}} news, Hilton indicated {{that he did not}} believe so. He said that coming out in Hollywood is not necessarily a bad thing, citing Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell as examples: [...] "I know there is some controversy about outing people, but I also believe the only way we're gonna have change is with visibility. And if I have to drag some people screaming out of the closet, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> lots of celebrities have an archaic fear that being gay will hurt their career but look at Rosie. Look at Ellen." ...|$|R
2500|$|Artist Neville Page, in {{response}} to claims that {{the design of the}} creature was {{similar to that of the}} 2006 South Korean film The Host, said, [...] "They are [...] in that they ravage and seem to originate from the water, but the end results are quite different. However, when I finally saw some of the concept art, there were some very obvious similarities. But <b>then</b> again, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we were both channeling similar biological possibilities." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I believe," [...] he {{answered}} stubbornly, {{and there was}} silence between us, for here arguments did not avail. Also even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> could not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all our toils and sufferings would be in vain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Mrs Ford's {{influence}} {{is the worst}} possible for Ogden. I am sorry for her, {{but that does not}} alter my opinion. It is entirely owing to Mrs Ford that Ogden is what he is. She spoiled him, indulged him in every way, never checked him--till he has become--well, what you yourself called him, repulsive.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{he has stolen}} her from her father without payment; else he would not wish to hide her away in the secret krantz.

6000|$|... "Ah, I {{thought that}} there was a story from your face; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I can guess what it is about.

[...] "Now, my dear, I am ready to give you my best attention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{told me that}} they'd had a queer {{lot about}} the house, and that {{three or four of}} them left just <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> heard <b>that</b> two or three men from the place went to New Zealand together.

6000|$|... "That will do, <b>then,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have {{a little}} {{exhausted}} myself." [...] Then he turned round upon his couch, as though he intended to slumber. Mr. Grey left the room, and Augustus followed him, but not a word was spoken between them. Mr. Grey had an early dinner {{and went up to}} London by an evening train. What became of Augustus he did not inquire, but simply asked for his dinner and for a conveyance to the train. These were forthcoming, and he returned that night to Fulham.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Maggie, {{with simple}} seriousness, walking {{on as if}} she meant Philip to {{accompany}} her, [...] "I'm very glad you came, for I wished very much {{to have an opportunity}} of speaking to you. I've never forgotten how good you were long ago to Tom, and me too; but I was not sure that you would remember us so well. Tom and I have {{had a great deal of}} trouble since <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> makes one <b>think</b> more of what happened before the trouble came." ...|$|R
