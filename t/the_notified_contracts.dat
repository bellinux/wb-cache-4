5000|$|If no date is stipulated, {{performance}} {{must occur}} [...] "within a reasonable time," [...] to be determined, again, {{by the nature}} of the contract. Concrete Products v Natal Leather Industries is the leading and most illustrative case on the determination of reasonable time. In that case, the plaintiff agreed to sell the defendant a large number of steel corners for suitcases in different sizes. The agreement provided that several thousand of each size were to be delivered every week, and that the order for small corners was to be regarded as urgent. No time for the commencement of delivery was fixed. The plaintiff failed to deliver the small corners despite the defendant's insistence that the contract be carried out. He did, however, dispatch medium corners, which were accepted by the defendant in terms of the contract. As a result of the non-delivery of the small corners, the defendant, about three weeks after the date of <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> <b>notified</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff of its cancellation.|$|R
40|$|Under Task 24, the RAE Team {{provided}} Quality Assurance {{support to}} the Special Recovery Line (SRL) and the Advanced Recovery and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) projects of NMT- 6. Support was provided through ESH- 14. Monthly reports of work performed under this task were provided to NMT- 6 and ESH- 14. Copies of these reports are in RAE's project files. The procedures and assessment reports required by the task are on file only at NMT- 6 because of the sensitive nature of the information. In March 1999, our subcontractor, General Physics, informed us that the two individuals working on the task were resigning effective April 2, 1999. RAE notified Gary Cort, ESH- 14 technical representative for the task, and offered to replace the two individuals {{so that we could}} complete our obligations under the task (e-mail attached). No reply was ever received from Mr. Cert. We then reiterated our concern and offer of replacement with Mr. Cort's deputy, Spencer Hill (e-mail attached). No reply was received from Mr. Hill either. We subsequently learned the two General Physics employees were hired by another contractor and that the remaining work under the task was given to that contractor. We assumed our obligations under the task were completed at that point and <b>notified</b> <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> officer to that effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of over 800 1. 3 -GHz superconducting (SC) cavities for the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EXFEL), {{the largest in}} the history of cavity fabrication, has now been successfully completed. In the past, manufacturing of SC resonators was only partly industrialized; the main challenge for the EXFEL production was transferring the high-performance surface treatment to industry. The production was shared by the two companies RI Research Instruments GmbH (RI) and Ettore Zanon S. p. A. (EZ) on the principle of “build to print”. DESY provided the high-purity niobium and NbTi for the resonators. Conformity with the European Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) was developed together with <b>the</b> <b>contracted</b> <b>notified</b> body TUEV NORD. New or upgraded infrastructure has been established at both companies. Series production and delivery of fully-equipped cavities ready for cold rf testing was started in December 2012, and finished in December 2015. More than half the cavities delivered to DESY as specified (referred to “as received”) fulfilled the EXFEL specification. Further improvement of low-performing cavities was achieved by supplementary surface treatment at DESY or at the companies. The final achieved average gradient exceeded the EXFEL specification by approximately 25 %. In the following paper, experience with the 1. 3 -GHz cavity production for EXFEL is reported and the main lessons learned are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Weather Notification System is {{web site}} systems which use the GSM modem send SMS (Short Message Service) to {{customer}}/client for <b>notify</b> <b>the</b> weather information.
