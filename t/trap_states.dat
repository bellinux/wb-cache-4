5000|$|Core-shell {{semiconducting}} nanocrystals (CSSNCs) are a {{class of}} materials which have properties intermediate between those of small, individual molecules and those of bulk, crystalline semiconductors. They are unique because of their easily modular properties, which {{are a result of}} their size. These nanocrystals are composed of a quantum dot semiconducting core material and a shell of a distinct semiconducting material. The core and the shell are typically composed of type II-VI, IV-VI, and III-V semiconductors, with configurations such as CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS, CdSe/CdS, and InAs/CdSe (typical notation is: core/shell) Organically passivated quantum dots have low fluorescence quantum yield due to surface related <b>trap</b> <b>states.</b> CSSNCs address this problem because the shell increases quantum yield by passivating the surface <b>trap</b> <b>states.</b> [...] In addition, the shell provides protection against environmental changes, photo-oxidative degradation, and provides another route for modularity. Precise control of the size, shape, and composition of both the core and the shell enable the emission wavelength to be tuned over a wider range of wavelengths than with either individual semiconductor.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{signals of}} <b>trapping</b> <b>states</b> in the micromaser system {{in terms of}} the average number of cavity photons as well as a suitably defined correlation length of atoms leaving the cavity. In the description of collective two-atom effects we allow the mean number of pump atoms inside the cavity during the characteristic atomic cavity transit time to be as large as of order one. The master equation we consider, which describes the micromaser including collective two-atom effects, still exhibits <b>trapping</b> <b>states</b> for even for a mean number of atoms inside the cavity close to one.

50|$|The main {{challenge}} in using organic ligands for quantum dot surface trap passivation is {{the difficulty in}} simultaneously passivating both anionic and cationic surface traps. Steric hindrance between bulky organic ligands results in incomplete surface coverage and unpassivated dangling orbitals. Growing epitaxial inorganic semiconductor shells over quantum dots inhibits photo-oxidation and enables passivation of both anionic and cationic surface <b>trap</b> <b>states.</b> As photogenerated charge carriers {{are less likely to}} be trapped, the probability for excitons to decay through the radiative pathway increases. CdSe/CdS and ZnSe/CdSe nanocrystals have been synthesized that exhibit 85% and 80-90% quantum yield, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Another peak usually {{appears in}} the PL spectra of TMDC monolayers, which is {{associated}} to different quasi-particles called trions. These are excitons bound to another free carrier which can be either an electron or a hole. As a consequence a trion is a negative or positively charged complex. The presence of a strong trion peak in a PL spectrum, eventually stronger than the peak associated with exciton recombination, is a signature of a doped monolayer. It is believed now that this doping is extrinsic, which means that it arises from charged <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> present in the substrate (generally SiO2). Positioning a TMDC monolayer between two flakes of hBN removes this extrinsic doping and greatly increase the optical quality of the sample.|$|E
40|$|Nanotubes (NTs) of Ta 3 N 5 were {{synthesized}} by nitridation of Ta 2 O 5 NTs.

30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} bipolar resistance switching with eightwise polarity originates from {{the presence of the}} Schottky barrier near the Au/STO interface, in which there exist <b>trapping</b> <b>states,</b> such as oxygen vacancies and impurity states. The Schottky barrier width/height is changed due to the trapping/detrapping effect in the depletion layer [10, 14]. When a large forward-bias voltage is applied to the Schottky junction, electrons are discharged from the <b>trapping</b> <b>states,</b> resulting in unoccupied <b>trapping</b> <b>states</b> in the Schottky barrier. The increased density of positively charged <b>trapping</b> <b>states</b> in the depletion layer reduces the Schottky width/height, which results in the large leakage current simultaneously. So the Au/STO/Ti cell is switched to the LRS. In the lower-bias-voltage region, electrons can tunnel easily through the reduced Schottky barrier. When a large reverse-bias voltage is applied, electrons are captured in the <b>trapping</b> <b>states,</b> resulting in the reduction of the net positive charge in the depletion layer. This makes the barrier wider and higher, and the cell returns to the HRS. The trapped electrons seem to be released during a coming positive bias sweeping. The electroforming process is not required to realize this eightwise-polarity switching. This is because the high concentration of defects exists in the pristine junction due to the STO films prepared in an anoxic environment.|$|R
40|$|Nonradiative {{resonant}} {{energy transfer}} from CdSeS quantum dot to gold nanofilm was investigated by taking nanosecond and picosecond time resolved photoluminescence measurements. Surface plasma resonant absorption peak of gold nanofilm was adjusted {{to meet the}} near resonant conditions with the fluorescence peak of quantum dot by changing the thickness. Surface <b>trapping</b> <b>state</b> was {{proved to be the}} origin of the long lifetime component by comparing fresh and eight months aged quantum dot. It was observed that the excitonic state lifetime of the quantum dots was reduced by nonradiative resonant energy transfer to gold nanofilm. Nonradiative resonant energy transfer time, which was comparable with the surface trapping time, was calculated based on the data of picosecond photoluminescence measurements. No nonradiative energy transfer from surface <b>trapping</b> <b>state</b> to gold nanofilm, thus the lifetime of surface <b>trapping</b> <b>state</b> was not affected obviously. It is suggested that in the assembly combined with quantum dot and gold nanostructure, nonradiative energy transfer will occur after the population of excitonic state, and compete with surface trapping process.

50|$|The {{two most}} common types of TLDs are calcium {{fluoride}} and lithium fluoride, {{with one or}} more impurities to produce <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> for energetic electrons. The former is used to record gamma exposure, the latter for gamma and neutron exposure (indirectly, using the Li-6 (n,alpha) nuclear reaction; for this reason, LiF dosimeters may be enriched in lithium-6 to enhance this effect or enriched in lithium-7 to reduce it). Other types include beryllium oxide, calcium sulfate doped with Tm. As the radiation interacts with the crystal it causes electrons in the crystal's atoms to jump to higher energy states, where they stay trapped due to intentionally introduced impurities (usually manganese or magnesium) in the crystal, until heated. Heating the crystal causes the electrons to drop back to their ground state, releasing a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the trap state and the ground state.|$|E
5000|$|Another major {{challenge}} for perovskite solar cells is {{the observation that}} current-voltage scans yield ambiguous efficiency values.The power-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is usually determined by characterizing its current-voltage (IV) behavior under simulated solar illumination. In contrast to other solar cells, however, {{it has been observed}} that the IV-curves of perovskite solar cells show a hysteretic behavior: depending on scanning conditions - such as scan direction, scan speed, light soaking, biasing - there is a discrepancy between the scan from forward-bias to short-circuit (FB-SC) and the scan from short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB). Various causes have been proposed such as ion movement, polarization, ferroelectric effects, filling of <b>trap</b> <b>states,</b> [...] however, the exact origin for the hysteretic behavior is yet to be determined. But it appears that determining the solar cell efficiency from IV-curves risks producing inflated values if the scanning parameters exceed the time-scale which the perovskite system requires in order to reach an electronic steady-state. Two possible solutions have been proposed: Unger et al. show that extremely slow voltage-scans allow the system to settle into steady-state conditions at every measurement point which thus eliminates any discrepancy between the FB-SC and the SC-FB scan. Henry Snaith et al. have proposed 'stabilized power output' as a metric for the efficiency of a solar cell. This value is determined by holding the tested device at a constant voltage around the maximum power-point (where the product of voltage and photocurrent reaches its maximum value) and track the power-output until it reaches a constant value.Both methods have been demonstrated to yield lower efficiency values when compared to efficiencies determined by fast IV-scans. However, initial studies have been published that show that surface passivation of the perovskite absorber is an avenue with which efficiency values can be stabilized very close to fast-scan efficiencies.Initial reports suggest that in the 'inverted architecture', which has a transparent cathode, little to no hysteresis is observed. This suggests that the interfaces might play a crucial role with regards to the hysteretic IV behavior since the major difference of the inverted architecture to the regular architectures is that an organic n-type contact is used instead of a metal oxide.|$|E

40|$|Traps effects (due to the {{presence}} of surface-state densities and deep-levels) in AlGaN/GaN HEMT devices cause slow current transients referred as gate-lag and drain-lag effects that become a cause of so called current collapse.
