He eventually gravitated to more independent comics, such as Daniel Clowes' David Boring and Art Spiegelman’s Maus. His favorite comics today are Sandman Mystery Theatre and the work of Johnny Ryan. His dream comic to own is Adventure Comics #40, which is the 1939 first appearance of the Golden Age Sandman. Parker began working at Midtown Comics after discovering that they were hiring while visiting friends in New York City from his native Tampa, Florida. He and Alex later appeared in Episode 6 of the VH1 reality series For What It's Worth, in which they appraised Tony Moore's original artwork for Page 7 of The Walking Dead #1.|$|R
