5|$|The Haarlem Specimen (TM 6428/29, {{also known}} as the Teyler Specimen) was {{discovered}} in 1855 near Riedenburg, Germany, and described as a Pterodactylus crassipes in 1857 by Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by John Ostrom and is currently located at the <b>Teylers</b> <b>Museum</b> in Haarlem, Netherlands. It was the very first specimen found, but was incorrectly classified at the time. It {{is also one of the}} least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones, isolated cervical vertebrae, and ribs.|$|E
5|$|On {{occasion}} a Ruisdael changes hands. In 2014, Dunes by the Sea was auctioned at Christie's in New York, and realised a {{price of}} $1,805,000. Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the Rijksmuseum, the <b>Teylers</b> <b>Museum</b> in Haarlem, Dresden's Kupferstich-Kabinett, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael's rare etchings are spread across institutions. No collection holds a print {{of each of the}} thirteen etchings. Of the five unique prints, the British Museum holds two, two are in the Albertina in Vienna, and one is in Amsterdam.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} museums in Haarlem. The <b>Teylers</b> <b>Museum</b> {{lies on the}} Spaarne river and is the oldest museum of the Netherlands. Its main {{subjects}} are art, science and natural history, and it owns a number of works by Michelangelo and Rembrandt. Another museum is the Frans Hals Museum of fine arts, with its main location housing Dutch master paintings, and its exhibition halls on the Grote Markt housing a gallery for modern art called De Hallen. Also on the Grote Markt, in the cellar of the Vleeshal is the Archeologisch Museum Haarlem, while across the square on Saturdays, the Hoofdwacht building is open with exhibitions on Haarlem history.|$|E
25|$|When the French revolutionary forces {{occupied}} Maastricht in 1794, {{the carefully}} hidden fossil was uncovered, after a reward, it is said, of 600 bottles of wine, and transported to Paris. After {{it had been}} earlier interpreted as a fish, a crocodile, and a sperm whale, the first to understand its lizard affinities was the Dutch scientist Adriaan Gilles Camper in 1799. In 1808, Georges Cuvier confirmed this conclusion, although le Grand Animal fossile de Maëstricht was not actually named Mosasaurus ('Meuse reptile') until 1822 and not given its full species name, Mosasaurus hoffmannii, until 1829. Several sets of mosasaur remains, that had been discovered earlier at Maastricht but were not identified as mosasaurs until the 19th century, have been {{on display in the}} <b>Teylers</b> <b>Museum,</b> Haarlem, procured from 1790.|$|E
50|$|The commonly-used {{names of}} this {{specimen}} {{come from the}} old Dutch town of Haarlem, {{as well as from}} the town's <b>Teyler</b> <b>Museum,</b> named for its founder Pieter Teyler van der Hulst. In the 19th century the museum acquired a huge number of fossils from Solnhofen, and between 1863 and 1868 it listed over 12,000 fossils in its paleontological collection. In March 1860, a seemingly unremarkable vertebrate fossil from Riedenburg, Bavaria, was purchased from von Meyer by the then-director of the <b>Teyler</b> <b>Museum,</b> Jacob Gijsbertus Samuël van Breda (Winkler 1865). This piece had been described in 1857 as belonging to the pterosaur Pterodactylus crassipes by H. v. Meyer (v. Meyer 1857), and the <b>Teyler</b> <b>Museum</b> displayed it as such for over a century.|$|R
40|$|<b>Teyler’s</b> <b>Museum</b> in Haarlem, today one of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} historic institutions in the Netherlands, owes its existence to the estate of textile merchant and banker Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702 – 1778). However, the foundations for both the collections and the building which houses this encyclopaedic museum of nature and art were laid largely thanks to the efforts of one man, the physician and natural philosopher Martinus van Marum (1750 – 1837), first director of <b>Teyler’s</b> <b>Museum</b> from 1784. The present article focuses on Van Marum’s efforts to establish contacts with Russia alongside his many international connections. It examines how and why he attempted to gain foreign membership of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and how and why he endeavoured to augment the <b>Teyler’s</b> <b>Museum</b> collections through the acquisition of books on Russia, Siberian minerals and a highly powerful Russian magnet. It also attempts to explain why some of his efforts were more successful than others...|$|R

50|$|Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (25 March 1702 - 8 April 1778) was {{a wealthy}} Dutch Mennonite {{merchant}} and banker, who died childless, leaving {{a legacy of}} two million florins (in today's terms: about EUR 80 million) {{to the pursuit of}} religion, arts and science in his hometown, that {{led to the formation of}} <b>Teyler's</b> <b>Museum.</b> This was not the value of his entire estate.

50|$|In the 18th century, {{the ruling}} classes of Amsterdam (where Teyler had his banking offices) and Haarlem were all Protestants, {{as was the}} Dutch Stadtholder.

50|$|Hubertus {{started as}} a {{landscape}} painter, but his best work was not in that style. His love of color and bright light was best displayed in his doorkijkjes, or domestic vistas, {{in the style of}} Pieter de Hooch. These were views of outdoor light seen through an interior, a room or kitchen situated between the street door and an inner yard. <b>Teyler's</b> <b>Museum</b> possesses an excellent specimen in The Knitter, a picture which is of a lively composition and shows an inclination for a stronger and fresher coloring than prevailed in Van Hove's day.|$|R
5000|$|Behind the St. Bavochurch the {{printing}} factory of Joh.

50|$|In October 1966, Peter Wellnhofer {{visited the}} <b>Teyler</b> <b>Museum</b> to examine its {{collection}} of Solnhofen pterosaurs, disputing its assignment to P. crassipes. However, {{it was not}} until 8 September 1970 that the fossil was finally recognized as belonging to Archaeopteryx by John Ostrom, who was also at the time engaged in studying Solnhofen pterosaurs and was suspicious of the species assignment of this pterosaur. His reclassification of von Meyer's P. crassipes type specimen as an Archaeopteryx was published in Science in 1970 (Ostrom 1970), with a more thorough investigation of the specimen two years later in the Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (Ostrom 1972b). In this way, the so-called fourth specimen of Archaeopteryx, preceded in the literature by the London, Berlin and Maxberg specimens, was in reality the first, discovered as it was originally in 1855—five years before the feather that would ultimately reveal the existence of avians in the Jurassic.|$|R
5000|$|As an artist, Verdizotti {{is mainly}} remembered for his {{friendship}} with Titian, whose pupil he was, and later his secretary from 1556. No painted work can be attributed with certainty to him but, judging from the prints in his [...] "100 Moral Fables" [...] (Cento favole morali), his speciality was small landscapes with tiny figures. There is a signed pen and ink drawing by him of Cephalus and Procris (Brunswick, Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum), which resembles Titian's graphic style. Other drawings attributed to Verdizotti are a pen and ink Landscape with Houses (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana) and the Titian-like Study of a Tree (Madrid, Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando). He probably also executed the pen and wash drawing of [...] "A Bear Devouring a Rabbit in a Landscape" [...] (Florence, Uffizi), which has as motto naturam ars vincit, a work close in style to the woodcuts that illustrate his fables. Similarly, the supposed ink portrait of Titian (Haarlem, <b>Teyler's</b> <b>Museum)</b> {{is close to the}} [...] "Cephalus and Procris".|$|R
5000|$|Division of the octave into 31 steps arose {{naturally}} out of Renaissance music theory; {{the lesser}} diesis [...] - [...] {{the ratio of}} an octave to three major thirds, 128:125 or 41.06 cents — was approximately a fifth of a tone {{and a third of}} a semitone. In 1666, Lemme Rossi first proposed an equal temperament of this order. Shortly thereafter, having discovered it independently, scientist Christiaan Huygens wrote about it also. Since the standard system of tuning at that time was quarter-comma meantone, in which the fifth is tuned to , the appeal of this method was immediate, as the fifth of 31-ET, at 696.77 cents, is only 0.19 cent wider than the fifth of quarter-comma meantone. Huygens not only realized this, he went farther and noted that 31-ET provides an excellent approximation of septimal, or 7-limit harmony. In the twentieth century, physicist, music theorist and composer Adriaan Fokker, after reading Huygens's work, led a revival of interest in this system of tuning which led to a number of compositions, particularly by Dutch composers. Fokker designed the Fokker organ, a 31-tone equal-tempered organ, which was installed in <b>Teyler's</b> <b>Museum</b> in Haarlem in 1951 and moved to Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in 2010 where it's frequently used in concerts since it moved.|$|R
