The first assumes that dissolved gas is eliminated while in the dissolved phase, and that bubbles are not formed during asymptomatic decompression. The second, which is supported by experimental observation, assumes that bubbles are formed during most asymptomatic decompressions, and <b>that</b> <b>gas</b> elimination must consider both dissolved and bubble phases.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found <b>that</b> <b>gas</b> could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} groups of {{dissolved}} phase models: In parallel compartment models, several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition {{is controlled by the}} compartment that shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile. These compartments represent conceptual tissues and don't represent specific organic tissues. They merely represent the range of possibilities for the organic tissues. The second group uses serial compartments, which assumes <b>that</b> <b>gas</b> diffuses through one compartment before it reaches the next.|$|E

30|$|A {{comparison}} of diffusion coefficients {{of natural gas}} in foamy oil, saturated oil, and dead oil {{at the same pressure}} indicates that diffusion coefficients of natural gas in foamy oil are lower than <b>that</b> of <b>gas</b> in saturated oil and dead oil. For example, the diffusion coefficients of natural gas in dead oil are 3.02 and 4.02 times than <b>that</b> of <b>gas</b> in saturated oil and foamy oil when the pressure is 20  MPa.

25|$|Patients who {{complain}} of bloating frequently {{can be shown}} to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined {{with the fact that}} the total volume of flatus is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found <b>that</b> <b>gas</b> was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension. In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased flatus production.|$|E
