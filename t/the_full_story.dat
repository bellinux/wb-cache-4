5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws {{did not tell}} <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>story</b> about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, {{he was able to}} tease out what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contributor}} to the critical oblivion was the loss of archival documents or, indeed, the artwork itself, often dismembered if not destroyed.

While a catalog of his works of art has been reconstructed within the framework of the Renaissance in Brescia, <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>story</b> still suffers from gaps and there are still events to be clarified.|$|E

With his brother's parting words, and accepting defeat after his final battle with Naruto, Sasuke renounces destroying the village and devotes himself to protecting it, fulfilling Itachi's wish for his younger brother. Sasuke even adopts Itachi's habit of poking on the forehead as a sign of affection, which Sasuke does with his wife Sakura and daughter Sarada.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>story</b> of the discoveries.|$|E

25|$|Colditz: <b>The</b> <b>Full</b> <b>Story</b> (1984) : While {{the first}} two books {{can be read as}} {{adventure}} narratives, and have a distinctly ‘Battler Briton’ ethos of ‘sticking one up to the goons’ this book takes a more analytic approach, and covers a number of previously suppressed details. For example, Reid describes some of the ways prisoners obtained contraband material, and how British prisoners communicated clandestinely with the authorities in London. He also gives a full account of how prisoners discovered the 'Singen Escape Route'. He also deals with some of the tensions and tragedies of wartime Europe, for example the tensions in the French contingents between Gaullists and supporters of Pétain. The tensions in the Polish contingent are still skated over however. The book was written while Poland was still a Communist state (indeed while the 1981 state of emergency was still operating). Having been schooled at Clongowes, Reid's comments on individuals seem to show sympathy for the 'Conservative Catholic Patriot' officers at Colditz, without giving enough background to allow readers to assess whether there were any continuing controversies around some of these positions.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing <b>the</b> child's <b>full</b> <b>story</b> helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing <b>the</b> child's <b>full</b> <b>story</b> helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|R
25|$|On 26 November, the Polish FA {{reversed}} {{their decision}} to send three sets of officials, stating they were now required for games in Poland, followed by the Portuguese FA, who had sent teams of officials to cover the two Sunday SPL games, only to board a return flight {{as soon as they}} arrived at Glasgow Airport. The withdrawals led to the last remaining Division One game being called off, and two of three Scottish Cup replays also being called off, and cast doubt over cover for the remaining fixtures. Scottish broadcaster STV claimed the Polish referees pulled out after they realised they were providing cover for striking referees, having initially believed they were participating in an exchange programme. On the eve of the strike, the Israeli FA stated it might not have sent referees had it been given <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>story</b> behind the request by the SFA, while the Luxembourg FA stated they had not been given the reasons behind the SFA's request, but that they had been following the dispute on the internet.|$|E
25|$|Snape first {{appears in}} Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, shortly after Harry arrives at Hogwarts. He is the school's Potions Master, {{though he is}} widely rumoured to covet the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. Snape himself {{confirms}} the rumour in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Snape is a sinister and malicious teacher who makes frequent snide and disparaging remarks at Harry's expense. He quickly becomes the primary antagonist of the book, as Harry suspects him of plotting to steal the philosopher's stone, and of attempting to kill him. Only {{the climax of the}} book reveals that Professor Quirrell, in league with Lord Voldemort, is the real enemy; Snape, suspicious of Quirrell, had been looking out for Harry throughout the book. In the final chapter, Dumbledore suggests that because Harry's father James had saved Snape's life when they were both students, even though the two detested each other, Snape felt responsible for Harry in return. As the final book reveals, this is not <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>story.</b> In any case, even after Quirrell's true role is revealed, Harry retains feelings of suspicion and resentment towards Snape, and their relationship remains tense. Snape's behaviour and attitude towards Harry also remain unchanged.|$|E

500|$|In {{her final}} soliloquy, Brünnhilde thanks the Rhinemaidens for their [...] "good advice".

Brünnhilde sings: [...] "What you desire I will give you: from my ashes take it to yourselves. The fire...will cleanse the curse from the ring". She exhorts the Rhinemaidens to [...] "carefully guard it" [...] in the future, then leaps into the flames of Siegfried's pyre. The fire blazes up to fill the stage, representing the destruction of the gods. As the Rhine overflows its banks the Rhinemaidens appear, making for the ring. Hagen, who covets the ring, shouts to them [...] "Get back from the ring!" [...] (Zurück vom Ring!), the last words of the drama. He is seized by Woglinde and Wellgunde and dragged into the Rhine's depths, as Flosshilde grabs the ring, holds it aloft, and joins her sisters [...] swimming in circles as the waters of the Rhine [...] gradually subside.|$|E
500|$|The {{addition}} of a futuristic Temporal Cold War element {{was seen as a}} [...] "nod to mystery" [...] by Rick Berman, who sought to add an element of The X-Files to the series.

At the start of the second season, Braga said that the Temporal Cold War storyline would continue to be included if viewers were still interested, but later described it as [...] "strangulating". Initially featured in the pilot episode, [...] "Broken Bow", it featured the Suliban being manipulated by an unknown humanoid figure from the future, nicknamed [...] "Future Guy" [...] by viewers—a moniker later adopted by the series's writers. At the start of the series, Braga said that they did not have a plan for whom the character would turn out to be. Ten years after the end of the series, Braga stated on Twitter that Future Guy was Archer manipulating his own timeline; he and Berman had previously stated, however, that the character was intended to be a Romulan.|$|E
