5|$|The {{house was}} used by Ames, and later by Connecticut College, as a rental property, until the {{structure}} was slated for demolition in 2004. <b>The</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> restore the house is credited to Doug Royalty, who worked with the college's Abigail Van Slyck. Completed in 2013, restoration cost $500,000 and involved several phases, including the dismantling, transportation, and reassembly of the house. The house {{was added to the}} Connecticut Historic Register in July 2007 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 2009.|$|E
5|$|There were {{increasing}} {{signs of}} heavy communist logistical activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded {{just such a}} North Vietnamese offensive. Communist offensives usually took place near {{the conclusion of the}} Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN logistical forces, <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> move supplies through the system came {{during the height of the}} season. One U.S. intelligence report estimated that 90 percent of PAVN materiel coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail was being funneled into the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, indicating forward stockpiling in preparation for offensive action. This build-up was alarming to both Washington and the American command, and prompted the perceived necessity for a spoiling attack to derail future communist objectives.|$|E
5|$|Colbourn {{established}} the university's honors program, {{and started the}} university's first satellite branch campus. In addition, Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park, located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978. The park serves as {{a major focus of}} simulation for space and defense-related research. The park was one part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. However, Colbourn's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of growth for the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.|$|E

50|$|Hitting a moonball to a pusher's backhand {{side will}} often {{force them to}} hit a lob, {{allowing}} a relatively leisurely overhead to end the point. In some cases, players may be able <b>to</b> outlast <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> by hitting several cross-court strokes and waiting for <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> <b>to</b> hit a ball that can be volleyed away. If a player does not {{put a lot of}} topspin on their shots, their opponent may well try to control the center court. This forces <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> <b>to</b> go for more deeper and angled shots, which are harder to hit without topspin.|$|R

5|$|In 2008, {{an article}} in The Day stated that <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> restore the house came from {{conservation}} specialist Doug Royalty, who was researching prefabricated homes from the 1920s and 1930s. Royalty approached Abigail Van Slyck, the chairwoman of Connecticut College's art history department and architectural studies program about the house. The Day referred to the house's historic value as a new discovery, but its history {{was included in the}} Winslow Ames House National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1995. The Winslow Ames House nomination detailed the House's origin, but criticized its gable roof modification. After its re-discovery, Connecticut College began collecting grants to restore the house under the direction of Royalty and Van Slyck. Royalty stated that the House and Winslow Ames House are very rare, with only a few surviving examples in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people have}} been {{important}} in <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> develop {{the game in the}} Cook Islands and raise the profile of the national netball team on the global stage. They include Anna Noovao, who was the captain of the 1992 New Zealand side, Margharet Matenga, who was the first Cook Islands player to play for New Zealand's national team, and Mamia, who was the secretary of the Cook Islands Netball Association for six years. Mamia was an umpire and an umpire examiner for the Oceania region. She attended South Pacific Games in Micronesia, the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, and the Olympic Games in Sydney. Mamia was a national representative for teams that had competed in the South Pacific Games during the 1980s. Tina Pupuke Browne was president of the Cook Islands Netball Association. Elizabeth Tou was coach of the national team from 2005 to 2007. She represented the country as a player at Pacific Games, Commonwealth Games and the World Championships.|$|E

25|$|During October 2007, a {{group called}} We Are North Melbourne emerged and {{launched}} a public campaign, calling for ordinary members {{to be given the}} final say on the relocation issue. While the group became synonymous with <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club's shareholder structure wound-up and control returned to ordinary members.|$|E
25|$|The event frightened slaveholders, {{as black}} men not only fought back but prevailed. Some feared this would inspire enslaved blacks and {{encourage}} rebelliousness. The case was prosecuted in Philadelphia U.S. District Court under the Fugitive Slave Act, which required citizens {{to cooperate in}} the capture and return of fugitive slaves. The disturbance increased regional and racial tensions. In the North, it added to <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> abolish slavery.|$|E

25|$|Though {{some critics}} charged that Jewish {{interests}} were partially responsible for <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> war with Iraq, Jewish Americans were actually more strongly {{opposed to the}} Iraq war from its onset than any other religious group, or even most Americans. The greater {{opposition to the war}} was not simply a result of high Democratic identification among U.S. Jews, as Jews of all political persuasions were more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who shared the same political leanings.|$|E
25|$|The body rotates {{about its}} long axis with every arm stroke {{so that the}} {{shoulder}} of the recovering arm is higher than {{the shoulder of the}} pushing/pulling arm. This makes the recovery much easier and reduces the need to turn the head to breathe. As one shoulder is out of the water, it reduces drag, and as it falls it aids the arm catching the water; as the other shoulder rises it aids the arm at end of <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> leave the water.|$|E
25|$|After recuperating in England, Young {{returned}} to the Western Front on 4 December 1917 and assumed command of the 1st Infantry Brigade with the rank of temporary Brigadier-General. He was subsequently shifted to command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade on 19 February 1918, and led it during the German Spring Offensive which began in March 1918. He retained command of the brigade {{for the remainder of}} the war and saw further action at the Battle of Bapaume and in <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> the Hindenburg Line which contributed to German capitulation in November 1918.|$|E

25|$|Operation Watch on the Rhine, {{followed}} by Operation Nordwind were the final major offensives and last gambles Hitler {{made on the}} Western Front. The plan was for an armored push through the American lines, {{all the way to}} Antwerp to split the western Allies forces and buy the Germans time. Mohnke's SS Division Leibstandarte, attached to the I SS Panzer Corps, was the spearhead of the operation in the Ardennes. The fuel crisis in Nazi Germany meant that the LSSAH had insufficient amounts of fuel for the vehicles. On 16 December 1944 the operation began, with Mohnke designating SS-Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's Kampfgruppe to lead <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> Antwerp.|$|E
25|$|The Extended Cut {{provides}} additional {{scenes and}} dialogue {{towards the end}} of the story. Shepard's squadmates are critically injured (incinerated if EMS is low) by Harbinger during <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> the Citadel beam, forcing Shepard to call in the Normandy to extract them. Shepard can now refuse to activate the Crucible, leading to a fourth ending where the Reapers destroy all advanced life in the galaxy, but are defeated in the next cycle via knowledge from one of Liara's beacons. Otherwise, the flashbacks after Shepard's final decision have also been adjusted: the first is Anderson, the second is someone who died during the events of the story, and the third is Shepard's love interest. The mass relays are now severely damaged instead of being destroyed by the Crucible's firing unless EMS is low.|$|E

25|$|In Steve Lenius' {{original}} 2001 {{paper he}} explored {{the acceptance of}} bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily {{the territory of the}} gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>to</b> be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé, who {{has covered}} [...] "At Last" [...] {{which is a}} song {{originally}} recorded by James, portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal.
