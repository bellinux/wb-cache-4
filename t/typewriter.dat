5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} <b>typewriter.</b> Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the <b>typewriter,</b> clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. The <b>typewriter</b> succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
50|$|Soviet {{embassies}} used manual <b>typewriters,</b> {{rather than}} electric <b>typewriters,</b> for classified information—apparently {{because they are}} immune to such bugs.As of 2013, Russian special services still use <b>typewriters.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the <b>typewriter,</b> and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. <b>Typewriter</b> production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The <b>typewriter,</b> however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the <b>typewriter</b> {{received}} an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, {{and the need}} for trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century, however, had created a need for expedient, legible correspondence, and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. The <b>typewriter</b> is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{arguments}} against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of the <b>typewriter,</b> and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{possible}} to connect some machines to certain electric <b>typewriters</b> {{for use as a}} printer (the <b>typewriters</b> are also able to be connected to PCs for this purpose, and the interface tends to be a standard RS-232 and/or DIN plug), and in some cases to access the <b>typewriter's</b> floppy or micro floppy drives.|$|R
5|$|Production of the No. 20 resumed around 1947, {{at which}} time the company began to license the Oliver name to several European {{manufacturing}} companies. The standard desktop machine was eventually discontinued in favor of portable models; the company began to sell a German design, the Siemag Standard, as the Oliver standard. In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron <b>Typewriter</b> Company, previously the Barlock <b>Typewriter</b> Company, of Nottingham. The licensing ventures were ultimately unsuccessful, and the company's machine tools were transferred to a factory in Germany. Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.|$|E
5|$|SGDs {{have their}} roots in early {{electronic}} communication aids. The first such aid was a sip-and-puff <b>typewriter</b> controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960. POSSUM scanned {{through a set of}} symbols on an illuminated display. Researchers at Delft University in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated <b>typewriter</b> (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small spot of light at a matrix of characters, each equipped with a photoelectric cell. Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.|$|E
5|$|The Oliver <b>Typewriter</b> Company {{had begun}} {{operating}} in 1895, with its headquarters {{on the ninth}} floor of a building {{on the corner of}} Clark and Randolph Street in Chicago. In 1896, manufacturing moved from Iowa to Woodstock, Illinois, when the City of Woodstock donated a vacant factory once used by the Wheeler and Tappan Company on the condition that the Oliver <b>Typewriter</b> Company remain there at least five years. Manufacturing was divided into six departments: type bar, carriage, assembly, tabulators and adjustment, inspection, and an aligning room. The company's headquarters moved to the Oliver Building, now a Chicago landmark on the National Register of Historic Places, when it was completed in 1907.|$|E

25|$|A rather {{specialized}} {{market for}} <b>typewriters</b> exists {{due to the}} regulations of many correctional systems in the US, where prisoners are prohibited from having computers or telecommunication equipment, but are allowed to own <b>typewriters.</b> The Swintec corporation (headquartered in Moonachie, New Jersey), which, as of 2011, still produced <b>typewriters</b> at its overseas factories (in Japan, Indonesia, and/or Malaysia), manufactures a variety of <b>typewriters</b> for use in prisons, made of clear plastic (to {{make it harder for}} prisoners to hide prohibited items inside it). As of 2011, the company had contracts with prisons in 43 US states.|$|R

5|$|In the pre-digital period, IBM offered Aldine, a font {{inspired}} by Bembo, as a font for the IBM Composer. This was an ultra-premium electric golfball <b>typewriter</b> system, intended for producing copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects, or for high-quality office documents. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, {{as it was}} displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, {{and then in the}} 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers.|$|E

A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of {{his fingers on the}} <b>typewriter</b> keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E

Other variations include the aptly named [...] "Cheap Shot" [...] where the player touches the ball into another square, and then throws it in the opposite direction, often far from the playing court. <b>Typewriters</b> and other variations on this rule are forbidden unless the center square enables them.|$|R
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{commercial}} popularity of <b>typewriters</b> in the 1970s, a number of hybrid designs combining features of printers were introduced. [...] These often incorporated keyboards from existing models of <b>typewriters</b> and printing mechanisms of dot-matrix printers. The generation of teleprinters with impact pin-based printing engines was not adequate for the demanding quality required for typed output, and alternative thermal transfer technologies used in thermal label printers had become technically feasible for <b>typewriters.</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{were some}} {{similarities}} between Ernő and Auric: both were Jewish immigrants {{who came to}} Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists, although they were physically very different. The likely model for Goldfinger was American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., who Fleming had met in 1949. Englehard had established a company, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous export restrictions, selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong. Fleming had reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London {{with a list of}} queries about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including smuggling. Fleming himself liked gold enough to commission a gold-plated <b>typewriter</b> from the Royal <b>Typewriter</b> Company, although he never actually used it. In 1995, this machine was purchased by the Bond actor, Pierce Brosnan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Typewriter</b> in the Sky is {{a science}} fiction novel written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The protagonist Mike de Wolf finds himself inside {{the story of his}} friend Horace Hackett's book. He must survive {{conflict}} on the high seas in the Caribbean during the 17th century, before eventually returning to his native New York City. Each time a significant event occurs to the protagonist in the story he hears the sounds of a <b>typewriter</b> in the sky. At the story's conclusion, de Wolf wonders if he is still a character in someone else's story. The work was first published in a two-part serial format in 1940 in Unknown Fantasy Fiction. It was twice published as a combined book with Hubbard's work Fear. In 1995 Bridge Publications re-released the work along with an audio edition.|$|E
50|$|In {{the history}} of <b>typewriters,</b> early <b>typewriters</b> were {{initially}} thought to be replacements for printing and so featured proportional fonts.
