There are also some effective indicators such as residents’ income, age, and self-selection factors related to this case that cannot be evaluated easily, which question the reliability of previous efforts to describe the effects of private motorized <b>trips</b> <b>indicators</b> on car usage universally. On the other hand, private motorized <b>trips</b> <b>indicators</b> are effective factors that influence travel behavior but these indicators have not been evaluated in considerable studies. This paper introduces a multiple-linear regression analysis to estimate the relationship of private motorized <b>trips</b> <b>indicators</b> and car usage in various cities {{in different parts of}} the world with various socio-economic contexts. So, the results of this study are reliable enough to illustrate this relationship with international scale.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of the limit order book recovery in the purely order-driven markets. The configuration of the current limit placements in the order book determines the costs over the mid-quote for the buy and sell trades. By analyzing the relationship between the costs of the possible trades and market order-flows, we find that bid and ask side trade costs have significant impact on the direction of future market orders. Moreover, bid and ask side trade costs revert to their characteristic state. For the further analysis of limit order placement strategies, we extend the cost of trade approach by several attributes of the entire limit order book. Using snaphots about cost of round <b>trip</b> <b>indicators</b> from Budapest Stock Exchange stocks, we decompose the shape of the immediate price impact function to main three components, slope, convexity and hump-shape. By running impluse response simulations, we document the typical temporary movements of the trade costs curves and we find empirical evidences about the "pegging to the current mid-quote" behavior of the liquidity providers...|$|R

50|$|In 1956 {{although}} the Super was larger Buick, with vertical windshield posts and four VentiPorts per fender, {{it had a}} deep Sweepspear similar to the smaller Series 40 Special and Series 60 Century cars. Series script was found on rear quarters and within the deck and grille emblems. Interiors were Cordaveen and patterned nylon, except for convertibles which were all-Cordaveen trimmed and had power windows, horizontal seat adjustment(Six-way power seats were optional), and a power top in its standard form. Dynaflow was now standard on all Supers, along with foam seat cushions, a trunk light, electric clock, directional signals, front and rear armrests, sliding sunshades, cigarette lighter, glove compartment light, map light, dual horns, Step-On parking brake, Red Liner speedometer and <b>trip</b> mileage <b>indicator.</b> A new body style was the 4-door Riviera hardtop.

50|$|The once {{most popular}} Buick line {{was reduced to}} two body styles for 1958 with the {{elimination}} of the convertible. Side trim was similar to lesser series, except for the Super lettering on the rear fender flashes, but Supers were longer than the Series 40 Specials and Series 60 Centurys. The Super name was also lettered across the deck lid. Standard equipment included Variable-Pitch Dynaflow, power steering, power brakes, a safety-cushion instrument panel, fully carpeted floor, courtesy lights, full wheelcovers, foam rubber cushions, electric clocks, dual horns, ignition key light, glovebox, cigar lighter, <b>trip</b> mileage <b>indicator,</b> geared vent panes, bumper guards, variable speed wipers, Step-On parking brakes, and, on convertibles, an outside rearview mirror. Interiors were trimmed with gray cloth and vinyl or Cordaveen and vinyl. A plusher Custom interior was available at extra cost.

Supers had {{a group of}} three Chevrons on each rear quarter or door for series identification, in addition to the normal wording within the grille and deck emblems. Four VentiPorts were used on each front fender. Closed models were upholstered in Nylon/Cordaveen combinations while the convertible had an all-Cordaveen interior and featured power windows and seat controls as part of its equipment. Standard Super equipment included foam rubber seat cushions, automatic trunk lamp, Red Liner speedometer, glovebox lamp, dual horns, <b>trip</b> mileage <b>indicator,</b> directional signals, dual sunshades, color coordinated dash panel, and on the convertible, outside left-hand rearview mirror.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the desirability for High-Occupancy/Toll (HOT) lanes in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) through stated preference and revealed traffic volume data gathering and analysis techniques. 4, 000 surveys, distributed in five sample areas, asked respondents {{how much they}} would be willing to pay to escape congestion in eight unique trip conditions. Stated preference results found considerable public support for HOT-lanes in the GTA. In six out of eight trip conditions, a majority of respondents preferred to pay to travel in express lanes rather than endure congestion. Respondent willingness to pay (WTP) mean values varied considerably by trip condition. Willingness to pay to escape congestion was influenced by trip characteristics and driver factors. Trip urgency, traffic speed, and freeway trip distance were found to be statistically significant <b>trip</b> characteristic <b>indicators</b> of WTP. Previous exposure to electronic tolling and annual household income were found to be significant driver factor indicators of WTP in most trip conditions. Respondent gender and freeway travel frequency were found to be statistically significant driver factor indicators of WTP in some trip conditions. The presence of Hwy 407 -ETR, an electronically tolled by-pass to Hwy 401, allowed for an examination of the effects of Hwy 401 volume and trip urgency on driver choice to use the tolled alternative. Results indicated that trip urgency and Hwy 401 volume were correlated with Hwy 407 throughput share. During periods of high trip urgency and high Hwy 401 volume, a substantial proportion of Hwy 401 / 407 corridor drivers chose to pay approximately $ 0. 20 /km to escape congestion...|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{provides an}} example of how biodiversity can be measured by means of different indicators, and how the latter can be used to assess the influence of the biodiversity profile of a region on the tourism flows towards it. Previous studies have considered environmental amenities as one of the determinants of tourism destination choice. The central hypothesis of this paper is that the destination’s biodiversity profile can be considered as a key component of environmental amenities. The main objective {{of this study is to}} propose a different perspective on this topic, considering the role of biodiversity on tourists’ choice of destination and duration of stay. Domestic Irish tourist flows have been chosen as a case study. The first step of the analysis required the construction of biodiversity indicators suitable for developing a biodiversity profile of each Irish county. Subsequently, a model was developed so as to explain the total number of nights spent in any location as a function of a set of explanatory variables including information about the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, biodiversity and the landscape profile of the county of destination and features of the trip. Results show that most of the biodiversity and landscape indicators included in the analysis turn out to be statistically significant in determining tourists’ choices regarding the duration of their trip. As a result, policies pursuing biodiversity conservation appear to have a positive impact on the revenue of regional tourism.

5000|$|Voltage {{withstand}} {{testing is}} done with a high voltage source and voltage and current meters. A single instrument called a [...] "hipot tester" [...] {{is often used to}} perform this test. It applies the necessary voltages to a device and monitors leakage current. The current can <b>trip</b> a fault <b>indicator.</b> The tester has output overload protection. The test voltage may be either direct current or alternating current at power frequency or other frequency, like resonant frequency (30 to 300 Hz determined by load) or VLF (0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz), when convenient. The maximum voltage is given in the test standard for the particular product. The application rate may also be adjusted to manage leakage currents resulting from inherent capacitive effects of the test object. The duration of the test may be up to 60 seconds or more. The applied voltage, rate of application and test duration depend on the specification requirements of the equipment. Different test standards apply for consumer electronics, military electrical devices, high voltage cables, switchgear and other apparatus.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article {{investigates the}} links between urban form and {{commuting}} patterns, and the CO 2 emissions associated with them, in the municipalities that comprise the New Town of Marne-la-Vallée (NTMV) located in the Paris Region. The paper distinguishes between the commutes performed by residents and those generated by the jobs located in a municipality. The contribution of the paper is twofold. Firstly, {{it shows that the}} CO 2 emissions of commutes differ greatly depending on whether one considers residents or jobs: hence focusing on the travel behaviour of residents can lead to significant errors in the assessment of the CO 2 emissions generated by a municipality, and therefore its environmental sustainability. Secondly, the paper explores the relationship between commuting <b>trips</b> and several <b>indicators</b> of urban form: density, compactness, jobs-to-residents ratio, accessibility to public transport and distance from Paris. We highlight that high jobs-to-residents ratios tend to increase the proportion of jobs held by residents. Density and compactness are associated with more sustainable travel behaviour among residents, but not non-residents. Finally, the shape of the public transport system, which mainly connects the municipalities of the NTMV with Paris, tends to decrease the proportion of jobs held by residents, especially in the municipalities that are close to Paris, and does not allow non-residents, most of whom do not travel from Paris, to use public transport...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{planning}} literature documents {{high density}} urban development, low car usage, {{large numbers of}} non-motorized and public transport <b>trips,</b> as <b>indicators</b> of a high quality sustainable urban transport system. Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, relatively fulfills the requirements of these indicators. However, Wellington´s transport planning over {{the last fifty years}} has been focused on private vehicles and building wide and better roads, motorways and tunnels. Main stream politicians as well as transport professionals present these projects as urban transport achievements. Unfortunately, the massive road infrastructure projects absorb all transport funding in the city and shift attention away from the core issues of integrating land use and transport planning. In fact, all these projects were based on faulty assumptions that traffic congestion would be relieved and Wellington´s environmental quality would be improved. The result is increasing congestion and unhealthy air and noise pollution in Wellington. If Wellington wants to raise its status as a liveable city, it needs to follow the lead of cities such as Vancouver in Canada and Zurich that outperform Wellington in the liveablity city rankings. These cities assessed their performance of liveablity in the light of ‘balanced transport system planning´ approach proposed by Professor Vukan Vuchic (1999). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to apply Vuchic´s transport planning approach to carry out a document analysis reviewing the major transport and planning policies in the Wellington Region, identifying the current opportunities and constraints to achieving integration of land use and transport planning. In addition, constraints which are caused by the institutional characteristics of the government agencies will also be considered. This research finds that for Wellington to achieve success in the light of a balanced transport system planning approach; improved investment in software at Vuchic´s Level 1, 2 and 3. The investment in software should include improvement of coordination among different organisations, strengthening of public transport organisations and network planning for public transport development. Only small fixes improving the capability in transport planning institutions can help to integrate transport planning with land use in Wellington, which international evidence suggests, is more productive than single focus strategies on transport projects...|$|R

It then advocates an integrated “trip wire-speed bump” regime to reduce financial risk and, as a consequence, to reduce the frequency and depth of financial crises in developing countries.

It argues that EWS have failed because {{they are based on}} faulty theoretical assumptions, not least that the mere provision of information can reduce financial turbulence in developing countries. Second, the paper advances an approach to managing financial risks through trip wires and speed bumps. <b>Trip</b> wires are <b>indicators</b> of vulnerability that can illuminate the specific risks to which developing economies are exposed. Among the most significant of these vulnerabilities are the risk of large-scale currency depreciations, the risk that domestic and foreign investors and lenders may suddenly withdraw capital, the risk that locational and/or maturity mismatches will induce debt distress, the risk that non-transparent financial transactions will induce financial fragility, and the risk that a country will suffer the contagion effects of financial crises that originate elsewhere in the world or within particular sectors of their own economies. It argues that trip wires must be linked to policy responses that alter the context in which investors operate. In this connection, policymakers should link specific speed bumps that change behaviours to each type of trip wire. Third, the paper argues that the proposal for a trip wire-speed bump regime is not intended as a means to prevent all financial instability and crises in developing countries. Indeed, such a goal is fanciful. But insofar as developing countries remain highly vulnerable to financial instability, it is critical that policymakers vigorously pursue avenues for reducing the financial risks to which their economies are exposed and for curtailing the destabilizing effects of unpredictable changes in international private capital flows. Fourth, the paper responds to likely concerns about the response of investors, the IMF and powerful governments to the trip wire-speed bump approach. The paper also considers the issue of technical/institutional capacity to pursue this approach to policy. The paper concludes by arguing that the obstacles confronting the trip wire-speed bump approach are not insurmountable. ...|$|R
