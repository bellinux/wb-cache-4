50|$|This was one {{of several}} changes instituted {{beginning}} on June 30, 1975. On July 7, the show moved back one half-hour, but the new time slot brought much stronger competition in the form of Search for <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>on</b> <b>CBS</b> and ABC's All My Children, the latter already a big hit with younger audiences. The show was further hampered by a five-minute news program airing at 12:55, forcing Jackpot! to also shrink to 25 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} part of a block of daytime games on NBC during the early 1970s, which began with Concentration at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time and {{continued}} to Three on a Match at 1:30 p.m. Most of these games were known for emphasizing game play over prizes, which were intentionally small due to memories of the quiz show scandals of the 1950s. The Who, What, or Where Game ran at 12:30 p.m./11:30 a.m. Central, opposite Search for <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>on</b> <b>CBS,</b> and sitcom reruns, soap operas, and the games Password and Split Second on ABC. Because NBC ran a five-minute newscast anchored by either Floyd Kalber or Edwin Newman at 12:55 p.m. (before a 30-minute affiliate break), The Who, What, or Where Game only ran 25 minutes each day, instead of the customary 30. Similar to Jeopardy!, which preceded it at 12 Noon/11 a.m. Central, The Who, What, or Where Game proved to be an effective stablemate to its lead-in.|$|E

40|$|The {{correlations}} of {{primary and secondary}} structures were analyzed using proteins with known structure from Protein Data Bank. The correlation values of amino acid type and the eight secondary structure types at distant position were calculated for distances between - 25 and 25. Shapes of the diagrams indicate that amino acids polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distances. Clear preference {{of most of the}} amino acids towards certain secondary structure type classifies amino acids into four groups: alpha-helix admirers, strand admirers, turn and bend admirers and the others. Group four consists of His and Cis, the amino acids that do not show clear preference for any secondary structure. Amino acids from a group have similar physicochemical properties, and the same structural characteristics. The results suggest that amino acid preference for secondary structure type is based on the structural characteristics at Cb and Cg atoms of amino acid. alpha-helix admirers do not have polar heteroatoms <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> and Cg atoms, nor branching or aromatic group <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> atom. Amino acids that have aromatic groups or branching <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> atom are strand admirers. Turn and bend admirers have polar heteroatom <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> or Cg atoms or do not have Cb atom at all. Our results indicate that polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distance, and that amino acid preference for secondary structure is caused by structural properties at Cb or Cg atoms.
