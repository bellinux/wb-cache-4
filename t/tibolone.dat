25|$|A {{report in}} September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality {{suggests}} that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and <b>tibolone</b> {{used to treat}} breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also {{increase the risk of}} adverse side effects.|$|E
25|$|HRT is {{available}} in various forms. It generally provides low dosages {{of one or more}} estrogens, and often also provides either progesterone or a chemical analogue, called a progestin. Testosterone may also be included. Some HRT treatments such as Livial contain <b>Tibolone,</b> an anabolic steroid, that has the properties of oestrogen, progestogen and testosterone. Such treatments aren't usually recommended to women who are perimenopausal or for at least 12 months after the last menstrual period.|$|E
25|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} {{regression of}} fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because {{of the limitations}} and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink {{the size of the}} fibroids and uterus before surgery.

The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency.

30|$|Estrogens have neuroprotective properties. The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the impact of an isopropanolic extract of Cimicifuga racemosa (iCR), 17 ß-estradiol (E 2), {{testosterone}} (T) and <b>Tibolone’s</b> 3 α-OH metabolite (Org 4094) on local estrogen formation in hippocampus tissue from non-human primates ex vivo in vitro and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY 5 Y) in vitro.|$|R
30|$|We {{showed that}} in vitro local {{estrogen}} formation within brain cells and tissue was modulated by black cohosh (iCR), 17 ß-estradiol, testosterone, and <b>Tibolone’s</b> 3 α-OH metabolite, respectively. While short-term effects on STS activity were different for the compounds studied, the long-term effects in vitro were less pronounced being either inhibitory (E 2, T, Org 4094) or stimulating (iCR, E 2), respectively. The clinical implication of this finding has to be elucidated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tibolone</b> {{possesses}} a complex pharmacology. Its two major active metabolites, 3α-hydroxytibolone and 3β-hydroxytibolone, act as potent, fully activating agonists of the estrogen receptor (ER), {{with a high}} preference for ERα. <b>Tibolone</b> and its metabolite Δ4-tibolone act as agonists of the progesterone and androgen receptors, while 3α-hydroxytibolone and 3β-hydroxytibolone, conversely, act as antagonists of these receptors. Lastly, <b>tibolone,</b> 3α-hydroxytibolone, and 3β-hydroxytibolone act as antagonists of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, with preference for the mineralocorticoid receptor.|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{norethisterone}} {{has virtually}} no {{affinity for the}} estrogen receptors (ERs), noretynodrel shows some, albeit very weak affinity for both the ERα and the ERβ (in terms of relative binding affinity, 0.7% and 0.22% of that of estradiol, respectively). The estrogenic activity of 3α- and 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel has never been assessed. However, while <b>tibolone</b> shows similar affinity for the ERs as noretynodrel, the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of <b>tibolone</b> have several-fold increased affinity for the ERs. As such, the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of noretynodrel may also show increased estrogenic activity, and this {{may account for the}} known estrogenic effects of noretynodrel. The Δ4-isomer of <b>tibolone,</b> similarly to norethisterone, is virtually devoid of affinity for the ERs. Neither <b>tibolone</b> nor its metabolites are aromatized, whereas trestolone is readily aromatized similarly to testosterone and 19-nortestosterone, and for these reasons, it is unlikely that noretynodrel or its metabolites are aromatized either. As such, aromatization likely does not {{play a role in the}} estrogenic activity of <b>tibolone</b> or noretynodrel. However, controversy on this matter exists, and other researchers have suggested that <b>tibolone</b> and noretynodrel may be aromatized in small amounts to highly potent estrogens (ethinylestradiol and its 7α-methyl derivative, respectively).|$|E
30|$|The iCR (B. Nr. 010720) was {{provided}} by Schaper & Bruemmer GmbH & Co.KG. Salzgitter, Germany. The concentration of the extract was 100  mg/ml {{in relation to the}} dry residue.

30|$|To our knowledge, we are {{the first}} to report on the impact of black cohosh (iCR), 17 ß-estradiol (E 2), {{testosterone}} (T) and <b>Tibolone’s</b> 3 α-OH metabolite (Org 4049) on brain STS activity in proliferative human neuroblastoma cells in vitro and benign hippocampus tissue from non-human primates ex vivo in vitro. We found that 1) both, SH-SY 5 Y cells and hippocampus tissue, possessed the enzymes necessary (at least STS, 17 βHSD 1) to produce E 2 from E 1 S, 2) total estrogen formation (E 1 [*]+[*]E 2) was significantly higher in proliferative SH-SY 5 Y cells compared to benign hippocampus tissue, 3) iCR exerted a bidirectional action that was an immediate strong inhibitory effect followed by a stimulation of STS activity (85  % increase), 4) E 2 had a bidirectional dose-dependent long-term effect on STS activity (− 23  % reduction and 18  % increase) with the latter being less pronounced compared to iCR, 5) similar to iCR, T and Org 4094 had an immediate strong inhibitory effect on STS activity that was, however, further maintained with 24  h T treatment (30  % decrease), and 6) differences in treatment effects mainly occurred after “direct” incubation and were less pronounced in the long-term.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} the PR, {{noretynodrel}} possesses only about 6% to 19% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRA, whereas the affinity of the two drugs for the PRB is similar (noretynodrel possesses 94% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRB). <b>Tibolone</b> and the Δ4-isomer metabolite of <b>tibolone</b> have similar affinity for the PRs as noretynodrel and norethisterone, respectively, whereas the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of <b>tibolone</b> are virtually devoid of affinity for the PR. Since the structurally related anabolic-androgenic steroid trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) {{is known to be}} a potent progestogen, suggesting that a 7α-methyl substitution does not interfere with progestogenic activity, 3α- and 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel likely are devoid of affinity for the PR similarly to the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of <b>tibolone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tibolone</b> is {{also known}} {{chemically}} as 7α-methyl-17α-ethynyl-19-nor-δ5(10)-testosterone or as 7α-methyl-17α-ethynyl-17β-hydroxy-19-norandrost-5(10)-en-3-one, as well as 7α-methylnoretynodrel.|$|E
50|$|Noretynodrel is {{very closely}} related to {{norethisterone}} and <b>tibolone,</b> which are the Δ4-isomer and the 7α-methyl derivative of noretynodrel, respectively. Noretynodrel is metabolized in a very similar manner to <b>tibolone,</b> whereas the metabolism of norethisterone differs. Both noretynodrel and <b>tibolone</b> are transformed into 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites and a Δ4-isomer metabolite (in the case of noretynodrel, this being norethisterone), whereas norethisterone is not 3α- or 3β-hydroxylated (and of course does not form a Δ4-isomer metabolite). The major metabolites of noretynodrel are 3α-hydroxynoretynodrel {{and to a lesser}} extent 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel, formed by 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (AKR1C1-4), while the Δ4-isomer norethisterone is a minor metabolite formed in small amounts. <b>Tibolone</b> is considered to be a prodrug into both its 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated and Δ4-isomerized metabolites. Noretynodrel is also thought to be a prodrug, as it is rapidly metabolized and cleared from circulation (within 30 minutes) and shows very weak relative affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), although noretynodrel appears to form norethisterone in only minor quantities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tibolone</b> is a 19-nortestosterone {{derivative}} and {{is related}} structurally to other 19-nortestosterone progestins. It is the 7α-methyl derivative of noretynodrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tibolone</b> was {{developed}} in the 1960s. It was first introduced in the Netherlands in 1988, and was subsequently introduced in the United Kingdom in 1991.|$|E
50|$|Relative to norethisterone, {{noretynodrel}} has 45% to 81% reduced {{affinity for}} the androgen receptor (AR). In contrast to norethisterone (which is mildly androgenic), noretynodrel {{is said to have}} no or only very weak androgenic activity. In accordance, no androgenic effects (such as hirsutism, clitoral enlargement, or voice changes) have been observed with noretynodrel even when used in large dosages (e.g., 60 mg/day) for prolonged periods of time (9-12 months) in the treatment of women with endometriosis. Additionally, noretynodrel has not been found to virilize female fetuses, in contrast to many other testosterone-derived progestins including ethisterone, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate. However, according to Korn (1961), at least one case of pseudohermaphroditism (virilized genitalia) has been observed that may have been due to noretynodrel. The Δ4-isomer metabolite of <b>tibolone</b> shows dramatically and disproportionately increased {{affinity for the}} AR relative to norethisterone and noretynodrel (5.7- to 18.5-fold greater than that of norethisterone), indicating that the 7α-methyl group of <b>tibolone</b> markedly increases its androgenic activity and is responsible for the greater androgenic effects of <b>tibolone</b> relative to noretynodrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tibolone</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand name Livial, Tibofem), {{also known}} as 7α-methylnoretynodrel, is a {{synthetic}} steroid drug with estrogenic, progestogenic, and weak androgenic actions which was introduced in 1988 and is used widely in Europe, Asia, Australasia, and, {{with the exception of}} the United States (where it is not available), the rest of the world. It is used mainly for treatment of endometriosis, as well as hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women. <b>Tibolone</b> has similar or greater efficacy compared to older hormone replacement drugs, but shares a similar side effect profile. It has also been investigated as a possible treatment for female sexual dysfunction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tibolone</b> has tissue-selective estrogenic effects, with {{desirable}} {{effects in}} bone, the brain, and the vagina, {{and lack of}} undesirable action in the endometrium and breasts. Its tissue selectivity {{is the result of}} metabolism, enzyme modulation (e.g., of estrogen sulfatase and estrogen sulfotransferase), and receptor modulation that vary in different target tissues, and differs mechanistically from that of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen, which produce their tissue-selectivity via means of modulation of the ER. As such, to distinguish it from SERMs, <b>tibolone</b> {{has been described as a}} [...] "selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator" [...] (STEAR), and also as a [...] "selective estrogen enzyme modulator" [...] (SEEM).|$|E
50|$|A {{report in}} September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality {{suggests}} that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and <b>tibolone</b> {{used to treat}} breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also {{increase the risk of}} adverse side effects.|$|E

Such treatments aren't usually recommended to women who are perimenopausal or for at least 12 months after the last menstrual period.|$|E
50|$|A few progestins have weak estrogenic activity. These {{include the}} 19-nortestosterone {{derivatives}} norethisterone, noretynodrel, and <b>tibolone,</b> {{as well as}} the norethisterone prodrugs norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, and etynodiol diacetate. High dosages of norethisterone and noretynodrel have been associated with estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with alleviation of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, non-estrogenic progestins were not found to be associated with such effects.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, <b>tibolone,</b> normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
5000|$|A {{report in}} September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality {{suggests}} that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and <b>tibolone</b> {{used to treat}} breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also {{increase the risk of}} adverse side effects. Some cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been {{associated with the use of}} tamoxifen, due to the blood clots and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that can be caused by this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.|$|E
50|$|It is {{well known}} that post-menopausal women who have not had a {{hysterectomy}} are at increased risk of cancer of the endometrium (the lining of the womb) if they take estrogen-only HRT. Follow up of over 700 000 women in the Million Women Study confirmed this and showed that the risk of endometrial cancer is also increased in women who take tibolone; but is not altered, or may even be reduced, in women taking combined estrogen-progestogen HRT. These effects depend also on a woman’s body mass index (BMI, a measure of obesity) such that adverse effects of <b>tibolone</b> and estrogen-only HRT are greatest in thinner women, and the beneficial effects of combined HRT are greatest in fatter women.|$|E
50|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} {{regression of}} fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels.

Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, <b>tibolone,</b> raloxifene, progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.|$|E
50|$|Noretynodrel is an estrane (C18) steroid and is {{also known}} {{chemically}} as 17α-ethynyl-δ5(10)-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynylestr-5(10)-en-17β-ol-3-one, as well as 17α-ethynyl-19-nor-5(10)-testosterone or 5(10)-norethisterone. It is a derivative of testosterone that has been ethynylated at the C17α position, demethylated at the C19 position, and dehydrogenated (i.e., has a double bond) between the C5 and C10 positions. As such, noretynodrel is also a combined derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone). In addition, it is an isomer of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) in which the C4 double bond has been replaced with a double bond between the C5 and C10 positions. For this reason, noretynodrel {{is also known as}} 5(10)-norethisterone. Few other 19-nortestosterone progestins share the C5(10) double bond of noretynodrel, but an example of one that does is <b>tibolone,</b> the 7α-methyl derivative of noretynodrel (i.e., 7α-methylnoretynodrel).|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} {{done by the}} Million Women Study, funded by Cancer Research UK has proven that certain forms of HRT {{increase the risk of}} endometrial (womb) cancer. However, previous research has shown that the combined type of HRT poses a greater breast cancer risk than <b>tibolone</b> or oestrogen (estradiol)-only HRT and, because breast cancer is more common than endometrial cancer, the researchers believe that when considering the overall effect of HRT it is important to look at both breast and endometrial cancer. However, this study was conducted using oral estradiol instead of transdermal estradiol which avoids the risks which the study highlights. Again, this shows that the combined estrogen patch (such as Evorel® Conti) or gel (ESTROGEL PROPAK™ - 17ß-estradiol and micronized progesterone) is the preferable treatment choice.|$|E
50|$|Results of {{the study}} show a small {{increase}} in risk of ovarian cancer in women taking HRT. Such an increased risk had been suspected from some previous studies, and has now been confirmed with the larger numbers available in this study. The findings come from analyses on 948,576 post-menopausal women in the study, followed up for about 5 years. Women currently taking HRT were at higher risk of developing and of dying from ovarian cancer than women not using HRT. Past users were not at increased risk. The risk in current users was increased about 1.2 fold; for every 1000 women using HRT, 2.6 developed ovarian cancer over 5 years, compared with 2.2 in those not taking HRT. The risk was the same for estrogen-only, combined estrogen-progestogen {{and other types of}} HRT (including <b>tibolone)</b> and did not vary by specific type of estrogen or progestogen, or between oral and transdermal (patch) administration.|$|E
50|$|The {{maintenance}} and {{improvement of quality}} of life during the menopausal period {{is at the core}} of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called <b>tibolone</b> — a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties — suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E
40|$|Hormone {{treatment}} with an estrogen plus a progestagen {{increases the risk}} of breast cancer. Both hormone activities reside also in <b>tibolone.</b> In order to assess the breast safety of <b>tibolone</b> the compound was evaluated in various preclinical models. In breast cancer cell lines the effects of <b>tibolone</b> were inconclusive, but in various in vivo models it did not stimulate the breast. In the DMBA model <b>tibolone</b> clearly inhibited the growth of breast tumors and when <b>tibolone</b> is given in a prophylactic design far less tumors develop. Ovariectomized monkeys treated for two years with <b>tibolone</b> show no increase in the expression of the proliferation marker Ki 67. Several investigations were performed in order to unravel the mode of action of <b>tibolone</b> in breast tissue. The effects of <b>tibolone</b> and its metabolites on the various steroid metabolizing enzymes in breast tissues were therefore investigated. <b>Tibolone</b> or its metabolites did not inhibit the enzyme aromatase, but sulfatase was profoundly inhibited. The sulfated 3 alpha-OH <b>tibolone</b> metabolite showed even irreversible inhibition of the sulfatase enzyme. In addition, {{it was found that the}} enzyme 17 beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase activity was also slightly inhibited and sulfotransferase activity was stimulated at low concentrations. The consequence of the effects of <b>tibolone</b> on these enzymes is that for both the endogenous estrogens and the estrogenic metabolites of <b>tibolone</b> the equilibrium is preferentially at the site of the sulfated forms. Besides this effect on the intracellular hormonal milieu <b>tibolone</b> and its metabolites also influence cellular homeostasis. It inhibits cell proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells and stimulates apoptosis. In this respect, <b>tibolone</b> behaves differently to estrogens. Clinical studies have shown that <b>tibolone</b> users experience less breast tenderness and do not show an increase in mammographic density as found with continuous combined estrogen plus progestagen preparations. The data about <b>tibolone</b> and breast cancer risk are inconclusive and require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} effects of 3 months' <b>tibolone</b> {{treatment}} with {{the effects of}} placebo on sexual function (in particular, vaginal blood flow, and sexual desire and arousability) and climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was conducted in 38 postmenopausal women who received <b>tibolone</b> 2. 5 mg/day and placebo. Vaginal blood flow during erotic stimulation by fantasy and film was measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph and subjects completed sexual function questionnaires and daily diaries. RESULTS: <b>Tibolone</b> significantly increased baseline vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) levels compared with placebo. There were significant treatment differences in VPA in favor of <b>tibolone</b> during fantasy periods but not during erotic film stimulation. <b>Tibolone</b> was associated with significant increases in sexual desire, and the frequency of arousability and of sexual fantasies compared with those with placebo.
