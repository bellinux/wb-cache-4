5|$|Years later, Bennett would {{recall his}} dismay at {{being asked to}} do {{contemporary}} material, comparing it to when his mother was forced to produce a cheap dress. By 1972, he had departed Columbia for the Verve division of MGM Records (Philips in the UK) and had relocated for a stint in London, where he hosted a television show from <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town nightclub in conjunction with Thames Television, Tony Bennett at <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town. With his new label, he tried a variety of approaches, including some more Beatles material, but found no renewed commercial success, and in a couple more years he was without a recording contract.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rose Room {{was removed}} from the Algonquin in a 1998 remodel, the hotel paid tribute to the group by {{commissioning}} and hanging the painting A Vicious Circle by Natalie Ascencios, depicting the Round Table and also created a replica of the original table.

5|$|The {{treasure}} {{weighed in}} at over 34 tons, or £205,536. Almost a quarter went to Albemarle. Phips, after paying out £8,000 in crew shares, received £11,000. Phips {{was treated as}} a hero in London, and the find was <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town.

5|$|One of these, <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, was {{the first}} three-time World Grand Champion. Midnight Sun was also great-grandsire of I Am Jose, the second three-time winner. Most of the leading Tennessee Walker sires {{in recent years have}} {{themselves}} been descendants of Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI). Through his offspring, he has also influenced the Racking Horse and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds. For many years, a life-size statue of Midnight Sun, commissioned after his death by his former owner Geraldine Livingston, stood at the TWHBEA headquarters in Lewisburg, Tennessee.|$|E

60|$|And <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world {{found its}} way down to that respectable country parsonage in which Lady Dumbello had been born, and from which she had been taken away to those noble halls which she now graced by her presence. <b>The</b> <b>talking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world was heard at Plumstead Episcopi, where still lived Archdeacon Grantly, the lady's father; and was heard also at <b>the</b> deanery <b>of</b> Barchester, where lived the lady's aunt and grandfather.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town is Norman Tebbit's vulgar grand-standing barn-storming {{performance}} on Europe.

Also that year, her album Something was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from traditional pop to more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by The Beatles) – although Bassey would never completely abandon what that had been her forte: standards, show tunes, and torch songs.|$|E

25|$|Local gossips noticed Wright's flirtations, and he {{developed}} a reputation in Oak Park as a man-about-town. His family had grown to six children, but Wright was not parental and he relied on his wife Catherine to care for them. In 1903, Wright designed a house for Edwin Cheney, a neighbor in Oak Park, and immediately took a liking to Cheney's wife, Mamah. Mamah Cheney was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. The two fell in love, and they became <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, as they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. Wright's wife, Kitty, sure that this attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce.
