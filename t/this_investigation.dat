5|$|McCarthy's {{committee}} {{then began}} {{an investigation into}} the United States Army. This began at the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but ultimately nothing came of <b>this</b> <b>investigation.</b> McCarthy next {{turned his attention to the}} case of a U.S. Army dentist who had been promoted to the rank of major despite having refused to answer questions on an Army loyalty review form. McCarthy's handling of <b>this</b> <b>investigation,</b> including a series of insults directed at a brigadier general, led to the Army-McCarthy hearings, with the Army and McCarthy trading charges and counter-charges for 36 days before a nationwide television audience. While the official outcome of the hearings was inconclusive, this exposure of McCarthy to the American public resulted in a sharp decline in his popularity. In less than a year, McCarthy was censured by the Senate and his position as a prominent force in anti-communism was essentially ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Technicolor Corporation {{contracted}} with SRI {{to develop a}} near-instantaneous, electro-optical alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design {{and development of the}} Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. <b>This</b> <b>investigation</b> led to William K.

5|$|In May 1934, {{following}} {{reports of}} a Japanese spy operating out of Dutch Harbor, the United States Navy dispatched Edwin T. Layton to the Aleutians to investigate the allegations. The result of <b>this</b> <b>investigation</b> was the arrest of the only Japanese man in the region, {{as well as the}} town's only prostitute, a woman accused of conspiring with the Japanese man. During the 1930s, a number of United States governmental committees, boards and reports concluded that air bases in the Aleutians would be for the most part impractical due to the region's inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. <b>This</b> <b>investigation</b> is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} Berquist's motives, noting {{that she was}} the reason Mulder decided to look into <b>this</b> <b>investigation.</b> Mulder, however, begins to suspect Detweiler after learning that he had been at the vet's office; Mulder believes that he is the dhole and is tranquilizing himself in an attempt to stop murdering. Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the Dhole and placed in the hospital. Mulder then visits Berquist and says he thinks she has not been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler when she saw him. She also says that he will try to finish off Cahn. Mulder worriedly tells Scully, who remains skeptical.|$|E
