Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E

[...] Before accepting the settlement, the two families had asked for face-to-face apologies from the USN and Waddle, a full investigation into the collision, a reasonable compensation offer, and a promise from the USN to help prevent similar accidents in the future.

500|$|Leicester's forces, {{small and}} seriously underfinanced from the outset, faced the most {{formidable}} army in Europe. Unity among their ranks was at risk by Leicester's and the other officers' quarrels with Sir John Norris, who had commanded previous English contingents in the Netherlands and was now the Earl's deputy. Elizabeth was angry that the war cost more than anticipated and for many months delayed sending money and troops. This not only forced Dudley to raise further funds on his own account, but much aggravated the soldiers' lot. [...] "They cannot get a penny; their credit is spent; they perish for want of victuals and clothing in great numbers ...

Eventually, the producers tweaked the script, adding [...] "the reality of The X-Filess existing mythos and past character development" [...] to ease the transition. Davis later noted, [...] "I was basically {{happy with the way}} [...] turned out, despite {{the fact that there were}} many other ideas that I had that I did not get <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>My</b> original conception of the story was that Cigarette-Smoking Man was a much better actor at winning Scully's affections and that Scully was less resistant to this attention to her."

500|$|In 2007, Total Film named Nolan the 32nd {{greatest}} {{director of}} all time, and in 2012, The Guardian ranked him # 14 {{on their list}} of [...] "The 23 Best Film Directors in the World" [...] In 2013, a survey of 17 film academics showed that Nolan {{was among the most}} studied directors in Britain. Nolan's work has also been recognised as an influence on video games. Renowned video game designer Hideo Kojima compared Dunkirk to his own work: [...] "Its approach to technology in movie making and refusal to rely on defeating one's enemies as a portrayal of war, reminds me in many ways of my work on Metal Gear and where I hope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> next game go". In 2015, Time featured Nolan as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.|$|E
500|$|Kesha was {{inspired}} to write the song after continual rejection from the protagonist in the song, Stephen, who refused to call the singer.

[...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> show at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain.

500|$|His {{father died}} in June 1912, which, {{according}} to Șerban Cioculescu (who cited Mateiu's correspondence), left him indifferent. By then, Caragiale-son resented Ion Luca's alleged exploitation of his popularity for material gains, and, later in the same year, commented that, [...] "for a small fee", Caragiale-father could be persuaded to read his works at the fair in Obor. In a since-lost piece of his diary that was commented upon by Cioculescu, he also claimed that binge drinking and tobacco abuse had made his father decay physically and mentally. Despite his love for Berlin, he was also dissatisfied with his father's move to the city, and spread the rumor that, {{in the eyes of}} his family and friends, Ion Luca's departure was interpreted as [...] "insane" [...] (while alleging that Caragiale-father was planning to author plays in German, with assistance from Mite Kremnitz, the one-time lover of poet Mihai Eminescu). At the funeral ceremony, he reputedly shocked pianist Cella Delavrancea by coldly stating in French: Je suis venu voir feu mon père ("I came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> late father").|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} by the Liberals involved PedroI's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation {{was in the}} hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. PedroI also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: [...] "It grieves me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that my blood is the same color as that of the Negroes." ...|$|E

500|$|Milian {{described}} So Amazin as a [...] "consistent, {{very real}} and personal album". A problem Milian had with her previous album, It's About Time, was {{that it did not}} flow.

Wanting a more consistent approach for her new album, Milian collaborated with only one team of producers, which made for a greater representation of a [...] "more mature, settled" [...] Milian. The purpose of the album was to record an album that had more realness, so that female fans could relate to what she was singing about. Milian felt that Cool & Dre brought their own style of beats to the album, giving it a [...] "raw feel" [...] and [...] "street credibility". Marcello [...] "Cool" [...] Valenzano of Cool & Dre said that [...] "we come from an R background, and we bringing [...] something new to the table, a style we think is hot." [...] For So Amazin, Milian knew that she needed to record material that had a [...] "realness". She wanted to make dance tracks, but also wanted to express more of herself at the same time. Milian found the album to be [...] "so much more real and urban and street" [...] than her previous albums.|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E
