5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> were being let {{down by the}} education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E

A review in the Surabaya edition of De Indische Courant, however, indicates that the film had only premiered in the east Javan city on 14 January 1942. That newspaper gave a positive review, describing Soeara Berbisa as a tense film with humorous moments and beautiful scenery. Its review ended with a recommendation <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and their parents see the film.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a decline of hunting {{partially}} {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> lack the skills to survive off the land. They are no longer skilled in hunting like their ancestors and are growing more accustomed to the Qallunaat ("white people") food that they receive from the south. The high costs of hunting equipment—snowmobiles, rifles, sleds, camping gear, gasoline, and oil—is also causing a decline in families who hunt for their meals.|$|E

25|$|Another study {{conducted}} in 2004 examined {{the level of}} response to alcohol and brain response during visual working memory.

The results were <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> who report having needed more alcohol to feel the effects showed higher levels of brain response during visual working memory, this suggests that the individual’s capacity to adjust to cognitive processing decreases, they are less able to adjust cognitive processing to contextual demands.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the question of}} <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations in agriculture {{in light of the}} renewed interest in the agricultural sector as a viable basis for development in sub?Saharan Africa (SSA), and the perception <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> involvement is important for the success of this project. Life choices and outcomes are affected in part by aspirations. The nature and formation of <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations therefore have direct implications for emerging visions and future models of agriculture to the extent <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations inform the decisions they make in relation to agriculture. The article takes issue with essentialising policy narratives about rural youth in agricultural areas that obscure the diversity that exists within that group. We need to investigate such diversity and its significance for <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations. Using the case of the cocoa sub?sector in Ghana, we analyse how the differences in <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> backgrounds and experiences with cocoa influences their expectations of the role of cocoa farming in their future...|$|R

Since dreams were usually prophetic, this {{depressed}} him, so his mother Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except mistletoe—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.|$|E
25|$|Young was {{instrumental}} in officially legalizing slavery in Utah Territory, teaching that the doctrine of slavery {{was connected to the}} priesthood ban. Slavery in Utah ended in 1862 when Congress abolished it. Blacks gained the right to vote in 1867, also through an act of Congress. Young and other church leaders were against interracial marriage. Utah's anti-miscegenation law was repealed in 1963. There has never been a written church policy against interracial marriage. Church publications from 2003 still recommended <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> marry those with similar racial backgrounds. Black people in the LDS Church suffered exclusion and discrimination even after the 1978 revelation, and still feel the effects of racist attitudes.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that 66% of social media users {{actively}} engage in political activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones. With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> who are politically active online are double as likely to vote {{than those who are}} not politically active online. Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites. Social media is therefore a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns.|$|E

25|$|In Italy it {{is called}} Calendimaggio or cantar maggio a {{seasonal}} feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring. The event {{takes its name from}} the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin calenda maia. The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna (for example, is celebrated {{in the area of the}} Quattro Province or Piacenza, Pavia, Alessandria and Genoa), Tuscany and Umbria. This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an almsgiving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit. Throughout the Italian peninsula these Il Maggio couplets are very diverse—most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> sang to celebrate the arrival of spring. Symbols of spring revival are the trees (alder, golden rain) and flowers (violets, roses), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves. In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that's why it is often present in the ritual.|$|E

500|$|Publicity over The Well of Lonelinesss {{legal battles}} {{increased}} {{the visibility of}} lesbians in British and American culture.

Some readers have valued it, while others have criticised it for Stephen's expressions of self-hatred, and viewed it as inspiring shame. Its role in promoting images of lesbians as [...] "mannish" [...] or cross-dressed women has also been controversial. Although critics differ as to the value of The Well of Loneliness as a work of literature, its treatment of sexuality and gender continues to inspire study and debate.|$|E
500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969.

Animator Ollie Johnston recalled <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> [...] "thought we were on a trip when we made it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on."
