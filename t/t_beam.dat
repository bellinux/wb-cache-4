40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} {{the application of the}} spatial system of finite element modeling for the vehicle-bridge interaction on reinforced concrete US Girder Bridge in order to obtain the effect of surface roughness. Single vehicle and multiple vehicles on reinforced concrete <b>T</b> <b>beam</b> bridge were studied with variable surface roughness profiles. The effects of six different surface roughness profiles (very good, good, measured, average, poor, and very poor) were investigated for vehicle-bridge interaction. The values of the Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) were obtained for single and multiple vehicles on <b>T</b> <b>Beam</b> Bridge for different surface roughness profiles, along with the distances between the axles of heavy vehicle. It was observed that when the bridge has very good, good, measured, and average surface roughness, the DAF values for the single vehicle over the bridge were observed to be within acceptable limits specified by AASHTO. However, for the bridge with multiple vehicles only very good and measured surface roughness profiles showed a DAF and vehicle axle distances within the acceptable limits. From the current studies, it was observed that the spatial system showed reliable responses for predicting the behavior of the bridge under variable road surface roughness conditions and was reliable in vehicle axle detection, and therefore, it has a potential to be use for realistic simulations...|$|E

40|$|CLIC is an {{international}} study of a future multi-TeV electron-positron linear collider, where the energy of a high-intensity drive beam is extracted and transferred to the main beam via Power Extraction and Transfer Structures (PETS) {{in the form of}} rf power. The study of power production is therefore essential for the feasibility of CLIC. Power production in PETS has been studied, and ex- periments have been performed in the decelerator <b>Test</b> <b>Beam</b> Line in the CLIC Test Facility 3. In particular, the correlation of the power production and the beam position inside the structure has been studied. It is shown that the total produced power is constant when the beam has a position offset through the PETS. In addition, the difference between the measured phases from each side is independent of the beam position, which allows for efficient combination of the fields. However, the ratio of the power {{on each side of the}} PETS unexpectedly shows a linear dependence on the horizontal offset, with a correlation value of 0. 87. This can potentially affect the power transferred to the main linac, and should be taken into account in the design of the high power rf system.

The current trend is toward the creative use of composites to delay these instabilities. To obtain an optimum de-sign, an accurate as well as e–cient model is required. As a flrst step towards this goal, aeroelastic analysis is carried out for a swept composite box beam, using a linear structural model and a linear 2 -D unsteady aero-dynamic theory. Structurally, the wing is modeled as a thin-walled composite box beam of rectangular cross section. Theodorsen’s theory is used to get the 2 -D un-steady aerodynamic forces, which are integrated over the span. The °utter solution is obtained using the V-g method and divergence speeds are calculated by using a very low reduced frequency in the °utter analysis.

Within the shock, the model electron distribution function possesses a field-aligned T greater than <b>T</b> <b>beam</b> that is directed toward the magnetosheath. Waves with frequencies between about 1 and 100 Hz {{with a wide range}} of wave normal angles are generated by the beam via Landau and anomalous cyclotron resonances.

The ray paths for most of these waves are directed toward the solar wind although some wave packets, due to plasma convection travel transverse to the shock normal. These wave packets grow to large amplitudes because they spend a long time in the growth region.
