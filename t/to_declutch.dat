5000|$|Neither Bugatti's U-16 or the King-Bugatti were {{particularly}} successful engines. Few were installed in aircraft, {{and even fewer}} actually flew. After World War I no further developments {{were made in the}} US, while in France Breguet took over the license and continued development under the designation [...] "Type U-24".

5000|$|... (TMS) which {{contains}} two ECU's the {{transmission control unit}} (TECU) and the gear selector control unit (GECU). I-Shift borrowed from old transmission technologies like non-synchronised main gears which allowed a reduction in size and weight and a countershaft brake to achieve more precise shift control while matching engine rpm to transmissions rpm e.g. TECU requests the EECU to correct engine rpm so as to synchronise the rpm to effect a smooth gear change, similar <b>to</b> double <b>declutching.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "I used to {{love the}} old cars," [...] {{explained}} Robert Hardy. [...] "Except when they gave up. They were always giving up. We had a permanent mechanic up there {{and he was always}} deep inside the bonnet of this or that car. But I had some nice cars to drive, and when they worked they were great fun. And, of course, I was old enough to remember how <b>to</b> double <b>declutch</b> and all that sort of thing, so they weren't a shock to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1920 Mr Ashton-Evans {{decided to}} find out what his {{customers}} wanted in an [...] "owner driver's ideal" [...] car and invited opinions. From the response he worked out that the car should have a four-cylinder water cooled engine not exceeding 12 taxable hp and be silent, vibrationless, easy to start and powerful. Gear changing should be silent and without the need <b>to</b> double <b>declutch.</b> There should be room for three people on the front seat. To meet this specification J Bedford designed a new car which became the Ashton 10.5 model, the Ashton-Evans name being temporarily dropped. This had a normal rear axle. Most cars featured -litre, 4-cylinder Coventry Simplex engines and three-speed constant-mesh gearboxes with selection made by dog clutches. Some of the early cars might have had two-cylinder engines. Two- and four-seat open bodies were available.|$|R
