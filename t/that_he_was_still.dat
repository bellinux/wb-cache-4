5|$|For the 1996 championship, Canavan {{was handed}} the {{captaincy}} of Tyrone, and was Ulster's leading scorer {{for the third}} year in a row, and subsequently awarded his third successive All Star. Tyrone reached the All-Ireland semi-final against Meath, but Canavan was one of six Tyrone players to sustain injuries that day, which some Tyrone fans attribute to Meath's heavy-handedness. Canavan's injury was so severe <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> feeling the effects for over a year, and there was speculation as to whether he had been playing on a broken foot.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{made his}} track return in Beijing but his injury had reduced his 100m medal chances and Bolt and Powell were more {{favored to win}} the event. The much {{anticipated}} Gay, Bolt and Powell final never materialised, however, as Gay failed to qualify in the semi-finals. Finishing fifth after recording 10.05s, Gay denied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> injured, but claimed the hamstring problem had upset his training schedule.|$|E
5|$|Hannah Beswick {{was born}} in 1688, the {{daughter}} of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.|$|E

5|$|Juan Leyrado {{played a}} {{grandfather}} {{for the first}} time in his career. Unlike the usual telenovela grandfather (a secondary character), his character has a prominent role and his own story arcs. Leyrado, who was 60 years old when the series was made, said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> active in his personal life and played the character according to his own experiences. Korean-Argentine Chang Kim Sung, who played Walter Mao, said he was proud that his character did not conform to stereotypes of Asian people.|$|E
5|$|Milne's form at Bristol City {{was enough}} to {{convince}} Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> worth a contract with a top-flight club. In November 1988 he moved to Old Trafford in a £170,000 deal. Ferguson was looking to build a title winning side two years after joining United, but had seen his side finish second in the league the previous season {{and now they were}} on a winless run in the league that saw them mid-table. He put Milne on the left-wing as Gordon Strachan was already established on the right-wing.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{eventually}} {{decided the}} Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He {{had done what}} many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also knew <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, {{with no more than}} two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E

5|$|The film {{ran into}} {{production}} trouble in mid 2010 and {{was close to}} being shelved, with sources reporting that Thiagarajan sold the film to Santiago Martin to revive the project. The reports proved to be untrue, and Thiagarajan maintained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> the producer of the film. The film had also begun to surpass its budget, due to the casual nature of shooting and difficulties in creating historical sets. The first shots from the film and the video for three songs were unveiled publicly in March2011, with the publicity campaign initiated after this.|$|E
5|$|These benefices {{provided}} an income without {{the obligation to}} perform any pastoral services. Their revenues were assigned {{to pay for his}} studies, leaving poorly paid vicars to carry out the pastoral work. Walter remained as a teacher and official at Orléans, perhaps without returning to Scotland at all, until the late 1350s, by when he would have been absent from his native country for more than 25years. In an Aberdeen document dated 12 July 1356, it was noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> absent from his post.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Clark and Michael Jon Carter (Booster Gold) {{inadvertently}} {{traveled to}} the 31st century, where they found themselves caught in a war between New Krypton, led by Kara, and an army of xenophobes, during which Doomsday is reawakened, then defeated when all the belligerents form an alliance. While in the future, Clark met a child named Bartholomew Allen, causing Clark to suspect he was a descendant of Bart and giving him hope <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive. After meeting Diana Prince, with whom he teamed to defeat Hades and Felix Faust, Clark, as Superman, chose to reveal to the President {{that he was not}} a meteor-infected individual as the public believed but was from another planet. Later, Clark attempted to rally the heroes and the world to make a stand against the Monitors.|$|E

5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In his office, Dumbledore {{explains}} that Snape had understood Harry's cryptic warning, and had subsequently contacted Sirius, learning <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> at Grimmauld Place. After Harry failed {{to return from}} the Forbidden Forest, Snape deduced where he had gone and alerted the Order of the Phoenix, allowing them to save Harry and his friends. It is revealed that during the Christmas holidays, Kreacher had interpreted a command of Sirius's as an order to leave the house, and went to Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius, and told them about Harry and Sirius's close relationship; Voldemort subsequently realised that he could lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries by tricking him into thinking that Sirius was in danger there.|$|E

He previously owned a penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Trump World Tower. Regarding his official residence, Jeter settled a tax {{dispute with the}} New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in 2008. New York State alleged that Jeter should have paid state income tax from 2001 to 2003, as Jeter resided in the Manhattan apartment he bought in 2001; Jeter claimed to have established his residence in Tampa, Florida, in 1994 and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a resident of Florida at the time. Florida has no state income tax.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford {{had told him}} that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that that made his position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he had}} been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier {{had told him that}} if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E
5|$|On the June 30 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers {{for a new}} top-tier SmackDown! {{championship}} was held. JBL, one of the participants, was victorious in the match, but Theodore Long announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> not the champion. Instead he had {{won the right to}} a match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL at The Great American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. At the Great American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.|$|E

Itoi stated that an additional two years would have been required to finish the game, which was 30% complete at the time of cancellation. Iwata stated retrospectively that the focus on 3D graphics made the project overly complex. Miyamoto also stated that the Mother franchise was not abandoned and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> interested in bringing the game to fruition.|$|E
5|$|The {{complications}} kept Ebert {{off the air}} for {{an extended}} period of time. Ebert made his first public appearance since mid-2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> unable to speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc. In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Ebert later proposed a test to determine the realism of a synthesized voice.|$|E
5|$|During the First Indochina War, Thảo was a {{communist}} {{officer in the}} Vietminh and helped oversee various operations in the Mekong Delta in the far south, at one point commanding his future enemy Nguyễn Khánh, who briefly served the communist cause. After the French withdrawal and the partition of Vietnam, Thảo stayed {{in the south and}} made a show of renouncing communism. He became part of the military establishment in the anti-communist southern regime and quickly rose through the ranks. Nominally Catholic, Thảo befriended Diệm's elder brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục—the devoutly Roman Catholic Ngô family strongly favored co-religionists and had great trust in Thảo, unaware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> loyal to the communists. He went on to serve as the chief of Bến Tre Province, and gained fame after the area—traditionally {{a communist}} stronghold—suddenly became peaceful and prosperous. Vietnamese and US officials, as well as journalists hostile to or supportive of Saigon, misinterpreted this as a testament to Thảo's great ability, and he was promoted to a more powerful position where he could further his sabotage. Thảo and the communists in the local area had simply stopped fighting, so that the communists could quietly recuperate, while Thảo would appear to be very skillful and be given a more important job where he could do more damage.|$|E
