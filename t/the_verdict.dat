40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{investigate}} the variation between coroners in <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> given to deaths thought by researchers to be probable suicides and analyse {{factors associated with}} <b>the</b> coroners' <b>verdict.</b> METHODS: Data were collected from 12 English coroner districts on all deaths in 2005 given a suicide, open, accidental or narrative verdict where suicide was considered a possibility. The data were reviewed by three experienced suicide researchers. Regression models were used to investigate factors associated with <b>the</b> coroners' <b>verdict.</b> RESULTS: <b>The</b> researchers classified 593 deaths as suicide, of which 385 (65. 4 %) received a suicide <b>verdict</b> from <b>the</b> coroner. There was marked variation between coroner districts in <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> they gave. <b>The</b> suicide method was associated strongly with the coroners' verdict; deaths from poisoning and drowning were {{the least likely to}} be given suicide <b>verdicts.</b> <b>The</b> other factors strongly associated with a coroner's verdict of suicide were: whether a note was left, age over 60 years and being married or widowed compared with being single. CONCLUSION: Coroners vary considerably in <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> they give to individuals who probably died by suicide. This may compromise the usefulness of suicide statistics for assessing area differences in rates for public health surveillance...|$|R
