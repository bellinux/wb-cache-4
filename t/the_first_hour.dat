5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of the day three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour.</b> Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
5|$|English captain Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat.

Johnson was only given five overs and took 0/19 as the pacemen efficiently cut down the English batsmen in 79 overs.|$|E

These numbers excluded viewership from locations such as bars and New Year's Eve parties, as Nielsen ratings do not account for out-of-home viewership (however, the company announced on October 24, 2016 that it would begin to offer out-of-home ratings data to broadcasters in April 2017).|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} opening ceremony, United States {{broadcaster}} NBC was criticised for its coverage, as omitting performers less-known in the US. John Clarke, writing for Forbes, said it was wrong not to air performances from Ray Davies and Muse, as well as delaying the performance from The Who by an hour to broadcast the pilot of the sitcom Animal Practice followed by the late local news. While in New Zealand, Prime TV were also criticised for delayed coverage, running 20 minutes behind Sky Sport. In the Philippines, TV5 was also criticised because it only aired <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of coverage of the ceremony and highlights were incorporated into its morning news programme, Good Morning Club.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, {{including}} eight innings victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour.</b> The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day. The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{initially}} {{struggled against}} the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling {{from the other}} end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first 20 minutes and Australia had scored only 14 after the first 30 minutes. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia {{elected to}} bat first and England made an ideal start. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling and removed Barnes for a duck {{in his second}} over to leave the {{tourists}} at 1/3. England restricted the Australians in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> and created several near misses, particularly against Bradman, who nervous early on. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scored many runs from the back cut. At {{the end of the}} pace bowlers' opening spells, the leg spin of Doug Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched over the leg side fence for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated steadily, although the latter was able to extract substantial spin, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman on 35.|$|E
5|$|Miller had a lean Third Test, taking {{only one}} wicket and scoring four and 35, as Australia lost by six wickets. In the Fourth Test at the MCG, the West Indies batted first and Miller removed both openers in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour,</b> before {{returning}} to end with 5/60 as the tourists were bowled out for 272. He then scored 47 as Australia managed only 216. He took 2/49, but only scored two in Australia's run-chase of 259. The home team won by one wicket. In the Fifth Test, Miller took 5/26 in the first innings with another concentrated display of short-pitched bowling, and then scored 69 in the second innings. He took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia fell short of their target. Miller ended the series as the leading bowler, with 20wickets at 19.90. He was second in the batting, with 362runs at 40.22. Throughout the series, Miller and Lindwall were repeatedly successful with their concerted bouncer tactics, which were heavily criticised.|$|E

5|$|Miller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in {{the first}} innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest {{he came to a}} catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the half-volley. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The run rate picked up in the last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour.</b> Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before Dick Pollard trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.|$|E
5|$|The film made back {{most of its}} {{production}} and promotions budget the day it opened, grossing close to $6,000 in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>hour,</b> and nearly $25,000 during its first week, landing it on Varietys list of the week's 50 top-grossing films. Positive word of mouth spread and the film was favorably reviewed in Variety ("There are no more closets!"), The Advocate ("Everyone will {{fall in love with}} this philandering fellator.") and other outlets, which previously had completely ignored the genre. While some critics were less impressed, others saw the film as akin to the avant-garde work of directors like Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol. Within six months the film had grossed $140,000 and was continuing to open in theatres across the United States and around the world.|$|E
