5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram as their primary weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was mounted on a turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> upper deck.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{found himself}} {{at the heart of}} the battle for the island before the {{squadron}} arrived. On 27 November the convoy came under attack from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship. He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> ships. Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into the water out of fuel. The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone <b>to</b> <b>damage.</b> <b>The</b> result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E

5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E

The symptoms can include numbness, tingling, pain, and altered pain sensation, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin. Diabetes-related foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcers) may occur, and can be difficult to treat, occasionally requiring amputation.

In the winter of 1900–01, for example, disputes between the Pike and North Lake Company and its rival the Wisconsin Lakes Ice and Cartage Company over the rights to harvest ice resulted in pitched battles between workers and the deployment of a steamship icebreaker to smash competing supplies.|$|E
5|$|When World War II began, Bruno Heinemann was {{initially}} {{deployed in the}} Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods and was also briefly refitted during this time. After completing her refit, Bruno Heinemann and Paul Jakobi were bound for the Baltic via the Kiel Canal when they were attacked by 11 Handley Page Hampden bombers of No. 144 Squadron RAF on 29 September. The British aircraft failed <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> German ships and five were shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters.|$|E

Neto begs his parents to take him with them and they refuse. Days later, Neto tries to escape but is captured and receives electric shock treatment. Suddenly, in another day, his father visits him to say he and Meire are missing him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto {{if he wants to}} return to school or to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client {{in the midst of a}} sale.

At 08:00 {{on the morning of}} 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to open fire, a few long range shots failing <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. The gunfire attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> mask by putting it on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|In Hawaiian mythology, {{the peaks}} of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only {{high-ranking}} aliʻi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living {{on the slopes of}} Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> mountain's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–ōhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.|$|E

At around 3:30 pm, more mutinous royal forces arrived to reinforce the crowd, bringing with them trained infantry officers and several cannons. After discovering that their weapons were too light <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> main walls of the fortress, the revolutionary crowd began to fire their cannons at the wooden gate of the Bastille. By now around 83 of the crowd had been killed and another 15 mortally wounded; only one of the Invalides had been killed in return.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2015, {{the last}} day for {{candidates}} to file, Bevin announced he would seek the Republican nomination for governor.

Bevin joined a field that included Commissioner of Agriculture James Comer, former Louisville Councilman Hal Heiner, and former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott. The National Journal predicted that Bevin would draw support away from Comer, the early front-runner, who had been appealing to Tea Party groups and already secured Congressman Massie's endorsement. The crowded primary was also projected <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> Republican nominee's chances in the general election, since Attorney General Jack Conway was the only major Democratic candidate, allowing him to conserve resources for the general election.
