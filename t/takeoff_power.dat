5|$|This was {{addressed}} in the major production model, the Do 17 Z-2. The Z-2 mounted the new 323P-1 version of the Fafnir with 746kW (1,000hp), which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low-level performance. The increase in <b>takeoff</b> <b>power</b> allowed the bomb load to be increased from 500kg (1,102lb) to 1,000kg (2,200lb). However the combat range with a full 1,000kg (2,200lb) bomb load was a very short 330km (200mi). The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of {{the sides of the}} upper part of the pod, but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner, only one of them could be fired at a time. From May 1940, 422 Do 17 Z-2s flew with Kampfgeschwader 2, Kampfgeschwader 3, Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77. The upgrades of the Z-2 had its overall weight increased from 17,600lbs to 17,920lbs (7,983 to 8128kg). After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151/15. Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers. The standard MG 15 machine guns were retained. These features were present in the next variant the Z-3.|$|E
25|$|July 19, 1986: All 4 {{occupants}} of a Cessna 421, registration number N6VR, {{were killed when}} the aircraft suffered an apparent right-hand engine failure, rolled over, and dived into a vacant lot immediately after takeoff from Addison Airport. The post-crash investigation revealed that the right-hand engine did not show any obvious signs of failure and its controls were not set to deliver full <b>takeoff</b> <b>power.</b> The crash was attributed to incorrect engine control operation; the pilot had recently purchased the Cessna 421 but had not been formally trained to fly it, {{and most of his}} twin-engined experience had been in an airplane with engine controls that operated in the reverse direction of those in the Cessna.|$|E

40|$|The UDF {{contrarotating}} propfan {{has been}} subjected to scale model wind tunnel testing to ascertain both general performance and acoustic characteristics data bases. Model Propulsion Simulator test rigs able to mount contrarotating fan blades of up to 24. 5 -inch diameter were used, and one of these was installed in a large anechoic test chamber for acoustic measurement of conditions simulating representative <b>takeoffs,</b> <b>power</b> cutbacks, and landing approaches. Attention is presently given to the data acquisition/reduction systems, the scaling criteria used to obtain engine size acoustic data, and comparisons with demonstrator aircraft in-flight acoustic test results...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} X- 29 A forward swept-wing aircraft {{has many}} unique and critical systems that require constant monitoring during ground or flight operation. One such {{system is the}} <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> shaft, which is the mechanical link between the engine and the aircraft-mounted accessory drive. The X- 29 A <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> shaft opertes in a range between 0 and 16, 810 rpm, is longer than most jet engine <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> shafts, and is made of graphite epoxy material. Since the X- 29 A aircraft operates on a single engine, failure of the shaft during flight could lead to loss of the aircraft. The monitoring techniques and test methods used during <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> shaft ground and flight operations are discussed. Test data are presented in two case studies where monitoring and testing of the shaft dynamics proved instrumental in discovering and isolating X- 29 A <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> shaft problems. The first study concerns the installation of an unbalanced shaft. The effect of the unbalance on the shaft vibration data and the procedure used to correct the problem are discussed. The second study deals with the shaft exceeding the established vibration limits during flight. This case {{study found that the}} vibration of connected rotating machinery unbalances contributed to the excessive vibration level of the shaft. The procedures used to identify the contributions of other rotating machinery unbalances to the <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> shaft unbalance are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Over time, Wright refined the R-760, using suffix {{letters to}} {{indicate}} successive versions. The original R-760 (or J-6-7) was rated for 225hp (168kW), while the R-760E of 1931 could do 250hp (186kW) {{thanks to an}} improved cylinder head design. Wright later added another suffix to show different power levels. The R-760E-1, introduced {{the same year as}} the R-760E, had a <b>takeoff</b> <b>power</b> rating of 300hp (224kW) thanks to higher-compression pistons and a greater RPM limit. The even more powerful R-760E-2 of 1935 could reach 350hp (261kW) for takeoff due to increased supercharging and an even higher RPM limit. On the other hand, the R-760E-T, designed for trainer aircraft, had the R-760E-1's high-compression pistons, but the supercharger was removed, thus giving just 235hp (175kW).|$|E
25|$|The Il-18B was {{powered by}} four Ivchenko AI-20A Series 1 turboprops, each {{providing}} a <b>takeoff</b> <b>power</b> of 2,985kW (4,000 shp) and sustained power of 2,090kW (2,800 shp) at cruise altitude. Early Il-18A production had initially been fitted with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, {{but they were}} soon exchanged for AI-20s. Later Il-18B production featured AI-20A Series 2 engines, with the same power ratings, but with technical improvements, thus older machines were updated with the Series 2 powerplants. The AI-20s drove four-bladed variable pitch reversible props with a diameter of 4.5 meters (14 feet 9 inches), featuring prominent propeller spinners, and hydraulic actuation for prop pitch. The engines were mounted above the wing and featured integrated fire extinguishers. The engines were started with electric motors, the power for the motors being provided by a ground cart.|$|E
500|$|It {{was learned}} {{that if the}} {{forklift}} were incorrectly positioned the engine/pylon assembly would not be stable as it was being handled, causing it to rock like a see-saw and jam the pylon against the wing's attachment points. The forklift operator was guided only by hand and voice signals, {{as he or she}} could not directly see the juncture between pylon and wing. [...] Positioning had to be extremely accurate or structural damage could result. Compounding the problem, maintenance work on N110AA did not go smoothly. The mechanics started to disconnect the engine and pylon, but there was a shift change halfway through the job. When work was resumed, the pylon was jammed on the wing and the forklift had to be re-positioned, resulting in unseen structural damage to the wing's pylon attachment points. The structural damage was not enough to cause an immediate failure. However, fatigue cracking developed, and worsened with each takeoff and landing cycle during the eight weeks that followed the maintenance on N110AA. [...] Finally, the damaged rear pylon mount reached its breaking point and failed. Due to the absence of this attachment, the engine, at full <b>takeoff</b> <b>power,</b> swung itself and the pylon upward on the latter's still-attached forward mount. The structure surrounding the forward pylon mount failed from the resulting stresses, and the engine/pylon assembly broke free of the wing.|$|E

2500|$|This variant was a {{significant}} improvement over the earlier engine variants in all respects.

2500|$|While the C90 is {{approved}} for <b>takeoff</b> <b>power</b> of 95 horsepower (71kW) for five minutes, the designation {{is derived from}} its continuous power rating of 90 hp (67kW). [...] As noted above, certain models of the C90 replace the usual carburetor with a fuel injection system. [...] In addition, there are models which provide for the installation of a controllable-pitch propeller and one, the C90-12FP, designed for pusher installation. While having slightly less horsepower than the O200, many floatplane operators prefer {{the performance of the}} C90 over the O200, due to its higher torque at lower rpm. This is primarily due to the C90's camshaft design. The C90 is also known by its military designation of O-205.|$|E

On August 13, Roush made his first at track appearance since the incident at the Michigan International Speedway.
