On December 6, the Chicago Tribune {{reported}} that Jackson was among the minority of potential candidates {{who had not been}} granted a meeting with Blagojevich on the subject, but two days later Blagojevich granted Jackson a meeting. [...] On December 9, the day after a 90-minute meeting that Jackson described as his first meeting with Blagojevich in years, the Rod Blagojevich federal corruption scandal became public when the Governor was arrested. On December 10, Jackson was contacted by federal prosecutors for questioning with regard to the scandal involving Governor Blagojevich's search for a replacement. [...] The press speculated that Jackson was [...] "Senate Candidate #5", for whom it is alleged by Blagojevich that emissaries offered up to a million dollars in exchange for the appointment. [...] Jackson, however, denies any wrongdoing, and says that the U.S. Attorney's office assured him that he is not a target of the investigation. [...] In a press conference, his lawyer confirmed his belief that Jackson is candidate No. 5, but asserted that he has done nothing wrong. [...] Immediately thereafter, in his own news conference, Jackson confirmed that he is a subject and not a target of the investigation and emphatically stated his opposition to [...] "pay to play" [...] politics. [...] On December 16, a Jackson spokesperson confirmed special federal investigators have been questioning him since the summer. [...] Also WLS-TV reported December 15 that Jackson has notified investigators that Blagojevich refused to appoint Sandi Jackson, his wife, as state lottery director because Jackson refused to donate $25,000 to the governor's campaign fund. Jackson spokesman Kenneth Edmonds clarified that although Jackson had been a federal informant for over a decade, never did his cooperation concern <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>investigation</b> into the Senate seat.|$|E

50|$|German neurologists {{documented}} clinical {{descriptions of}} extinction a century ago, but the syndrome subsequently received less systematic attention than other classical neurological syndromes {{in part due}} to the rareness of suitable theoretical ideas. Moreover, despite the dramatic loss of awareness for one side, extinction was rarely considered in discussions of the neural basis of conscious perceptual experience until recently. In extinction there is a spatially specific loss of awareness. This has been difficult to explain because so many neural pathways conventionally associated with conscious perception (including primary sensory areas) remain intact in many patients. There is also much excitement about the possibility of relating awareness to neural substrates in extinction studies. In addition to revealing the critical lesion sites associated with the various clinical manifestations of visual neglect, a key message of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>investigation</b> {{is that there is a}} need to develop more sensitive and nuanced assessment tools to characterize the different facets of this heterogeneous syndrome. It will be important to bring laboratory tests into the clinic in an effort to identify speciﬁc cognitive functions by examining each in isolation thus combining more speciﬁc descriptions extinction with better clinical measures that isolate speciﬁc cognitive functions to yield more consistent lesion mapping results in the future.|$|E
