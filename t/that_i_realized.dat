You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E

When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. Then I found an instrument, and through <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized,</b> that I am able to cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and the rest of HIM have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E

2500|$|Miller {{began work}} on writing the {{screenplay}} for The Misfits in 1960, directed by John Huston and starring Monroe. But {{it was during the}} filming that Miller and Monroe's relationship hit difficulties, and he later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life. Monroe was taking drugs to help her sleep and more drugs to help her wake up, which caused her to arrive on the set late and then have trouble remembering her lines. Huston was unaware that Miller and Monroe were having problems in their private life. He recalled later, [...] "I was impertinent enough to say to Arthur that to allow her to take drugs of any kind was criminal and utterly irresponsible. Shortly after <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that she wouldn't listen to Arthur at all; he had no say over her actions." ...|$|E

[...] Dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for the Wallflowers' two previous albums, explaining that he didn't want to avoid the subject of his personal life, as he had done in the past: [...] "(Breach) was the first record <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that it's necessary and I have a right to write about anything that I want to write about. [...] I'm not going to dance around these subjects anymore [...] [...] [...] I don't have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that don't come naturally to me but I also realized that I needed to stop this nonsense of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody; it just doesn't really matter anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
2500|$|Jemison {{graduated}} from Chicago's Morgan Park High School in 1973 and entered Stanford University {{at the age}} of 16. [...] "I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me," [...] Jemison said. [...] "It’s not until recently <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [...] go that far away from home." [...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" [...] She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.|$|E

2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
