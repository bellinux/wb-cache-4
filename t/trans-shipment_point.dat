5|$|In {{addition}} to NIT, Norfolk {{is home to}} Lambert's Point Docks, the largest coal <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>point</b> in the Northern Hemisphere, with an annual throughput of approximately 48,000,000 tons. Bituminous coal is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The coal is loaded onto trains {{and sent to the}} port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.|$|E

25|$|The Dominican Republic {{has become}} a <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>point</b> for Colombian drugs destined for Europe {{as well as the}} United States and Canada. Money-laundering via the Dominican Republic is favored by Colombian drug cartels for the ease of illicit {{financial}} transactions. In 2004 it was estimated that 8% of all cocaine smuggled into the United States had come through the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic responded with increased efforts to seize drug shipments, arrest and extradite those involved, and combat money-laundering.|$|E
30|$|The case {{scenario}} presented is a three source (LPG plants) located in Warri, Delta State, Nigeria. To expand the system, it became necessary to create two <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>points</b> (TP) within the conurbation to enable customers at strategic locations {{have access to}} available products at favorable cost. Products can flow {{from any of the}} three sources to the two TP. Fuzzy logic rule is suggested for effective facility design. Table  1 shows a clear illustration of products available at the source and demand at all <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>points</b> within the period of investigation.|$|R
50|$|The GB&S was {{designed}} {{to compete with the}} Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (OA&PS). Both acted as <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>points</b> between lakers on the upper Great Lakes and Atlantic ports in the east, especially grain shipments from the Canadian prairies to docks in Montreal and the east coast. CPR had originally planned to run a line almost parallel to the OA&PS, but lost an important court case and were forced to build the line much further south than intended. To service the new route, CPR built Port McNicoll on Georgian Bay outside Midland. From here the line ran east-southeast to connect to the CPR's Ontario and Quebec Railway mainline for shipment further east.|$|R
40|$|Scatter {{search is}} a {{population-based}} method {{that has been}} shown to yield high-quality outcomes for combinatorial optimization problems. It uses strategies for combining solution vectors that have proved effective in a variety of problem settings. In this paper, we present a scatter search implementation for an NP-hard variant of the classic p-hub median prob-lem. Specifically, we tackle the uncapacitated r-allocation p-hub median problem, which consists of minimizing the cost of transporting the traffics between nodes of a network through special facilities that act as <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>points.</b> This problem has a significant number of applications in practice, such as the design of transportation and telecommunications networks. As it is customary in metaheuristic implementations, we design spe-cific methods to create an efficient solving procedure based on the scatter search methodology. In particular, we propose mechanisms to generate, combine, and improve solutions for this problem. Special mention de-serves the use of path-relinking {{as an extension of the}} classical combination method. Extensive computational experiments establish the effectiveness of our procedure in relation to approaches previously identified to be best...|$|R
25|$|Moncton grew rapidly {{during the}} early part of the 20th century, {{particularly}} after provincial lobbying saw the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912; this line would link Moncton with Edmundston, Quebec City, and on to Winnipeg where the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway continued to Saskatoon, Edmonton, and Prince Rupert. The First World War brought a halt to the era of railway expansion but the city would become an important <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>point</b> for materiel funnelling onwards to the port of Halifax.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s {{a serious}} {{attempt was made}} to stamp out the demon alcohol. Prohibition of the sale and {{possession}} of it was enacted by the federal government. This law created the conditions for illicit behaviour such as illegal stills, rum-runners and speakeasies; it alsocreated opportunity for those {{on the right side of}} the law, such as Joseph Gammon, otherwise employed as a barber in town. In April 1921 he led a mounted posse of four other men to Portage Brook, near Grand Falls to a suspected still, where as it turned out at dawn, fourlawbreakers were caught red-handed. The benefits of surprise and guns allowed the posse to overawe and apprehend the culprits. Thirteen barrels of whiskey along with the ingredients and implements necessary to manufacture it were seized in the one of the greatest collars onrecord until then. <b>Trans-shipment</b> <b>points</b> were rumoured to lie at Miscou Island and on the Caraquet coast. In October 1934 the 40-ton rum-runner Paul T was seized at Shippagan with 1,200 gallons of liquor and a large number of cigarettes aboard. The vessel was beached, burned and destroyed by the authorities. Authorities seized in October 1935 1,580 gallons of liquor from a barn at Belledune, where it had been offloaded by an unknown vessel. Sergeant Bedford Peters of the RCMP assessed the value at $55,000. The duty payable was $17,380.|$|R
50|$|Sir Lawrence {{was clearly}} an {{entrepreneur}} who saw opportunities {{and took them}} up, for example he is noted for having built the Forth and Clyde Canal, which linked east coast with the west coast, through his estates. That canal was used mainly for the shipment of bulk commodities, especially coal from the Lanarkshire pits to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Nearby lies a modern feature the Falkirk Wheel which links the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. Sir Lawrence Dundas founded Grangemouth in 1777 at {{the eastern end of}} the Forth and Clyde canal as a <b>trans-shipment</b> and service <b>point.</b> Grangemouth today is probably Scotland’s busiest port. The rapidly expanding town of Grangemouth gradually absorbed the parish of Bothkennar. In 1789, GEORGE III, William Frederick, King of Great Britain and Ireland as part of a greater earldom confirmed the barony and granted the original charter which now serves as documented reference for subsequent tracing of the title.|$|R
5000|$|The Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona {{metropolitan}} areas are major <b>trans-shipment</b> and distribution <b>points</b> for the cartel in the US. To coordinate {{operations in the}} southeast US, Atlanta {{has emerged as a}} major distribution center and accounting hub and the presence of the Sinaloa Cartel there has brought ruthless violence to that area. Chicago continues to be a major Sinaloa distribution point for the Midwest, taking advantage of a strong local demand market and convergence of several major interstate systems that offer distribution throughout the US. The cartel also benefited for a long time of easiness in cash transactions and money laundering through banks with presence both in the US and Mexico like HSBC. In 2013, the Chicago Crime Commission named Joaquin [...] "Chapo" [...] Guzmán [...] "Public Enemy No. 1" [...] of a city Guzmán has never set foot in. He is the only individual to receive the title since Al Capone. The focal point for Sinaloa in Chicago is the city's [...] "Little Village" [...] neighborhood. From this strategic point, the cartel distributes their product at the wholesale level to dozens of local street gangs, as much as 2 metric tons a month, in a city with over 120,000 documented gang members. The Gangster Disciples are one of the local gangs most actively working with the cartel.|$|R
2500|$|Soon, {{the demand}} for cocaine was skyrocketing in the United States, and Escobar {{organized}} more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in South Florida, California, {{and other parts of}} the country. He and cartel co-founder Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>point</b> in the Bahamas, an island called Norman's Cay about [...] southeast of the Florida coast. According to his brother, Escobar did not purchase Norman's Cay; it was, instead, a sole venture of Lehder's. Escobar and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a [...] airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine. From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medellín Cartel. With the enormous profits generated by this route, Escobar was soon able to purchase [...] of land in Antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the Hacienda Nápoles. The luxury house he created contained a zoo, a lake, a sculpture garden, a private bullring, and other diversions for his family and the cartel.|$|E
