2500|$|The Moatfield site {{provides}} a rare snapshot {{into the lives}} of Iroquonians from the 13th Century. Evidence indicates the ossuary was a cemetery for one community. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here,</b> <b>is</b> that it served a community, not just a family or a specific kin group, a pattern that is more typically seen in populations from this period. Health patterns observed in the remains evidence a reliance on agriculture, and this reliance changed over time. Regardless of the changes, a continuity in the relationship between the dead and the living was maintained. The socio-political patterns associated with the evolving agricultural subsistence base, are [...] reflected in the bones of Moatfield people.|$|E
50|$|The Kontakion is also Byzantine-like in its melody. The soprano and the alto sing it {{together}} while the tenor and bass provide the ison. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> A melodic minor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> non-capturing {{and also}} {{thematic}} (that is, it is logically {{related to the}} rest of the solution): 1.a7. The variations are largely the same as in the original: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{prospective}} liabilities. Various tranches of {{the notes}} were due for payment at various future dates, {{the latest of}} which were 2045 (or thirty years after the date that the case was being heard in the Supreme Court).|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> {{complication}} <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> nondifferentiability of {{the value}} function within the dynamic programming, {{as well as the}} spike discontinuity (4).|$|R
2500|$|The above {{expressions}} tell us {{how much}} enzymes [...] and [...] control the steady state flux. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> point <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that changes in enzyme concentration, or equivalently the enzyme activity, must be brought about by an external action.|$|R
50|$|There {{are clearly}} good lessons {{that can be}} drawn from the MOA-AD {{experience}} which can shed light on how to move forward. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that civil society and peace advocates recognize, accept and learn from those lessons.|$|E
50|$|This {{is quite}} simply a {{description}} of where exactly the retouch {{is located on the}} flake. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to be very specific. The retouch extensiveness for each area should also be described. This entails whether the retouch is total or partial. Proper flake terminology should be used in these descriptions.|$|E
5000|$|... "Pad 39C is {{the latest}} {{addition}} to our portfolio of launch pads," [...] said Scott Colloredo, CPD director. [...] "The small class market is here. The demand {{for that kind of}} launcher is increasing. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> this is really what a launch site for a small class launcher needs to look like." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> feature <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> loss {{of freedom}} of maneuver. If a force can easily {{overcome}} a terrain feature, while maintaining its fighting strength, then it is not breaking out; it is maneuvering {{in the same way}} any force would over non-restrictive terrain.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> feature <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> paths form a {{basis for}} the root {{operators}} like that of a monomial representation: when a root operator is applied to the basis element for a path, the result is either 0 or the basis element for another path.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> theme <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of the Dorsai culture, {{and the creation of}} the Dorsai military model which makes their soldiers the best among all the settled worlds. It also shows the growth of the separate planetary cultures and their evolution to independence from Earth.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of exercise states that those things most often repeated are best remembered. It {{is the basis}} of drill and practice. It has been proven that students learn best and retain information longer when they have meaningful practice and repetition. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the practice must be meaningful. It is clear that practice leads to improvement only when it is followed by positive feedback.|$|E
5000|$|Former {{managing}} editor of Foreign Affairs, contributing editor of Time magazine, and now CNN host Fareed Zakaria says the President-elect Trump's call with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan was {{not a bad idea}} while some people are getting a bit too critical. [...] "The {{truth of the matter is}} we need leverage with China... on many issues we need to be able to push them harder... <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that it should be part of a thought-through strategy." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{hierarchy}} makes proving {{certain kinds}} of theorems about Haken manifolds a matter of induction. One proves the theorem for 3-balls. Then one proves that if the theorem is true for pieces resulting from a cutting of a Haken manifold, then it is true for that Haken manifold. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the cutting takes place along a surface that was very [...] "nice", i.e. incompressible. This makes proving the induction step feasible in many cases.|$|E
5000|$|With a Sano shunt, a hole {{is made in}} {{the wall}} of the single {{ventricle}}, and a Gore-Tex conduit is used to connect the ventricle to the pulmonary artery. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> difference <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> blood flow is more pulsatile than with the Blalock-Taussig version.|$|R
40|$|We design carbyne {{transistor}} {{which is}} integrable into the existing silicon technology {{and can be}} scaled up in a rather broad range [...] starting from that prepared by us (by 0. 5 -mkm technology) up to the monomolecular one because <b>the</b> <b>key</b> mechanism <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> inter-chain charge transfer. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> concept <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{inherent}} in the phrase again descends into X. The process of looking forward, failing, backing up, and then retrying the next alternative is known in parsing as backtracking, and it is primarily backtracking that presents opportunities for memoization in parsing. Consider a function , where the parameters are as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that National Starch did not {{demonstrate}} that the investment banking, legal, and other costs it incurred in connection with Unilever’s acquisition of its shares are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under §162(a). In addition to the analysis provided by the two previous courts, the Supreme Court cited {{the fact that there}} is a long history of finding that the purpose of changing the corporate structure for the benefit of future operations is not an ordinary and necessary business expense. General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326. F.2d, at 715.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recent survey}} by {{internet}} security experts BullGuard showed a lack of insight into the rising number of malicious threats affecting mobile phones, with 53% of users claiming that they are unaware of security software for Smartphones. A further 21% argued that such protection was unnecessary, and 42% admitted it hadn't crossed their mind ("Using APA," [...] 2011). These statistics show consumers are not concerned about security risks because they believe {{it is not a}} serious problem. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to always remember smartphones are effectively handheld computers and are just as vulnerable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{form of the}} Leggett-Garg inequality {{derives from}} examining {{a system that has}} only two possible states. These states have corresponding measurement values [...] <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that we have measurements at two different times, and one or more times between the first and last measurement. The simplest example is where the system is measured at three successive times [...] Now suppose, for instance, that there is a perfect correlation [...] of 1 between times [...] and [...] That is to say, that for N realisations of the experiment, the temporal correlation reads ...|$|E
50|$|The APE can be {{computed}} correspondingly. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> idea <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{to use the}} first-stage regression {{to purify}} the error term and then estimate the model without the endogeneity issue {{based on the assumption}} about the correlation structure. Another important assumption <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the normality distributional assumption, which cannot be relaxed under the Tobit model framework.|$|R
30|$|In this article, we {{consider}} the compressible micropolar viscous flow in a bounded or unbounded domain Ω ⊆ ℝ 3. We prove the existence of unique local strong solutions for large initial data satisfying some compatibility conditions. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> point <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> initial density need not be positive and may vanish in an open set.|$|R
40|$|We present here {{a version}} of the {{existence}} and uniqueness result of time periodic solutions to the viscous Burgers equation with irregular forcing terms (with Sobolev regularity - 1 in space). <b>The</b> <b>key</b> result <b>here</b> <b>is</b> an a priori estimate which is simpler than the previously treated case of forcing terms with regularity - 1 / 2 in time...|$|R
5000|$|In {{setting up}} a {{financial}} reinsurance treaty, the reinsurer will provide capital (there {{are a number of}} ways of doing this, discussed below). In return, the insurer will pay the capital back over time. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to ensure that repayments only come out of surplus emerging from the reinsured block of business. The benefit of this surplus-limitation {{comes from the fact that}} in the regulatory accounts there is no value ascribed to future profits - which means the liability to repay the reinsurer is made from a series of payments which are deemed to be zero.|$|E
50|$|Shared {{services}} is {{the provision of}} a service by one part of an organization or group, where that service had previously been found, {{in more than one}} part of the organization or group. Thus the funding and resourcing of the service is shared and the providing department effectively becomes an internal service provider. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the idea of 'sharing' within an organization or group. This sharing needs to fundamentally include shared accountability of results by the unit from where the work is migrated to the provider. The provider on the other hand needs to ensure that the agreed results are delivered based on defined measures (KPIs, cost, quality etc.).|$|E
50|$|The Moatfield site {{provides}} a rare snapshot {{into the lives}} of Iroquonians from the 13th Century. Evidence indicates the ossuary was a cemetery for one community. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here,</b> <b>is</b> that it served a community, not just a family or a specific kin group, a pattern that is more typically seen in populations from this period.

50|$|In {{moving forward}} with genetic {{research}} on XNAs, various questions must come into consideration regarding biosafety, biosecurity, ethics, and governance/regulation. One of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> questions <b>here</b> <b>is</b> whether XNA in an in vivo setting would intermix with DNA and RNA in its natural environment, thereby rendering scientists unable to control or predict its implications in genetic mutation.|$|R
50|$|A Tens game lasts 20 minutes {{except for}} the final, which lasts 30 minutes. Played fast and furious, it is an {{exciting}} variation of the popular game of rugby Sevens but {{more closely related to}} the rugby Fifteens format. The Tens allows both forward and back line play. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> factor <b>here</b> <b>is</b> all-round skills are translated into teamwork at fast pace.|$|R
40|$|Hugh Laurie said it best, “I am {{a coffee}} fanatic. Once {{you go to}} proper coffee, you can’t go back. You cannot go back. ” <b>The</b> <b>key</b> term <b>here</b> <b>is</b> “proper coffee,” so ladies (and gentlemen perhaps) hang up your Pumpkin Spice Lattes and your Iced Caramel Macchiatos. It’s about to go down, you’re about to get schooled, in coffee...|$|R
5000|$|It is a {{cover for}} the {{withdrawal}} of services and minimises the accountability of the state; blurring the lines {{of responsibility for the}} quality of service. If co-production is done for the wrong reasons this can be the case. It is a question of means and ends. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to emphasise that 'co' requires input both from people who deliver services and people who have been seen as 'recipients' of them. They are likely to play different roles and power will be distributed differently in co-produced services but contribution from both is essential, otherwise services become 'self-organised' which is a different thing entirely.|$|E
5000|$|The {{situation}} comprises {{a complex}} web {{of material and}} social aspects of the environment, such as history, culture, physical environmental features, and policy environment, {{as well as more}} local aspects such as task complexity, organizational structure, or staff stability. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to identify and focus on the [...] "aspects of the situation that enable and constrain leadership practice but also capture how they shape that practice." [...] Whereas Contingency Theory describes the situation as merely the context within which individuals act, a distributed perspective looks to the situation as constitutive, {{in the sense that it}} both influences and is influenced by the actions of the people in it.|$|E
50|$|Cognitive {{behavioural}} therapy is a therapy {{that works with}} irrational thinking towards a specific situation. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the person may have not had that specific behavioural problem their whole life, and allowing them to view the event with a new perspective can change their behaviour. This is done differently from psychoanalytic therapy by exposing the patient to the stimulus they are afraid of. Through this exposure, they can unlearn any patterns of thought they had towards it by realizing that they are safe, referred to as extinction. Although, {{studies have shown that}} certain stimuli can cue a spontaneous recovery if there was not a full extinction of the associated perception to a memory.|$|E
40|$|In {{the second}} of our free Advice Note series on how to write Impact Case Studies for the REF, Patrick Dunleavy {{explains}} how to sift out achievements that are ‘possible’ Cases and to begin developing them successfully. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> thing <b>here</b> <b>is</b> to stay auditable and to ‘process trace’ in as much detail as you can how your research achieved external impacts...|$|R
50|$|Other related {{processes}} include social support, {{which involves}} giving others emotional, informational, or practical support, and interpersonal influence, which involves {{trying to change}} the attitudes and/or behaviors of other people. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> difference <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that interpersonal emotion regulation is primarily concerned with changing other people's feelings; any changes to attitudes or behaviors are secondary to the impact on emotion.|$|R
5000|$|Tenev’s novel Party Headquarters (Altera 2007) {{deals with}} the social paradoxes of the post-communist Bulgarian society. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> metaphor <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Chernobyl disaster. It won the Vick Foundation Award for Novel of the Year (2007). [...] "Georgi Tenev {{examines}} the most recent past by avoiding taboos and using distinct words - it is a philosophical dealing with memory which uses powerful imagery." ...|$|R
