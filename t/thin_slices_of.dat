5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E

25|$|In East Asia, {{particularly}} Southeast Asia, rice {{is by far}} {{the predominant}} starch crop, with potatoes a secondary crop, especially in China and Japan. However, it is used in northern China where rice is not easily grown, with a popular dish being 青椒土豆丝 (qīng jiāo tǔ dòu sī), made with green pepper, vinegar and <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> potato. In the winter, roadside sellers in northern China will also sell roasted potatoes. It is also occasionally seen in Korean and Thai cuisines.|$|E

500|$|The {{citizens}} of Leningrad {{were subjected to}} heavy bombardment and a siege that would last 872 days and starve {{more than a million}} people to death, of whom approximately 400,000 were children below the age of 14. The German-Finnish blockade cut off access to food, fuel and raw materials, and rations reached a low, for the non-working population, of four ounces (five <b>thin</b> <b>slices)</b> <b>of</b> bread and a little watery soup per day. Starving Soviet civilians began to eat their domestic animals, along with hair tonic and Vaseline. Some desperate citizens resorted to cannibalism; Soviet records list 2,000 people arrested for [...] "the use of human meat as food" [...] during the siege, 886 of them during the first winter of 1941–42. The Wehrmacht planned to seal off Leningrad, starve out the population, and then demolish the city entirely.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the recipe, all of which involve a cutlet, cheese, and meat. A popular way to prepare chicken cordon bleu is to butterfly cut a chicken breast, place a <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> ham inside, along with a <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> a soft, easily melted cheese such as Swiss. The chicken breast is then rolled into a roulade, coated in bread crumbs and then deep fried. Other variations exist with the chicken baked rather than fried.|$|R
2500|$|An Italian beef is a sandwich, {{originating}} in Chicago, composed of <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> seasoned roast beef, simmered and served au jus (known by locals as 'gravy') {{on a long}} Italian-style roll. The sandwich's history dates {{back at least to}} the 1930s. The bread itself is, at the diner's preference, often dipped (or double-dipped) into the au jus the meat is cooked in, and the sandwich is typically topped off with Chicago-style giardiniera (called [...] "hot") or sauteed, green Italian sweet peppers (called [...] "sweet").|$|E
2500|$|Potato chips, {{also known}} as crisps in British English, are <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy. Potato chips serve as an appetizer, side dish, or snack. The basic chips are cooked and salted, and {{additional}} varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives. The original potato chip recipe was invented by chef George Crum at Moon's Lake House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853. Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin {{that they could not}} be eaten with a fork. As they could not be fried normally in a pan, he decided to stir-fry the potato slices. Against Crum's expectation, the guest was ecstatic about the new chips and they soon became a regular item on the lodge's menu, and were known as [...] "Saratoga chips".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Voronoff's {{negative}} {{reputation was}} softened. In November 1991, {{one of the}} oldest peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, The Lancet, suggested that the file on Voronoff's work be reopened and in particular that [...] "the Medical Research Council should fund further studies on monkey glands." [...] By 1994, there were calls for a qualified apology from the orthodox medical establishment for dismissing Voronoff's work. In particular, since modern medicine has established that the Sertoli cells of the testes constitute a barrier to the immune system, rendering the testes an immunologically privileged site for the transplantation of foreign tissue, the <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> monkey testicles Voronoff implanted into the patient's testicles may in theory have survived to produce some benefit. There have recently been successful experiments reducing insulin requirements in diabetics by implanting into them pancreatic islet cells from pigs coated in Sertoli cells to insulate them from attack by the immune system. [...] No immunosuppressive drugs were required. In 1998, the sweeping popularity of Viagra brought forth references to Voronoff.|$|E

60|$|Young John {{was some}} time absent, and, {{when he came}} back, showed {{that he had been}} outside by {{bringing}} with him fresh butter in a cabbage leaf, some <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> boiled ham in another cabbage leaf, and a little basket of water-cresses and salad herbs.

I have also seen with various kinds of leaves, left for some time in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, that the grains of chlorophyll ran together and partially coalesced; and this seems to be a form of aggregation.|$|E

60|$|Yorkshire {{people in}} those days took their tea round the table, sitting well into it, with their knees duly {{introduced}} under the mahogany.

60|$|The {{first thing}} in the morning I took my rifle and went out to where I had left the carcass of the deer. It was gone. It had been dragged away.

But search as I might, I could not find the track of the animal that had dragged off the deer. After {{following}} the trail for a few rods, I decided to return to camp and cook breakfast before going any farther. While I was at it I cut many <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> venison, and, after roasting them, I stored them away in the capacious pocket of my coat.|$|E
