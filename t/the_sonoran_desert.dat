5|$|After Tonopah's gold strike waned, {{they moved}} in 1905 to Goldfield, Nevada, where his brother Virgil {{and his wife were}} living. Tex Rickard was also already there and had opened a second Northern Saloon. He hired Wyatt as a pit boss. Wyatt also staked mining claims just outside Death Valley and {{elsewhere}} in the Mojave Desert. In 1906, he discovered several deposits of gold and copper near <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims near the Whipple Mountains. While in Los Angeles, they lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly in the summer.|$|E

5|$|Carl Eytel (September 12, 1862 â€“ September 17, 1925) was a German American {{artist who}} built his {{reputation}} for paintings and drawings of desert subjects in the American Southwest. Immigrating to the United States in 1885, he settled in Palm Springs, California in 1903. With an extensive knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert,</b> Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James as he wrote the successful Wonders of the Colorado Desert, and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work. While he enjoyed success as an artist, he lived as an ascetic and would die in poverty. Eytel's most important work, Desert Near Palm Springs, hangs in the History Room of the California State Library.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 8 (I-8) is an Interstate Highway in {{the southwestern}} United States. It runs from the {{southern}} edge of Mission Bay at Sunset Cliffs Boulevard in San Diego, California, almost at the Pacific Ocean, to the junction with I-10, just southeast of Casa Grande, Arizona. In California, the freeway travels through the San Diego metropolitan area as the Ocean Beach Freeway and the Mission Valley Freeway before traversing the Cuyamaca Mountains and providing access through the Imperial Valley, including the city of El Centro. Crossing the Colorado River into Arizona, I-8 continues through the city of Yuma across <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> to Casa Grande, in between the cities of Phoenix and Tucson.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the near}} {{extermination}} of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, elk, and other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with prairie dogs, {{though it was}} just as much at home in semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the extermination of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E
5000|$|This {{plant is}} {{primarily}} found in <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> Colorado <b>Desert</b> of southeastern California, and <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Deserts</b> of southern Arizona and of northwestern Sonora state (Mexico). It is found predominantly in desert washes or bajadas, {{a result of}} its need for water, although occasionally it can be found in creosote desert scrub habitat, accessing seeps in desert hills up to 3,600 ft. [...] Also found in the far eastern Mojave Desert of California in the 'upper' Lower Colorado River Valley, and occasionally in the Mojave's mountains.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} a spiny {{succulent}} shrub, with thick water-storing stems and leaves that are deciduous {{in the long}} dry season.

5|$|The bald eagle's {{natural range}} covers most of North America, {{including}} most of Canada, {{all of the}} continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. Today, {{they are much more}} common (almost attaining their peak numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} half of Africa {{is occupied}} by the world's most extensive hot, dry region, the Sahara Desert. Some deserts are also occupying much of southern Africa : the Namib and the Kalahari. Across Asia, a large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia west-southwest through western Pakistan (Balochistan) and Iran into the Arabian Desert in Saudi Arabia. Most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, making it the world's driest inhabited continent. In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina. The drier areas of the United States are regions where <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> overspreads the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin and central Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|While some of {{the native}} flora and fauna of <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> can be found within Phoenix city limits, most {{are found in the}} suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas {{surrounding}} the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just north of the border, the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads merge back together; the fork to the west is for cars, and the fork to the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. From here to I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert</b> which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In <b>the</b> <b>Sonoran</b> <b>Desert,</b> Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
