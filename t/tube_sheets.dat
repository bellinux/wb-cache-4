In this paper, FEM was used to predict the welding residual stress in the elliptical <b>tube</b> to <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> weld of a phthalic anhydride switch condenser. In order to validate the simulated results, a test sample with circular-shaped <b>tube</b> to <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> joint was prepared.

(WPT) of Baton Rouge, Louisiana has developed magnetic fluid conditioner (MFC) which is an in-line device designed to expose a fluid stream to a high magnetic field preventing the scale formation. In view of its increasing use, M/s Labah contracting, a sole agent of WPT in Middle East, and Research & Development Center (RDC), SWCC, Al-Jubail, agreed mutually to evaluate the performance of MFC.

40|$|A new {{bioreactor}} (shell-and-tube co-immobilized cell bioreactor) for integrated nitrogen {{removal from}} wastewater was developed. The configuration of this bioreactor {{was similar to}} a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, and consisted of a bundle of parallel tubes made up of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel, containing nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, fixed on to the <b>tube</b> <b>sheets.</b> The tube bundle was contained in a cylindrical shell which was provided with two channels, one at each end. Ammonia nitrogen wastewater was introduced into the shell-side space surrounding the tubes. At the same time, air was pumped through an air-stone into wastewater for nitrification. Ethanol solution was pumped into one channel. It flowed through the tubes into the other channel and was withdrawn into the ethanol solution tank for recycling. An integrated nitrogen removal process was studied using this bioreactor. The nitrogen removal process could be much simplified when it {{was carried out in}} this bioreactor, because only a small amount of ethanol diffused into the wastewater from the recycling ethanol solution, and the BOD 5 value in the effluent was lower than 30 mg l - 1. In addition, no accumulation of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate in the recycling ethanol solution was observed. The total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) concentration was below 3 mg l - 1 after the ethanol solution was recycled in the bioreactor for a week. The ammonia oxidation rate when nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously in a bioreactor was about twice as fast as when only nitrification occurred (denitrification was restrained). The operational system remained stable for more then 3 months and the mechanical strength of the tubes was excellent even after 3 months of continuous operation. The existence of a short-cut of nitrogen removal was indicated, in which ammonia nitrogen was first converted into nitrite and subsequent denitrification proceeded directly from nitrite using the co-immobilized mixed culture. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} hazards from undetected corrosion {{in complex}} equipment using findings from a collaborative forensic {{investigation into the}} destructive separation of a heat exchanger on an offshore gas storage platform. The heat exchanger had been in service for 24 years. The heat exchanger was a conventional shell-and-tube type with both the tubes and shell being manufactured from titanium. However the bonnet and <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> were manufactured from carbon steel. The seawater side of the carbon steel <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> had been protected from corrosion by titanium cladding. The investigation revealed localised corrosion of the carbon steel <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> in areas exposed to acidic condensate containing hydrogen sulphide. Corrosion was galvanic in nature and had occurred where, by design; the carbon steel–titanium interface was exposed. The results showed that hydrogen, generated cathodically by the galvanic corrosion, had formed titanium hydride in the interfacial region of the titanium cladding. The evidence indicated that {{the separation of the}} tube bundle and shell from the bonnet was probably initiated when a large area of the cladding bond interface failed suddenly due to hydride formation. The final destructive separation of the tube bundle {{can be explained by the}} deformation of the cladding after complete failure of the bonded interface with the <b>tube</b> <b>sheet.</b> This article and the forensic investigation were funded by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
