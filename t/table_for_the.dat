5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the <b>table</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league <b>table</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them {{at the beginning of}} March. They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it {{was announced}} that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|March {{started with}} two more {{consecutive}} defeats. Dagenham & Redbridge defeated City 2–0 in their first game at Valley Parade, when Barry Conlon missed a penalty and then an open goal both when the score was 1–0. In the following game, Peter Thorne scored a penalty to give City the lead against Stockport County, but County scored twice to win 2–1. Four days later, Bradford recorded their third victory of the season against Chester City, when Conlon scored the only goal {{of the game in}} a 1–0 victory. Conlon scored another in the following game but City again were beaten, 2–1 by Mansfield Town. Following Wetherall's announcement that he would retire, City's supporters staged a special day to celebrate his career and contribution to the club, during the away fixture on 22 March 2008 at Rotherham United, where the team had lost 4–1 the previous season during Wetherall's spell as player-manager. The result of the game finished 1–1, during which Omar Daley was sent off. City played a second game two days later, because of the Easter fixture list, when Peter Thorne scored the 150th league goal of his career to help City beat Chesterfield 1–0. The month finished with a 3–1 victory over Darlington, when Tom Penford scored his first goal for the club, and both Barry Conlon and Joe Colbeck scored against their former club. The victory put City into {{the top half of the}} <b>table</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since September.

5|$|Supporters of Newcastle United {{are drawn}} {{from all over the}} North East and beyond, with supporters' clubs in some {{countries}} across the world. The club's nickname is 'The Magpies', while the club's supporters are also known as the Geordies or the Toon Army. The name Toon originates from the Geordie pronunciation of town. In a 2004 survey by Co-operative Financial Services, it was found that Newcastle United topped the league <b>table</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cost incurred and distance travelled by Newcastle-based fans wishing to travel to every Premier League away game. The total distance travelled for a fan to attend every away game from Newcastle was found to be equivalent to a round-the-world trip. In the 2009–10 season, when the club were playing in English football's second tier, the Football League Championship, the average attendance at St James' Park was 43,388, the fourth-highest for an English club that season. At the end of the 2011–12 Premier league season, Newcastle United held the third-highest average attendance for the season, at 49,935. This figure was only surpassed by Arsenal and Manchester United, the only two clubs in the Premier League with larger stadiums.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements. In 1914, several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted {{the gap in the}} periodic <b>table</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> then-undiscovered element 72. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on celtium in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy. The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the {{discovery of}} celtium, while the physicists relied {{on the use of the}} new X-ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72. By early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles R. Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth.|$|E
5|$|Benfica began December {{hoping to}} extend their {{domestic}} winning streak, and the club's first game hosted Vitória de Setúbal on 1 December. Laionel opened the score for Setúbal in the 35th minute, with Benfica only responding {{in the second half}} with Kostas Katsouranis. In the 59th minute, David Suazo fired a powerful shot that beat Pedro Alves and put Benfica in the lead. However, in the 91st minute, a bicycle kick by Anderson do Ó cleared Quim and levelled the game. Although Sánchez Flores called the equaliser an accident, he soon dropped Quim in favour of José Moreira. A week later, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros to play Marítimo. They had their best performance of the season, winning 6–0 with Suazo and Nuno Gomes each scoring twice. The win put Benfica {{at the top of the}} <b>table</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since May 2005, and was their largest away win since 1974. On 13 December, Benfica played Leixões for a place in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals. On a rainy night at Estádio do Mar, neither team could find the back of the net in regular and extra time. Reyes missed a penalty, giving Leixões the win. Although Nuno Gomes was frustrated with the elimination, he said it was time to hold their heads high and win the league. On Thursday the 18th, Benfica closed their European campaign by hosting Metalist Kharkiv. To qualify, Benfica had to win 8–0 and Olympiacos not win; in case of a draw, Benfica needed a better goal average. They lost one-nil, finishing last in Group B. Sánchez Flores assumed full responsibility for his team's performance in the competition. Of 40 teams, only Partizan, Heerenveen and Feyenoord played worse than Benfica. The year ended with a home game against Nacional. Benfica never overcame Nacional goalkeeper Rafael Bracalli, wasting an opportunity to open a four-point lead in the league table. The match ended in controversy after Cardozo had a goal disallowed because Miguel Vítor had deflected the ball with his hands. According to Sánchez Flores, the goal was legitimate and Benfica were deprived of three points.|$|E
