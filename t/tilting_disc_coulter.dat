40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and peripapillary choroidal thickness in eyes with <b>tilted</b> optic <b>disc</b> {{in order to identify}} characteristic RNFL and peripapillary choroid patterns verified by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: Twenty-nine eyes of 29 patients with <b>tilted</b> optic <b>discs</b> were studied with spectral-domain (SD) -OCT and compared with age and sex-matched control subjects in a prospective design. The imaging of RNFL was performed using circular scans of a diameter of 3. 4 mm around the optic disc using OCT.

The present prospective study was aimed at assessing platelet P-selectin expression, platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation and platelet microparticles and comparing biological, bileaflet and <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> valvular prostheses in aortic position. METHODS: Thirty-three patients were included (15 bioprostheses, 11 bileaflet and 7 <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> mechanical valves).

40|$|The {{basic problem}} {{associated}} with no-till and minimum tillage seeding operations {{is the presence}} of crop residue on fields which does not get cut with the existing seeding machines. This failure to cut crop residue results in improper placement of seed. Special seeding machines have been designed, (e. g., Haybuster 1206 grain and fertilizer drill) to overcome these problems. These machines re­quire extra investment for farmers already having conventional seeding machines if they want to practice minimum and no-tilling farming. The study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the perfor­mance of <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> under zero-till practice in the soil bin under different soil conditions and to provide design criteria for modification of existing seed drills so that they could be used under no till conditions.

It is characterized by an abnormal convex macular contour within the concavity of a posterior staphyloma. We found DSM associated with serous macular detachment (SMD) and <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> in two consecutive cases. Case Reports: Case 1 : A 37 -year-old female presented to our department because of sudden onset blurred vision in her right eye (OD). The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0. 5 in both eyes. Funduscopy evidenced bilateral <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> associated with posterior staphyloma. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a DSM with SMD in her OD. After 15 months of follow-up, BCVA of her OD remained stable with chronic SMD. Case 2 : A 32 -year-old female presented to our department because of blurred vision in her OD. The BCVA was 0. 4 in the OD and 1. 0 in the left eye (OS). Bilateral <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> and posterior staphyloma were evidenced in the funduscopy.

40|$|Stand {{establishment}} of crops by direct drilling {{is a function}} of seed germination and seedling emergence efficacy and their interactions with the soil physical micro-environment created by direct drill coulters. Experiments conducted in two contrasting controlled climates using 0. 5 tonne undisturbed turf blocks suggested that the three coulter types compared (viz. an experimental chisel coulter, a hoe and a triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter)</b> performed significantly differently, in terms of wheat seedling emergence, when the seed was direct drilled into a fine sandy loam soil. Overall the chisel coulter promoted highest seedling emergence (63. 5 %) followed by the hoe coulter (50. 6 %) and the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> (27. 0 %). When the initial soil moisture potential was close to permanent wilting point, seedling emergence counts between these three coulters were highly significant with the difference between the chisel and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> being almost six-fold. When the initial soil moisture level was adequate, seedling emergence counts from the triple disc grooves, were Still significantly lower than from the chisel and hoe coulters which themselves performed equally. When the controlled relative humidity was increased from 60 % to 90 %, seedling emergence increased but this difference was significant only at a lower level of probability of P = 0. 10. Application of pressures (using press wheels) up to 70 kPa over the covered seeds after bar harrowing had no significant effect on seedling emergence at either the low or adequate initial soil moisture levels. When similar pressures were applied directly over the uncovered seeds, seedling emergence significantly increased to 60 % in the hoe coulter grooves and to 28 % in the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> grooves compared to the impressed seeds. No significant increase was observed from the chisel coulter groove {{as a result of these}} pressures because it had already promoted a high seedling emergence count of 58 %. Further experiments, using small undisturbed turf blocks, to examine more closely the poor performance of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter,</b> indicated that smearing had not been the main cause of seedling emergence failure. When the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> grooves were modified using combinations of pressure applications and seed covering techniques, seedling emergence was significantly improved. It appeared that this improvement in seedling emergence was a function of a modified soil physical micro-environment at the seed-soil interface. Based on these results two hypotheses were evolved. The first hypothesis suggested that the transfer of liquid soil moisture to the seed for germination (and perhaps away from the unprotected seedling after germination but prior to emergence) could be altered by the shape of the seed groove and placement and covering of the seed. This was described as "soil moisture diffusion" The second hypothesis suggested that after the germination, subterranean seedling survival depended on the availability of vapour phase moisture which was also a function of the groove shape and covering medium. This was described as "soil moisture captivity". A thermo-electric dew point hygrometer was used to measure the in-groove vapour moisture potential within the drilled grooves in the larger turf blocks, in a controlled environment. Significant and repeatable differences in the drying rates of the grooves created by the three coulter types were measured and promised to at least partly explain the underlying causes of their abilities (or lack of abilities in some cases) to promote seedling emergence. Combined counts of seedling emergence and sub-surface seedling survival were moderately correlated (r = 0. 71) with the corresponding rates of loss of in-groove soil vapour moisture. It appeared from the data that the important design characteristics for direct drilling coulters were that they must have the ability to both exploit the limited supply of sub-surface liquid moisture for germination and also retain soil moisture in the vapour form for seedling emergence and/or survival. The latter function appeared to be aided by the creation of minimum surface shattering and maintenance of a high incidence of surface mulch in the form of sod or organic matter. Field experiments suggested that when the only measured soil moisture data available was at or prior to drilling, the present state of knowledge would not permit accurate seedling emergence data to be predicted for any given coulter and covering technique. If however, soil moisture data was available for the period between drilling and seedling emergence, reasonable predictions of seedling emergence could be made, given the characteristics of the coulter types and covering techniques used. Examples of mathematical models were constructed for each of the three coulter types used, to predict seedling emergence as a function of these soil moisture data. The field experiments also confirmed that higher seedling emergence counts could be expected when the chisel coulter was used in dry soils compared with the hoe or triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters.</b> During a typical spring-summer-autumn period in the Manawatu, when wheat seed was direct-drilled at fortnightly intervals into a "Tokomaru silt loam soil"; from 16 % of the drillings the chisel coulter promoted significantly higher seedling emergence counts than either the hoe or triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the process}} of direct {{drilling}} different shaped drill coulters have been observed to create different micro-environments at the seed zone. This study has been to examine possible changes in soil structure {{and the state of}} soil compaction around the groove, which in turn might affect root penetration. Several methods and pieces of equipment were developed to investigate the influence on the soil of two contrasting coulter shapes. These were the commercially-available triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> and an experimental chisel coulter. To measure soil bulk density in the drilled groove zone, a small core sampler was designed and tested. Soil strength was assessed using a modified multi-point penetrometer which could be inserted vertically into the soil or normal to the groove walls. The instantaneous and permanent soil pressure zone of influence around the groove, which was created by the passing of the coulters, was monitored using a liquid-filled tube with a terminal diaphragm and a minipressure transducer. Macroscopic visual assessment of the compaction of soil at the seed level was undertaken using a freezing sampling technique which facilitated thin section subsamples to be studied by photographic techniques. In addition, 3 mm 3 subsamples were taken directly from the grooves for electron microscopy study. Supplementary measurements included draft force and the coulter-passage-disturbance-zone at the soil surface using a load cell and a displacement transducer respectively. Wheat and lupin seeds were sown to study the effects of soil changes on root growth of a fibrous and tap root system. The data suggested that the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> tended to compact well-defined zones around the groove while the chisel coulter produced no apparent compaction. Such soil compaction in a moist silt loam of initial bulk density less than 1. 1 g/cc did not result in any apparent differences in plant root responses between the two coulter types. In a drier, harder soil however (greater than 1. 32 g/cc) there appeared to be a clear disadvantage from use of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> in this respect. With lupin, root growth was restricted and deformed from use of the latter coulter, while in the case of wheat, seedling emergence was restricted in comparison with the chisel coulter. Smearing was found on the groove wall in moist soil with the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> but the experiments were not able to show any mechanical restriction to root and plant development arising from the smear. In the field conditions, in contrast to the laboratory conditions (where seedling performance and root growth were better with the chisel coulter in almost all of the tested conditions except with moist and loose soil where it was equivalent to the triple disc) any localised compaction of soil by the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> (particularly at and near the base of the groove) appeared to be compensated by other factors (weather, earthworms etc.) during the plant's full growth cycle. Compaction and mechanical impedance in isolation {{did not appear to be}} solely responsible for the root and plant growth responses. A physiological study of soil moisture transport process and soil water vapour availability in the seed zone should therefore be the subject of further studies...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis prospective-randomized study {{investigated}} the effect of aortic valve design and patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) on coronary flow reserve (CFR) after mechanical or biological aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). BackgroundCoronary flow reserve {{may be an important}} parameter of long-term survival after AVR in patients with AS. Reduced CFR may contribute to more cardiovascular events and greater rates of mortality. MethodsA total of 48 patients undergoing AVR underwent magnetic resonance imaging for the measurement of coronary flow preoperatively, 5 days postoperatively, and at 6 -month follow-up with measurement of CFR. Patients scheduled for mechanical AVR were randomized to a <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> or bileaflet prosthesis (n = 12 in each group). For biological AVR, patients were scheduled to receive a stented (n = 12) or stentless (n = 12) valve. Patients also underwent echocardiography with measurement of transvalvular pressure gradients and left ventricular mass regression. ResultsPostoperatively, coronary flow increased significantly in all groups (p < 0. 001). Only stentless valves demonstrated a normal CFR (3. 4 ± 0. 3 vs. 2. 3 ± 0. 1 for stented biological valves, 2. 1 ± 0. 2 for <b>tilting</b> <b>disc,</b> and 2. 2 ± 0. 3 for bileaflet mechanical valves). Patient-prosthesis mismatch with an indexed effective orifice area < 0. 85 cm 2 /m 2 led to decreased rates of CFR in the <b>tilting</b> <b>disc,</b> stentless, and stented groups.

Patients: Mechanical valves (six <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> valves and two bileaflet valves) were implanted in eight patients previously operated on for tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7) and truncus arteriosus (n = 1), with severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by massive pulmonary regurgitation. Results: All patients survived prosthesis implantation and are currently well. At follow-up (3 months to 9 years), they do not show signs of valve failure, and right ventricular function has dramatically improved in all but one, who still shows moderate ventricular hypokinesia.

Observations of circumstellar gas surrounding the mass donor in RS Vul suggest magnetic effects could be responsible for deflecting the accretion stream out of the orbital plane, resulting in a <b>tilted</b> <b>disc.</b> To determine whether a <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> is possible due to a deflected stream, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the mass transfer process in RS Vul. By deflecting the stream 45 ◦ out of the orbital plane and boosting the magnitude of the stream’s velocity to Mach 30, we mimic the effects of magnetic activity near L 1. We find that the modified stream parameters change the direct-impact nature of the system. The stream misses the surface of the star, and a slightly warped accretion disc forms with no more than 3 ◦ of <b>disc</b> <b>tilt.</b> The stream-disc interaction for the deflected stream forces a large degree of material above the orbital plane, increasing the out-of-plane flow drastically. Plotting the Hα emissivity in velocity space allows us to compare our results with tomographic observations. Deflecting and boosting the stream increases the emissivity in each vz slice of the out-of-plane flow by at least three and up to eight orders of magnitude compared to the undeflected case.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the degree of LV mass regression measured by MRI 6 months after prospectively randomized valve implantation for two biological prostheses, stented and stentless, and for two mechanical valves, <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> and bileaflet. 2060...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 40 -year-old woman whose Sorin <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> mitral {{prosthesis}} was obstructed by fibrous overgrowth to the point of near occlusion. The unusual features of this case are that the patient survived reoperation and that her preoperative symptoms were mild despite an immobile disc and near occlusion of the valve. In most similar cases in the literature, preoperative symptoms have been acute and mortality has been high...|$|R
40|$|In Montgomery (2009 a), we {{show that}} {{accretion}} discs in binary systems could retrogradely precess by tidal torques like the Moon and the Sun on a tilted, spinning, non-spherical Earth. In addition, {{we show that}} the state of matter and the geometrical shape of the celestial object could significantly affect the precessional value. For example, a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) Dwarf Novae (DN) non-magnetic system that shows negative superhumps in its light curve can be described by a retrogradely precessing, differentially rotating, <b>tilted</b> <b>disc.</b> Because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the <b>tilted</b> <b>disc</b> and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli, coupled to the disc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the innermost annuli of the disc. However, numerical simulations by Bisikalo et al. (2003, 2004) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be generated instead of an inner ring. Therefore, we show that retrograde precession in non-magnetic, spinning, tilted CV DN systems can equally be described by a retrogradely precessing and differentially rotating disc with an attached retrogradely precessing inner spiral density wave so long as the wave appears at the same radius as the ring and within the plane of the <b>tilted</b> <b>disc.</b> We find that the theoretical results generated in this work agree well with the theoretical results presented in Montgomery (2009 a) and thus with the numerical simulations and select CV DN systems in Montgomery (2009 b) that may have a main sequence secondary. Therefore, pressure effects do need to be considered in CV DN systems that exhibit negative superhumps if the accretion <b>discs</b> are <b>tilted</b> and have an inner spiral density wave that is in the plane of the disc...|$|R
30|$|Peripapillary CNV {{has certain}} unique {{features}} compared to its macular counterpart. First, peripapillary CNV is associated {{not just with}} diseases affecting chorioretinal tissue adjacent to the disc but also with diseases affecting the optic nerve head. For example, peripapillary CNV {{can be seen in}} optic disc drusen, congenital <b>disc</b> anomalies, <b>tilted</b> <b>disc,</b> and disc swelling [4]. Second, peripapillary CNV may develop from the breakthrough of abnormal choroidal blood vessels through Bruch's membrane in addition to growth of vessels around the termination of Bruch's membrane [2 – 4]. Third, the occurrence of clinical symptoms prior to the extension of the lesion into the fovea may allow detection and treatment of these lesions with potentially more favorable visual outcomes compared to their foveal counterparts [4].|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{evaluating}} the techniques and equipment used for direct drilling of seeds into untilled soils were reviewed and developed. Field tests {{were used to}} highlight seedling establishment problems and were complimented by a tillage bin technique which sought to isolate variables such as climate, soil type and soil moisture regime. The tillage bin technique involved collecting half-tonne undisturbed blocks of turf in open ended steel bins using a special turf cutting machine. These tillage bins were subjected to a common climate and moisture supply by placing them beneath transparent rain canopies and applying water artificially. Drilling utilized a support bed on which several bins were placed end to end and which was straddled by a moving gantry and tool testing apparatus operating on rails alongside. This facility allowed close visual appraisal {{to be made of}} the action of coulters and seed deposition and was operated at speeds which were infinitely variable, within limits. Seed metering was precisely controlled and selected coulter forces and soil physical properties were measured with the apparatus. Turf blocks, in their tillage bins, were returned to the rain protection canopies after drilling for plant response studies. Soil cover over the seed appeared to be important in promoting seedling emergence. Field covering devices were evaluated and a bar harrow was developed and adopted as a standard covering procedure. The importance of covering the seed appeared to be more pronounced with large seeds such as maize and barley than with smaller seeds such as lucerne. A strong relationship between visual scoring of the amount and type of cover, and seedling emergence data was established. This favoured covering media with a predominance of unbroken dead pasture mulch, compared with loose soil and rubble. The performances of a range of drill coulters operating at slow speeds in association with the bar harrow, were compared in terms of plant responses under soil moisture stress. An experimental chisel coulter was developed to obviate the noted shortcomings of some of these existing coulters. In contrast to the "V" shaped grooves left by most coulters, the chisel confined most of its soil disturbance to sub surface layers, with a narrow opening at the surface. With all coulters, seed germination appeared to be less affected by coulter design than seedling emergence because of sub surface mortality of seedlings. In this respect clear seedling emergence responses favoured the chisel coulter. Maximum wheat seedling emergence with the chisel coulter assembly was 77 %, which was significantly greater than hoe and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> with 27 % and 26 % respectively. As the initial soil moisture level was raised in other experiments the magnitude of these differences decreased but the order of ranking remained. A 22 % comparative decrease in initial soil moisture content was necessary to reduce the performance of the chisel coulter to a similar level to that of the hoe and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters.</b> Difficulty was experienced in accurately monitoring in-groove soil moisture regimes, but irrigation responses and gravimetric determinations of sub samples suggested that the ability of grooves to retain available soil moisture was a critical factor in the plant emergence responses. Soil temperatures appeared not to be greatly affected by coulter type in these experiments although the in-groove minimum temperature with the chisel coulter was significantly higher than the hoe and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> in one experiment. Observation of the modes of action of coulters showed that the chisel and hoe coulters produced some upward soil heaving while the triple disc appeared to operate with a downward and outward wedging action in the soil. An increase in soil density under the groove resulted from passage of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> but no effect on density was seen with the chisel or hoe coulters. The down forces required for 38 mm penetration of all coulters tested, appeared also to be closely related to their modes of action and relatively insensitive to soil moisture content in the stress range. In this respect the triple disc required 1. 4 times more force than the dished <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> and from 2. 3 to 4. 6 times more force than a range of 4 other coulters. Field tests of the wear rates of chisel coulters constructed of various steel based materials, with and without hardening treatments, suggested a number of preferred treatments but could not establish any difference in wear rate from coulters operating in the tractor wheel marks compared with those operating in unmarked soil...|$|R
40|$|Sixty <b>tilted</b> <b>discs</b> {{were studied}} by colour photography, {{including}} some by fluorescein angiography. Attention {{was drawn to}} the contracted, D-shaped outline of the scleral canal, and it was suggested that fewer fibres than normal enter the defective side of the disc. This was supported by examination of the nerve fibre layer and the discovery of field defects in 13 of the 27 eyes in which the visual fields were examined. The similarity of these features with congenital hypoplasia of the optic nerve head was noted...|$|R
50|$|Strong {{evidence}} of <b>tilted</b> <b>discs</b> {{is seen in}} the systems Her X-1, SMC X-1, and SS 433 (among others), where a periodic line-of-sight blockage of X-ray emissions is seen on the order of 50-200 days; much slower than the systems' binary orbit of ~1 day. The periodic blockage is believed to result from precession of a circumprimary or circumbinary disc, which normally occurs retrograde to the binary orbit {{as a result of the}} same differential torque which creates spiral density waves in an axissymmetric disc.|$|R

Most MHV investigated generate cavitation only when the dP/dt is well above the physiological range. However investigations have found that several <b>tilting</b> <b>disc</b> valves and only one bileaflet valve, the Edwards-Duromedics, generate cavitation within the physiological range. Investigations have repeatedly demonstrated that bileaflet valves, {{with the exception of the}} Edwards Duramedics design, cavitate only at dP/dt levels well above the physiological range.|$|R
40|$|Absent {{pulmonary}} valve syndrome (APVS) {{is a rare}} congenital heart disease. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with APVS is a rare {{variation of}} TOF. These patients are commonly cyanotic at birth. Respiratory complaints predominate due to airway compression by dilated pulmonary arteries. Commonest age of presentation is infancy with anecdotal adult case-reports. Surgical treatment requires establishing unobstructed competent right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) often with monocusp or conduits.
