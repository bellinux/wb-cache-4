50|$|All machine tapers are {{sensitive}} to chips, nicks (dents), and dirt. They will not locate accurately, and the self-holding variety will not hold reliably, if such problems interfere with the seating of the male into the female with firm contact over the whole conical surface. Machinists are trained on keeping tapers clean and handling them in ways that prevent them from being nicked by other tools. CNC tool-changing cycles usually include a compressed-air blast while one <b>toolholder</b> is being swapped with the next. The air blast tends to blow away chips that might otherwise end up interfering between the <b>toolholder</b> and spindle.|$|E
50|$|Micromanipulators {{are usually}} used in {{conjunction}} with microscopes. Depending on the application, one or more micromanipulators may be fitted to a microscope stage or rigidly mounted to a bench next to a microscope. A typical application of micromanipulation is human intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Here, a spermatozoon measuring some 3 to 5 micrometres across is injected into an oocyte of approximately 100 micrometres in diameter, under the direct manual control of an embryologist. A disposable glass micropipette is fitted to a <b>toolholder</b> mounted on the output of the manipulator. The <b>toolholder</b> can be adjusted for different sized tools as well as the angle at which the tool is held.|$|E
50|$|A drawbar or spindle drawbar is a {{clamping}} mechanism for toolholders on machine tools. The <b>toolholder</b> or machine taper itself {{is held by}} the drawbar and applies force to the spindle, especially when spinning at low speeds.|$|E

Further deals with division and description of {{some types of}} mechanism tooling tool in <b>toolholders,</b> their construction and using...|$|R
5000|$|HSK <b>toolholders</b> were {{developed}} in the early 1990s. HSK stands for Hohlschaftkegel; German for [...] "hollow shank taper".|$|R
5000|$|A {{machine taper}} {{is a system}} for {{securing}} cutting tools or <b>toolholders</b> in the spindle of a machine tool or power tool. A male member of conical form (that is, with a [...] ) fits into the female socket, which has a matching taper of equal angle.|$|R
50|$|The {{toolpost}} is {{the part}} of a metalworking lathe which either holds the tool bit directly or holds a <b>toolholder</b> which contains the tool bit. There are a great variety of designs for toolposts (including basic toolposts, rocker toolposts, quick-change toolposts, and toolpost turrets) and toolholders (with varying geometry and features).|$|E
5000|$|Shapers, slotters, and planers often {{employ a}} kind of <b>toolholder</b> called a clapper box that swings freely on the return stroke of the ram or bed. On the next cutting stroke, it [...] "claps" [...] back into cutting position. Its {{movement}} is analogous {{to that of a}} butterfly-style check valve.|$|E
50|$|Unlike hand tools, a tool in numerically (digitally) {{controlled}} machines {{is composed}} of several parts, such as the cutting tool (which may be one piece or comprise a body plus indexable inserts), a collet, and a <b>toolholder</b> with a machine taper. Putting the parts together accurately into an assembly is required to achieve error-free production.|$|E
50|$|Some {{machines}} use smaller <b>toolholders</b> MK2 (Morse taper #2 - {{on older}} machines), ISO-30, HSK-63 or the tools just get {{held in a}} collet tool holder affixed directly to the spindle nose. ISO-30 and HSK-63 are rapid-change toolholding systems. HSK-63 has begun to supplant the ISO-30 as the rapid change standard in recent years.|$|R

50|$|ISO 13399 (Cutting tool data {{representation}} and exchange) {{is an international}} technical standard by ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) for the computer-interpretable representation and exchange of industrial product data about cutting tools and <b>toolholders.</b> The objective {{is to provide a}} mechanism capable of describing product data regarding cutting tools, independent from any particular system. The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange (free of proprietary format constraints), but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving, regarding cutting tools.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more modern}} <b>toolholder</b> designs {{became known as}} the Caterpillar [...] "V-Flange", CAT, V-Flange, ANSI B5.50, SK, ISO, International (INT), BT, ISO 7388-1, DIN 69871, NFE 62540. Once again, there are slight {{variations}} in the tooling. Although the basic taper dimensions are the same, there are differences are in the flanges, draw-in thread sizes, and pull studs; the international versions use metric sizes.|$|E
50|$|The various angles, shapes, {{and sizes}} of a {{single-point cutting tool}} have direct {{relation}} to the resulting surface of a workpiece in machining operations. Different types of angle such as rake angle, side rake angle, cutting-edge angle, relief angle, nose radius exist and may be different {{with respect to the}} workpiece. Also, there are many shapes of single-point cutting tools, such as V-shaped and Square. Usually, a special <b>toolholder</b> is used to hold the cutting tool firmly during operation.|$|E
50|$|For {{production}} machine tools, the shank type is usually {{one of the}} following: a standard taper (such as Morse or Brown & Sharpe), a straight round shank to be held by a collet, or a straight round shank with a flat for a set screw, to be held by a solid <b>toolholder.</b> For hand tools, the shank end is usually a square drive, intended for use with {{the same type of}} wrench used to turn a tap for the cutting of screw threads.|$|E
5000|$|The HSK {{design was}} {{developed}} as a nonproprietary standard. The working group that produced the HSK standard consisted of representatives from academia, the Association of German Tool Manufacturing {{and a group of}} international companies and end users. The results were the German DIN standards 69063 for the spindle and 69893 for the shank.The HSK working group did not adopt a specific product design, but rather a set of standards that defined HSK <b>toolholders</b> for different applications. The group defined a total of six HSK shank forms, in 9 sizes.|$|R
50|$|Machine tool {{builders}} {{have long}} had trade associations, which have helped with such tasks as establishing industry standards, lobbying (of legislatures and, more often, import-and-export-regulating agencies), and training programs. For example, the National Machine Tool Builders' Association (NMTBA) was the trade association of U.S. machine tool builders for many decades, {{and it helped}} establish standards such as the NMTB machine taper series (which made <b>toolholders</b> interchangeable between the different brands of machine on a typical machine shop floor). It has since been merged into the Association for Manufacturing Technology (AMT). Other examples have included CECIMO (European Machine Tool Industry Association), the UK's ABMTM, MTTA, and MTA, and the Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association (JMTBA).|$|R
50|$|An {{improvement}} on CAT Tooling is BT Tooling, which looks similar and {{can easily be}} confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes {{in a range of}} sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT tooling is symmetrical about the spindle axis, which CAT tooling is not. This gives BT tooling greater stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these two <b>toolholders</b> is the thread used to hold the pull stud. CAT Tooling is all Imperial thread and BT Tooling is all Metric thread. Note that this affects the pull stud only, it does not affect the tool that they can hold, both types of tooling are sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or <b>toolholder</b> shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|E
5000|$|NMTB is a [...] "self releasing" [...] or [...] "fast" [...] taper. Unlike {{the more}} acute self holding tapers above, such tapers are not {{designed}} to transmit high torque; high torques are carried by driving keys engaging slots on the flange. The purpose is to allow a quick and easy change between different tools (either automatically or by hand) while ensuring the tool or <b>toolholder</b> will be tightly and rigidly connected to the spindle, and accurately coaxial with it. The larger end adjacent to the tool makes for more rigidity than is possible with Morse or RT tapers fitted to comparable machines.|$|E
50|$|The {{turret lathe}} {{is a form}} of {{metalworking}} lathe that is used for repetitive production of duplicate parts, which by the nature of their cutting process are usually interchangeable. It evolved from earlier lathes with the addition of the turret, which is an indexable <b>toolholder</b> that allows multiple cutting operations to be performed, each with a different cutting tool, in easy, rapid succession, with no need for the operator to perform set-up tasks in between, such as installing or uninstalling tools, nor to control the toolpath. The latter is due to the toolpath's being controlled by the machine, either in jig-like fashion, via the mechanical limits placed on it by the turret's slide and stops, or via electronically-directed servomechanisms for computer numerical control lathes.|$|E
50|$|Simple CNC {{machines}} {{work with}} a single tool. Turrets can {{work with a}} large number of tools. But if even more tools are required, then ATC is provided. The tools are stored on a magazine. It allows the machine to work {{with a large number}} of tools without an operator. The main parts of an automatic tool changer are the base, the gripper arm, the tool holder, the support arm and tool magazines. Although the ATC increases the reliability, speed and accuracy, it creates more challenges compared to manual tool change, for example the tooling used must be easy to centre, be easy for the changer to grab and there should be a simple way to provide the tool's self-disengagement. Tools used in ATC are secured in <b>toolholders</b> specially designed for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{workpiece}} mounts on a rigid, box-shaped {{table in}} front of the machine. The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram. Table motion may be controlled manually, but is usually advanced by an automatic feed mechanism acting on the feedscrew. The ram slides back and forth above the work. At {{the front end of the}} ram is a vertical tool slide that may be adjusted to either side of the vertical plane along the stroke axis. This tool-slide holds the clapper box [...] and tool post, from which the tool can be positioned to cut a straight, flat surface on the top of the workpiece. The tool-slide permits feeding the tool downwards to deepen a cut. This adjustability, coupled with the use of specialized cutters and <b>toolholders,</b> enable the operator to cut internal and external gear tooth ...|$|R
50|$|Non-IT-assisted {{physical}} guidance was {{the first}} means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age. It is achieved by jigs, fixtures, and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by {{the very nature of}} their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are , the turrets on manual turret lathes, indexing heads for manual milling machines, rotary tables, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than indexing heads, and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops. Although indexing heads of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine <b>toolholders</b> or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flexibility}} {{is also used}} to provide accurate axial location. An HSK <b>toolholder</b> has both a tapered shank, and a flange with a mating surface. The shank is short (about half as long as other machine tapers), with a shallow taper (a ratio of 1:10), and slightly too large to allow the flange to seat fully in the socket. The thin walls, short shank and shallow taper provide a large opening {{in the back of the}} tool. An expanding collet fits in there, and mates with 30° chamfer inside the shank. As the drawbar retracts, it expands the collet and pulls the shank back into the socket, compressing the shank until the flange seats against the front of the socket. This provides a stiff, repeatable connection ...|$|E
5000|$|Turret lathes and capstan lathes {{are members}} of a class of lathes that are used for {{repetitive}} production of duplicate parts (which by the nature of their cutting process are usually interchangeable). It evolved from earlier lathes with the addition of the turret, which is an indexable <b>toolholder</b> that allows multiple cutting operations to be performed, each with a different cutting tool, in easy, rapid succession, with no need for the operator to perform setup tasks in between (such as installing or uninstalling tools) nor to control the toolpath.

50|$|An HSK {{connection}} {{depends on}} a combination of axial clamping forces and taper-shank interference. All these forces are generated and controlled by the mating components’ design parameters. The shank and spindle both must have precisely mating tapers and faces that are square to the taper’s axis. There are several HSK clamping methods. All use some mechanism to amplify the clamping action of equally spaced collet segments. When the <b>toolholder</b> is clamped into the spindle, the drawbar force produces a firm metal-to-metal contact between the shank and the ID of the clamping unit. An additional application of drawbar force positively locks the two elements together into a joint {{with a high level of}} radial and axial rigidity. As the collet segments rotate, the clamping mechanism gains centrifugal force. The HSK design actually harnesses centrifugal force to increase joint strength. Centrifugal force also causes the thin walls of the shank to deflect radially at a faster rate than the walls of the spindle. This contributes to a secure connection by guaranteeing strong contact between the shank and the spindle. The automotive and aerospace industries are the largest users of HSK toolholders. Another industry that is seeing increasing use is the mold and die industry.|$|E
50|$|When {{electric}} motors started to become {{common in the}} early 20th century, many cone-head lathes were converted to electric power. At {{the same time the}} state of the art in gear and bearing practice was advancing to the point that manufacturers began to make fully geared headstocks, using gearboxes analogous to automobile transmissions to obtain various spindle speeds and feed rates while transmitting the higher amounts of power needed to take full advantage of high speed steel tools. Cutting tools evolved once again, with the introduction of man made carbides,and became widely introduced to general industry in the 1970s. Early carbides were attached <b>toolholders</b> by brazing them into a machined 'nest' in the tool holders, later designs allowed tips to be replaceable, and multi faceted, allowing them to be reused. Carbides tolerate much higher machining speeds without wearing. This has led to machining times shortening, and therefore production growing. The demand for faster and more powerful lathes controlled the direction of lathe development. The availability of inexpensive electronics has again changed the way speed control may be applied by allowing continuously variable motor speed from the maximum down to almost zero RPM. This had been tried in the late 19th century but was not found satisfactory at the time. Subsequent improvements in electric circuitry have made it viable again.|$|R
40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of Internet-based architectures is allowing an efficient {{access to information}} resources over geographically dispersed areas. This fact is exerting {{a major influence on}} current manufacturing practices. Business activities involving customers, partners, employees and suppliers are being rapidly and efficiently integrated through networked information management environments. Therefore, efforts are required to take advantage of distributed infrastructures that can satisfy information integration and collaborative work strategies in corporate environments. In this research, Internet-based distributed solutions focused on the manufacturing industry are proposed. Three different systems have been developed for the tooling sector, specifically for the company Seco Tools UK Ltd (industrial collaborator). They are summarised as follows. SELTOOL is a Web-based open tool selection system involving the analysis of technical criteria to establish appropriate selection of inserts, <b>toolholders</b> and cutting data for turning, threading and grooving operations. It has been oriented to world-wide Seco customers. SELTOOL provides an interactive and crossed-way of searching for tooling parameters, rather than conventional representation schemes provided by catalogues. Mechanisms were developed to filter, convert and migrate data from different formats to the database (SQL-based) used by SELTOOL. TTS (Tool Trials System) is a Web-based system developed by the author and two other researchers to support Seco sales engineers and technical staff, who would perform tooling trials in geographically dispersed machining centres and benefit from sharing data and results generated by these tests. Through TTS tooling engineers (authorised users) can submit and retrieve highly specific technical tooling data for both milling and turning operations. Moreover, it is possible for tooling engineers to avoid the execution of new tool trials knowing the results of trials carried out in physically distant places, when another engineer had previously executed these trials. The system incorporates encrypted security features suitable for restricted use on the World Wide Web. An urgent need exists for tools to make sense of raw data, extracting useful knowledge from increasingly large collections of data now being constructed and made available from networked information environments. This {{explosive growth}} in the availability of information is overwhelming the capabilities of traditional information management systems, to provide efficient ways of detecting anomalies and significant patterns in large sets of data. Inexorably, the tooling industry is generating valuable experimental data. It is a potential and unexplored sector regarding the application of knowledge capturing systems. Hence, to address this issue, a knowledge discovery system called DISKOVER was developed. DISKOVER is an integrated Java-application consisting of five data mining modules, able to be operated through the Internet. Kluster and Q-Fast are two of these modules, entirely developed by the author. Fuzzy-K has been developed by the author in collaboration with another research student in the group at Durham. The final two modules (R-Set and MQG) have been developed by another member of the Durham group. To develop Kluster, a complete clustering methodology was proposed. Kluster is a clustering application able to combine the analysis of quantitative as well as categorical data (conceptual clustering) to establish data classification processes. This module incorporates two original contributions. Specifically, consistent indicators to measure the quality of the final classification and application of optimisation methods to the final groups obtained. Kluster provides the possibility, to users, of introducing case-studies to generate cutting parameters for particular Input requirements. Fuzzy-K is an application having the advantages of hierarchical clustering, while applying fuzzy membership functions to support the generation of similarity measures. The implementation of fuzzy membership functions helped to optimise the grouping of categorical data containing missing or imprecise values. As the tooling database is accessed through the Internet, which is a relatively slow access platform, it was decided to rely on faster Information retrieval mechanisms. Q-fast is an SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) application, Implemented for this purpose...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1800 and 1840, on the machine-screw side, {{it became}} common {{practice}} to build {{all of the}} relevant screw-cutting machine elements into engine lathes, so the term [...] "screw-cutting lathe" [...] ceased to stand in contradistinction to other metalworking lathe types as a [...] "special" [...] kind of lathe. Meanwhile, on the wood-screw side, hardware manufacturers had developed for their own in-house use the first fully automatic automated special-purpose machine tools for the making of screws. The 1760-1840 development arc was a tremendous technological advance, but later advancements would make screws even cheaper and more prevalent yet again. These began in the 1840s with the adaptation of the engine lathe with a turret-head <b>toolholder</b> to create the turret lathe. This development greatly reduced the time, effort, and skill needed from the machine operator to produce each machine screw. Single-pointing was forgone in favor of die head cutting for such medium- and high-volume repetitive production. Then, in the 1870s, the turret lathe's part-cutting cycle (sequence of movements) was automated by being put under cam control, in a way very similar to how music boxes and player pianos can play a tune automatically. According to Rolt (1965), {{the first person to}} develop such a machine was Christopher Miner Spencer, a New England inventor. [...] may have contemporarily independently invented a machine similar to Spencer's. However, the wood-screw-making machines of the 1840s and 1850s factory production machine tools as opposed to small-machine-shop machine tools, such as those developed by Cullen Whipple of the New England Screw Company and Thomas J. Sloan of the American Screw Company, had anticipated the machines of Spencer and Vander Woerd in various ways, albeit approaching the problem of automated screw production from a different commercial angle. All of the above machine tools (i.e., screw-cutting lathes; suitably equipped engine lathes and bench lathes; turret lathes; turret-lathe-derived screw machines; and wood-screw-factory screw machines) were sometimes called [...] "screw machines" [...] during this era (logically enough, given that they were machines tailored to screw making). The nomenclatural evolution whereby the term [...] "screw machine" [...] is often used more narrowly than that is discussed above.|$|E

40|$|To {{position}} (without experiencing friction or play) a clamped tool in x-, z- and psi-direction on the Lifrel, a Philips diamond turning machine, an aluminium <b>toolholder</b> {{has been}} designed. The <b>toolholder</b> has {{a stroke of}} +- 0. 5 mm in x- and z- and +- 1 degreesC in psi-direction with an accuracy of respectively 0. 25 microm and 0. 1 degreesC. Positioning can be done manually using the intuitive mechanism with differential micrometers. The mechanism contains a virtual point of rotation, providing translation-free tooltip rotation. Applying this <b>toolholder</b> in combination with a converging adjustment procedure reduces the adjustment time from a two day to a two hour maximum. During machining the desired position is fixed using a clamp, which improves the stiffness and natural frequency. Displacement information for tool positioning on the Lifrel comes from the differential micrometerscale and from measuring a product copy. Applying the <b>toolholder</b> on a more accurate machine requires displacement sensors. Some groove structures made with two tools require a depth variation in or in between grooves. A closed-loop piezo-driven small-stroke module with a profile tool, added to the <b>toolholder,</b> establishes a 10 microm depth variation {{with respect to the}} reference tool at a machining frequency of 50 Hz. An additional encoder attached to the drum, provides necessary position information. A second <b>toolholder</b> is used to position the reference tool...|$|E

40|$|This work treats of {{a cooling}} system for cutting tool in turning based in a <b>toolholder</b> with cooling fluid flowing inside its body being that this fluid must {{necessarily}} {{be able to}} phase change due to heat generated from machining processes. In this way the fluid evaporates just under the cutting tool allowing a heat transfer more efficient than if were used a fluid without phase change once the {{latent heat of evaporation}} is beneficial for removal heat. Following, the cooling fluid evaporated passes through a condenser located out of the <b>toolholder</b> where it is condensated and returns to the <b>toolholder</b> again and a new cycle is started. In this study the R- 123, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) fluid, was selected for the turning of a Cr-Ni-Nb-Mn-N austenitic steel of hard machinability. As result, the developed system allows a tool life equal to or better than the conventional cutting fluid method, moreover there are environmental and economics advantages once the cooling fluid is maintained in a loop circuit. ...|$|E
