5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. <b>The</b> <b>charred</b> litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{reactivity of}} <b>the</b> <b>chars</b> from both raw and torrefied wood, grape marc, and macroalgae {{has been investigated}} in this paper. <b>The</b> variations in <b>char</b> gasification reactivity were explained using further investigation of the physicochemical characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>char</b> that can influence the gasification reactivity, i. e., specific surface area, uniformity of the carbonaceous structure, and concentration of alkali metals (Na and K).

For a pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, the gasification reactivity of <b>the</b> <b>chars</b> from both <b>the</b> torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae was lower than that of <b>the</b> <b>chars</b> from their corresponding raw fuels.

40|$|Thermal pre-treatment, or torrefaction, is {{a process}} that can improve the {{handling}} and grinding properties of biomass for combustion and co-firing. This paper compares the combustion properties of raw and torrefied Short Rotation Coppice Willow (SRC), with those of typical bituminous power station coals. The fuels were analysed using a number of standard fuel characterisation tests. Willow SRC was torrefied at 290 Â Â°C for two reaction times (10 Â min (short) and 60 Â min (long)). During torrefaction, longer reaction time promotes loss of nitrogen from <b>the</b> solid product. <b>Chars</b> were produced from the fuels under high heating rates up to 1000 Â Â°C and <b>the</b> <b>char</b> yields and nitrogen partitioning were determined. Results show that the nitrogen partitioning for both raw and torrefied biomass favours release of nitrogen into the volatiles during rapid pyrolysis. In contrast, rapid pyrolysis of the coals favours nitrogen retention in <b>the</b> <b>char.</b> <b>The</b> <b>chars</b> were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) combustion tests, which were used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>char</b> reactivities and fate of <b>char</b> nitrogen. <b>The</b> <b>char</b> reactivities follow <b>the</b> order coal charÂ <Â torrefied willow charÂ <Â raw willow <b>char.</b> <b>The</b> release of volatile-nitrogen species during char combustion occurs at higher temperatures for <b>the</b> torrefied willow <b>chars</b> compared to <b>the</b> raw willow <b>chars</b> due to their relatively lower reactivities.

40|$|Utilization {{of biomass}} as an energy source {{is likely to}} {{increase}} in the near future. One way to recover energy from biomass is via gasification, which enables the production of electricity, heat, chemicals, or fuels such as synthetic natural gas or gasoline. The desired product from gasification is synthesis gas, which is a mixture of CO and H 2; however by-products such as tar and <b>char</b> are formed. <b>The</b> tars must be decomposed or removed, as they can cause clogging in downstream equipment. Tars are most commonly decomposed catalytically or thermally. However, thermal decomposition requires high temperatures, and catalyst deactivation takes place during catalytic decomposition. This thesis focuses on <b>the</b> utilization of <b>char</b> as a catalyst for tar decomposition. Char has a surface area that is higher than many typical catalysts, and contains catalytic minerals and metals which are well dispersed on <b>the</b> surface. Using <b>char</b> in this application would eliminate the need for purchasing expensive catalysts, and deactivation would not be a concern since deactivated char could be easily replaced by fresh char which is produced inside the gasifier. In addition, it provides a useful application for <b>the</b> <b>char,</b> which would otherwise be considered to be a low value product. In this work, poplar wood was gasified in a fluidized bed reactor under steam and CO 2 at 550, 750, and 920 C for different periods of time. <b>The</b> <b>char</b> was recovered from the fluidized bed, and its properties were studied. The BET surface area of <b>the</b> <b>char</b> ranged from 429 - 687 m^ 2 g^- 1 and increased with increasing gasification temperature or time. In addition, micropores were observed in char that was made in CO 2, but not in char that was made in steam. Gasification was also done in an ESEM under air, steam, and CO 2. ESEM results showed sintering of the metals and minerals on <b>the</b> <b>char</b> surface during gasification in air and steam, but sintering was not observed during gasification with CO 2. This showed that <b>the</b> properties of <b>char</b> depend on <b>the</b> gasification conditions. Catalytic activity of <b>the</b> <b>char</b> was demonstrated for decomposition of methane, propane, and toluene, which is a major component of gasification tar. The light off temperature for methane decomposition using a char catalyst was 100 C lower than the light off temperature when a commercial Pt/Al 2 CO 3 catalyst was used. Higher surface area char had higher catalytic activity. However, microporous char had lower catalytic activity than non-microporous char with a similar surface area, indicating that diffusion limitations occur in the micropores, reducing access to these catalytic sites. Deactivation was observed during catalytic cracking of CH 4. A 20 % reduction in surface area and 33 % reduction in mesopore volume were observed when comparing <b>the</b> used <b>char</b> catalyst to <b>the</b> fresh sample. This indicates that deactivation occurs via pore blocking. Kinetic analysis of the data showed a steeper deactivation function for mesoporous char that was made in H 2 O compared to microporous char that was made in CO 2. A steeper deactivation function is indicative of a higher number of catalyst sites per pore, since once a pore becomes blocked all of the catalytic sites within the pore will become inaccessible. Therefore, char made in steam, which is mesoporous, has more accessible catalyst sites per pore. <b>The</b> <b>char</b> morphology influences its catalytic activity, which increases with increasing accessible surface area. The accessible surface area of <b>the</b> <b>char</b> depends on both the surface area and the porosity of <b>the</b> <b>char.</b> Carbon based materials such as chars have been used in low temperature catalytic applications. In these applications, the catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of oxygen groups on the surface. Therefore, in this thesis the role of oxygen groups in the catalytic activity of <b>the</b> <b>char</b> for high temperature applications was investigated. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was used to identify the types of oxygen groups on <b>the</b> <b>char</b> surface and both acidic (lactone, carboxylic) and basic (pyrone, quinone) groups were identified. There {{were no significant differences in}} the concentration and type of surface oxygen groups amongst <b>the</b> different <b>char</b> samples. In order to understand the role that these compounds play in the catalytic activity of <b>the</b> <b>char,</b> oxygen was added to the surface of a char sample via nitric acid treatment and its catalytic performance was compared to <b>the</b> raw <b>char.</b> However, when <b>the</b> sample was heated in nitrogen to the reaction temperature (850 C) prior to utilization for methane decomposition, the oxygen groups desorbed, and the catalytic activity of <b>the</b> oxygenated <b>char</b> was <b>the</b> same as <b>the</b> raw <b>char.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>char</b> has catalytic activity even when the acidic surface oxygen groups have been removed. The role of metals in the catalytic activity of <b>the</b> <b>char</b> was studied. Metals were removed via acid washing, and the catalytic activity of <b>the</b> acid washed <b>char</b> was compared to <b>the</b> untreated <b>char.</b> <b>The</b> catalytic activity of <b>the</b> acid washed <b>char</b> was 19 % lower than <b>the</b> untreated <b>char,</b> which demonstrated that the presence of metals increases the catalytic activity of <b>the</b> <b>char.</b> <b>The</b> metals were found to be dispersed on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>char.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>char</b> was heated to 1000 C, and was then used to catalyze the decomposition of CH 4, the catalytic activity of <b>the</b> <b>char</b> was lower than the untreated sample. Therefore, the gasification process preserves the high dispersion of inorganic elements in <b>the</b> <b>char,</b> which improves <b>the</b> catalytic performance of <b>the</b> <b>char.</b> Char is often considered to be a by-product of gasification processes. However, this work has shown that char is a valuable product that has the potential to be used in catalytic applications.
