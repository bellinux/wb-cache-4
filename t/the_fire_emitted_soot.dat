The subsequent cleanup used diesel equipment that further polluted the air until the following June. The particulate air pollutants contained mutagenic and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). By using an assay developed for archived samples of fine particles, we measured nine PAHs in 243 samples collected at or near Ground Zero from September 23, 2001, to March 27, 2002. Based on temporal trends of individual PAH levels, we differentiated between fire and diesel sources and predicted PAH levels between 3 and 200 d after the disaster. Predicted PAH air concentrations on September 14, 2001, ranged from 1. 3 to 15 ng/m 3; these values are among the highest reported from outdoor sources. We infer that these high initial air concentrations resulted from fires that rapidly diminished over 100 d. Diesel sources predominated for the next 100 d, during which time PAH levels declined slowly to background values. Because elevated PAH levels were transient, any elevation in cancer risk from PAH exposure should be very small among nonoccupationally exposed residents of NYC.

Besides the homogeneous reaction of NO with OH, four ad-ditional HONO sources are {{considered in the}} WRF-CHEM model: secondary HONO formation from NO 2 heteroge-neous reaction with semivolatile organics, NO 2 reaction with freshly <b>emitted</b> <b>soot,</b> NO 2 heterogeneous reaction on aerosol and ground surfaces. The WRF-CHEM model with the five HONO sources performs reasonably well in tracking the observed diurnal variation of HONO concentrations. The HONO sources included are found to significantly improve the HOx (OH+HO 2) simulations during daytime and the partition of NO/NO 2 in the morning. The HONO sources also accelerate the accumulation of O 3 concentrations in th...|$|R
50|$|While Thor {{makes his}} way through Vanaheim, back in Asgard, Mangog wreaks havok {{throughout}} the city. Loki tries to stop Mangog, using the freezing casket from Niflheim. His plan backfires, as Mangog easily breaks free from the ice due to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> that it <b>emits.</b> Mangog summons an army of Jötun and Infernir, forcing Loki to change his plans and ask Ulik to allow Thor to use the Frostgrinder but Ulik (having waited to leave Vanaheim for decades) betrays Loki. Thor, meanwhile, reaches {{the doors of the}} Frostgrinder. There, he discovers, through a historical record of Vanaheim, that it was Odin who originally created Mangog after the Vanir had declared war against Asgard. The Vanir were unable to control and defeat Mangog, but they found out that Mangog's only weakness is a god-created mineral called Scabrite (which was used by Odin to forge the chains used to restrain Mangog)Thor eventually confronts and defeats Ulik. As Loki tells Thor about the state of Asgard, Thor reveals Mangog's only possible weakness to Loki. Loki informs Thor that Scabrite can only be found in one realm: Muspelheim, home of the Infernir.|$|R
