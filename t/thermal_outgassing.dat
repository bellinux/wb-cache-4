The major outgassed volatiles from ordinary chondritic material are CH 4, H 2, H 2 O, N 2, and NH 3 (the latter at conditions where hydrous minerals form).

To determine the pressure profile along the cavity {{as a function of}} time, the time-dependent behaviour of the gas has to be simulated. To do that, it is useful to apply accurate three-dimensional method, such as Test Particles Monte Carlo. In this paper, a time-dependent Test Particles Monte Carlo is used.

For example, the development of self-healing (SH) materials for space applications could dramatically improve spacecraft performances and liability, with significant enhancement of mission duration. A number of copolymeric ionomers have been recognized to present self-healing capability under defined ballistic conditions and have risen considerable interest by researchers. On the other hand, when exposed to a vacuum environment for long period, polymers may exhibit considerable mass reduction due to volatile diffusion and loss; this can significantly affect physical and mechanical properties, thus preventing their employment in space applications.

40|$|The {{ability of}} some {{materials}} to self-repair is a characteristic {{particularly important for}} applications in remote or hostile environments where an external intervention is nearly impossible. A typical example of such conditions is given by space environment, where the availability of self-healing (SH) materials could dramatically improve spacecraft performances and liability, with significant improvement of mission duration. Up to now, different materials have been developed, which present self-healing capability under defined conditions. In particular, polymers based on copolymericionomers show intrinsic SH capacityafter a ballistic damage, being able to autonomously repair themselves immediately after the event and can thus be considered as promising candidates in space applications. A preliminary evaluation of possible employment of polyethylene-co-methacrylic acid (EMAA) based ionomers in space environment was carried out. The material response in terms of SH efficiency was studied through hypervelocity impact tests, in order to simulate the collision with micrometeoroids and debris, which is a probable event in space environment. Different experimental configurations were considered by varying target thickness and projectile speed.

40|$|In {{this work}} we measure the optical, magnetic, and {{electrical}} properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and carbon nanotube materials. The bare polarized optical {{absorption cross sections}} of SWNTs are obtained for the first time, and a large anisotropy is found for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the nanotube axes. This result validates predicted depolarization effects and also allows rapid measurement of the alignment of nanotube dispersions. Utilizing these calibrated cross sections, the mechanics of SWNTs in a magnetic field are investigated, and alignment of these molecules shows contributions from both the SWNT intrinsic diamagnetic response and external permanent moments. These magnetic alignment measurements are extended using resonant polarized photoluminescence, and we obtain the pure diamagnetic anisotropies for individual (n, m) SWNT species. Magnetic alignment spectroscopy {{is also used to}} detect the presence of SWNT bundles, and in all semiconducting SWNT bundles we discover new photoluminescence features providing direct evidence of energy transfer between SWNTs in a bundle. Micro-photoluminescence studies on individual tubes show SWNT emission properties depend strongly upon the SWNT environment. We find energy shifts in the photoluminescence emission can be controlled by varying the excitation power absorbed into the SWNT, and suggest these shifts originate from <b>thermal</b> <b>outgassing</b> of adsorbates on the SWNT sidewalls. Thermal properties of percolated nanotube networks embedded in SWNT-epoxy composites are obtained using a custom thermal conductivity measurement and show enhancements in excess of 50 % over pure epoxy.

Transport and optical measurements on nanotube ensembles show unexplained effects at sub-Tesla magnetic fields with near identical field profiles.

To measure the recoil energy in dual-phase noble gas time projection chambers the combination of scintillation and ionisation detection is used to discriminate nuclear from electron recoils. Current experiments use an array of photomultiplier tubes to detect the primary scintillation and the ionisation electrons via secondary scintillation in the gas phase.

40|$|Models {{of thermal}} evolution, crustal production, and CO_ 2 cycling {{are used to}} {{constrain}} the prospects for habitability of rocky planets, with Earth-like size and composition, in the stagnant lid regime. Specifically, we determine {{the conditions under which}} such planets can maintain rates of CO_ 2 degassing large enough to prevent global surface glaciation, but small enough so as not to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO_ 2 accumulation and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with initial radiogenic heating rates of 100 - 250 TW, and with total CO_ 2 budgets ranging from ∼ 10 ^- 2 - 1 times Earth's estimated CO_ 2 budget, can maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for ≈ 1 - 5 Gyrs; larger CO_ 2 budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO_ 2 outgassing longer. Thus, the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet <b>thermal</b> evolution and <b>outgassing</b> are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some first order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of initial radiogenic heat budget.

Process trials, tests and analyses were conducted in order to gain insight into factors that can affect final properties of the cured cyanate ester resin and its composites. The study shows that the cyanate ester resin has a broad process envelope but that an inert-atmosphere cure is essential for obtaining optimum resin and composite properties. Minimizing moisture exposure prior to cure is also crucial as it affects the T{sub g} of the resin and composite. Recommendations for reducing moisture contact with the resin during wet-winding are presented. High fiber volume fraction ({approximately} 80 %) composites wound and cured with these methods yielded excellent hoop tensile strengths (660 to 670 ksi average with individual rings failing above 700 ksi), which are believed to be the highest recorded strengths for this class of materials.

The following processes are discussed: (1) desorption or vaporisation (and cracking respectively) of air, water, residues of milling liquids and lubricants; (2) melting of lubricants and WC-Co eutectics; (3) decomposition of residual hydrocarbons related to milling liquids and lubricants; (4) reduction of oxidic impurities and (5) mass transport phenomena and densification during sintering. These reactions result in length changes, mass changes, thermal effects and gas formation. They are characterised by means of thermoanalytical methods (Thermodilatometry, Differentia! Thermal Analysis, and Mass Spectrometry). Examples for the kinetic analysis of the results are presented. Kinetic {{analysis is}} a tool to model complex thermal behaviour with few parameters. The model can then be used for predictions and for process optimization. Simultaneous complex <b>thermal</b> analysis of <b>outgassing,</b> melting of the binder phase and sintering gives accurate insights into the relationship between these processes. This knowledge is important because with increasing temperatures of outgassing the sensitivity of product quality to process parameters also increases. If the outgassing takes place at unfavourable temperatures (where the shrinkage rates are too high if active surfaces are created or gasses are entrapped) pores or disturbances of the carbon balance may occur. This knowledge may also be used for the optimisation of technical processes. The thermoanalytical data are a key to understanding critical temperature ranges for product quality (initiation of reactions and ranges with high reaction rates). Thermoanalytical methods are particularly powerful for the determination of the influence of changes in material or process parameters...|$|R

Although Lake Superior is Earth’s largest lake by surface area, {{few studies have}} outlined its inorganic carbon cycle, including whether the lake is net heterotrophic (a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere) or autotrophic (a sink of atmospheric CO 2). Comparing the lake surface water pCO 2 values to atmospheric pCO 2 allows for {{the determination of the}} balance between primary production and respiration within the lake. This study expands upon previous studies by applying improved spectrophotometric pH measurement methods along with total inorganic carbon and alkalinity measurements to calculate lake surface pCO 2 and overall air-water differences in pCO 2 (ΔpCO 2) at a greater number of sampling locations and collection times in the western arm of Lake Superior. The pH measurements in this study also provide a well-characterized timepoint for determining long term trends in lake acidity as a function of climate change. Western Lake Superior (“the western arm”) was determined to be net heterotrophic in spring and approximately neutral in summer, before again turning net heterotrophic in the fall. Surface water pCO 2 values were found to be higher on average and more variable overall in the 2014 sampling season (relative to 2015) perhaps because of the harsher preceding winter. On a seasonal basis, measured pH values followed an antiphase relationship to pCO 2 with the lowest values occurring in the spring and increasing throughout the summer with a higher overall average occurring after the milder 2014 - 15 winter. Our data indicates that Lake Superior may provide a negative feedback loop buffering changes in local climate. This is due, in part, to the strong iii dominance of heterotrophy that is observed after cold winters which delay the start of <b>thermal</b> stratification, ultimately <b>outgassing</b> more CO 2...|$|R
40|$|There was {{a thermal}} anomaly of the Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) {{radiative}} cooler cold stage during the cooler outgas phase in flight. With the cooler {{door in the}} outgas position and the outgas heaters enabled, the cold stage temperature increased {{to a maximum of}} 323 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, which was warmer than the 316. 3 K upper set point of the outgas heater controller on the cold stage. Also, the outgas heater cycled off when the cold stage was warming up to 323 K. A corrective action was taken before the attitude of the spacecraft was changed during the first week in flight. One orbit before the attitude was changed, the outgas heaters were disabled to cool off the cold stage. The cold stage temperature increase was strongly dependent on the spacecraft roll and yaw. It provided evidence that direct solar radiation entered the gap between the cooler door and cooler shroud. There was a concern that the direct solar radiation could cause polymerization of hydrocarbons, which could contaminate the cooler and lead to a <b>thermal</b> short. After <b>outgas</b> with the cooler door in the outgas position for seven days, the cooler door was changed to the fully open position. With the cooler door fully open, the maximum cold stage temperature was 316. 3 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, and the duty cycle of the outgas heater in the eclipse was the same as that in the sunlight. It provided more evidence that direct solar radiation had entered the gap between the cooler door and cooler shroud. Cooler outgas continued for seven more days, with the cooler door fully open. The corrective actions had prevented overheating of the cold stage and cold focal plane array (CFPA), which could damage these two components. They also minimized the risk of contamination on the cold stage, which could lead to a thermal short...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{structures}} are conventionally constructed of aerospace-grade metallic and composite [1] materials {{which can be}} costly to manufacture and operate. Recent advances in rapid manufacture capabilities now allow this application to satellite structures. Satellite structures constructed using rapid manufacture techniques may be more cost effective, be able to incorporate previously impossible structural complexity and allow optimised structures to be developed that reduce mass, reduce component count and increase functionality. [2] There has been a steady progression of increased resolution, increased speed of production, reduction of unit costs and a widening of material choices in rapid manufacturing. By utilizing 3 -D printing techniques, load optimised structures with fewer joints and parts can be manufactured which allow the production of low mass geometries currently not feasible. This research aims to develop, deploy and demonstrate the technology of a satellite structure for a Cube-Satellite utilising rapid manufacturing processes. The CubeSat will be launched {{as part of the}} QB 50 project which will deploy a network 50 CubeSats into a 'string-of-pearls' configuration to perform atmospheric sounding in the thermosphere. [3] The primary impact of this work is as a proof of concept and technology demonstration. Currently, rapid manufactured satellite structures have a technology readiness level (TRL) of 2 - 6 depending on the material. The technology has been demonstrated in a laboratory environment, and validated in operational environments. This project aims to carry the development through prototyping in an operational environment (TRL 6 - 7), qualification testing (TRL 8) to deployment as a system through mission operations (TRL 9). The material has undergone materials selection testing according to ECSS-Q-ST- 70 - 02 (R 07), of which Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone (PEEK) was selected. The selection process incorporated thermal vacuum cycling which monitored the Total Mass Loss (TML) and Collected Volatile Condensable Material (CVCM). In addition, structural assessments before and after thermal vacuum conditioning were performed, where the tensile strength, Young's modulus, hardness and coefficient of thermal expansion were determined. An initial structural design utilising the selected material has been developed after satisfying preliminary calculations and numerical vibrational analyses via ABAQUS. Material coupon testing, <b>thermal</b> bake-out and <b>outgassing</b> tests have also been performed. After ground testing, a flight ready version of the structure will be manufactured and incorporated into UNSW's QB 50 CubeSat. Throughout the life in orbit, material temperature will be monitored along with tensile and Young's modulus. Data will be telemetered to ground and flight data will be used to assess the material and the suitability of the manufacturing process to produce satellite structures and determine the final TRL. 1.
