Nifedipine was 1000 -fold more active than <b>trimetazidine</b> in depressing cardiac functional parameters. In the Langendorff heart, nifedipine, but not <b>trimetazidine,</b> increased the coronary flow. With the exception of <b>trimetazidine</b> (4 x 10 (- 5) mol/l) in the Langendorff heart, nifedipine and <b>trimetazidine</b> markedly improved and in a similar fashion, the recovery of cardiac mechanical parameters in the three models of myocardial ischaemia. Pretreatment with nifedipine, but not with <b>trimetazidine,</b> resulted in slightly but statistically not significant higher ATP-levels after global ischaemia in the working heart and in the heart-lung preparation. After reperfusion, the cardioprotective effect of nifedipine was associated with increased ATP-levels, whereas that of <b>trimetazidine</b> was merely related to increased phosphocreatine (PCr) levels.

Using Fura- 2 fluorescence photometry and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings we investigated the effect of <b>trimetazidine</b> on the [Ca(2 +) ](i) and current responses induced by the application of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists on low density vestibular ganglion neuronal cultures explanted from 3 day s postnatal rats. <b>Trimetazidine</b> blocked the [Ca(2 +) ](i) and current responses induced by 100 microM applications of both kainate and alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate (AMPA). These responses were dependent on external Ca(2 +) and were blocked by the voltage-dependent Ca(2 +) channel blockers Ni(2 +) and Cd(2 +). <b>Trimetazidine</b> only acts on the AMPA/kainate receptors and had no effect on K(+) -induced depolarizations.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of the antiischemic effect of the antianginal agent <b>trimetazidine</b> remains uncertain.

In view of clinical data suggesting that perhexiline improves symptomatic status in unstable angina pectoris, and the known role of mitochondrial beta-oxidation in platelet metabolism, we compared the platelet carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 inhibitory and putative anti-aggregatory effects of perhexiline, amiodarone and <b>trimetazidine</b> with those of specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 inhibitors: etomoxir and hydroxyphenylglyoxylate in both normal subjects and patients with stable angina. All of the compounds examined inhibited platelet carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 activity; rank order of potency etomoxir > malonyl-CoA > hydroxyphenylglyoxylate > amiodarone > or = perhexiline > <b>trimetazidine.</b> However, only perhexiline, amiodarone and <b>trimetazidine</b> inhibited platelet aggregation.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{efficiency}} of pre-administration of <b>trimetazidine</b> in experimental cardiac contusion in order to lower the degree of posttraumatic myocardial dysfunction. Materials and methods: experiments were carried out on non-inbred albino male rats anesthetized with sodium thiopental. Cardiac contusion was reproduced by an original device that imitated a blow of the steering wheel to the anterior chest, as that observed when a moving car clashes against an obstacle. Some animals were traumatized after preadministration of <b>trimetazidine</b> (25 mg/kg intraperi-toneally). An electrocardiogram, left carotid blood pressure, an integral rheogram, and the first derivative of a differential rheogram were recorded in the direct fashion prior to cardiac contusion simulation and in different posttraumatic periods. Stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral vascular resistance were calculated. Results. Preinjection of <b>trimetazidine</b> significantly prevented the development of arrhythmias in the early posttraumatic period and improved systemic hemodynamic parameters: stroke volume, cardiac output, blood pressure, and total peripheral vascular resistance. No death case within the first hour of a posttraumatic period was an integral criterion for the efficiency of preventive use of <b>trimetazidine</b> in cardiac contusion.
