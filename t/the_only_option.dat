5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} ship that would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E
5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was {{to record the}} music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
50|$|For the {{ordinary}} citizen though, especially in rural areas, often <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> are to cycle, walk or go by dugout canoe.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of object {{extraction}} (the trace is a complement of VP), theta-government is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> possible <b>option.</b> In <b>the</b> case of subject extraction (the trace in Spec-IP), antecedent-government is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> possible <b>option.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Australia, a 1.8-litre four-cylinder E250 CGI {{model is}} available, {{as well as}} a 2.1-litre four-cylinder diesel model known as the E250 CDI. AIRSCARF and AIRCAP are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> on <b>the</b> E250 models.|$|R
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E
5|$|In the subplot, Bart cuts {{school on}} the day {{students}} were choosing their physical education classes. By the time he shows up, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> left is ballet. Despite being reluctant at first, he soon discovers {{that he has a}} talent for the dance form, and is invited to star in a school ballet performance. After his performance, school bullies attempt to beat him up, and he runs away. Bart attempts to escape by jumping a trench, but fails to make it and takes a nasty fall. The bullies leave, while Lisa tells Bart how proud she is of him, that they are now kindred spirits.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the battle}} at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and a Native American confederacy had collapsed. No parties aided him and his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon {{realized}} that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to return across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce. They were told to wave a white flag at the militia.|$|E
5000|$|Since the [...] and [...] {{characters}} typically {{also serve}} other purposes at the command line, {{they may not}} be available in all scenarios, therefore, they should not be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> to access <b>the</b> corresponding help information.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were power moonroof, power antenna, {{illuminated}} entry, keyless entry, automatic climate control, {{engine block}} heater, and a Traction-Lok axle with a 3.08 gear ratio. Total Production of 20th anniversary Cougar was 5,002, {{with at least}} 800 destined for Canada.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} {{at least}} 15 years, Dahl had to decide {{where he was going}} to study art, though <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> in Sweden at the time were an {{apprenticeship}} in the Painters' Guild or joining the Martin Hannibal and David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl group.|$|R
5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, but <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
50|$|Until {{elementary}} schools were {{established by the}} Elementary Education Act 1870, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> available to parents were for children to pay for tuition at private schools, or to be accepted for free charitable schools such as Ragged schools, which did not charge for attendance.|$|R
50|$|At its 1990 redesign, the Lincoln Town Car {{was offered}} with {{relatively}} few options, with nearly all features as standard equipment. On the Signature Series, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were leather seat trim, a moonroof, a 10-disc CD changer, JBL sound system, security system, and onboard telephone.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{development}} environments did {{not automatically}} add a version resource in their compiled libraries, so many developers overlooked this aspect. Checking file dates, overwriting existing files or skipping the copy operation if the DLL was already installed were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> available {{in lieu of}} correct versioning.|$|R
5|$|In {{the prime}} universe, Nina Sharp helps {{to set up}} Massive Dynamic's {{resources}} to track these occurrences, preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed. Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss, a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to. However, Sam has disappeared and cannot be found. Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes that he himself is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option.</b> Walter comes {{to recognize that the}} Observer's efforts from earlier ("The Firefly") were to prepare him to lose Peter. After preparing himself, Peter goes to touch the machine, but is sent flying by an electrical spark, wounding him and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital chapel, Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions, while Olivia arrives after hearing the news. She steps outside to observe the sunset when Sam Weiss runs up to her and demands to be taken to the machine to stop what is already happening.|$|E
5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna {{are still}} on the run, rescued by Martin who calls the AA. Whilst on their journey, they accidentally kill three more people, a mechanic, a shop {{assistant}} and a policeman. Soon, they decide that, with no transport, money or employment, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> is suicide. They are last seen, naked, walking hand-in-hand towards the sea. Meanwhile, Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident and has developed better dress sense. Boyce ends up missing Alan, after his replacement turns out to be even more horrible. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot, as in The Lord of the Flies. They form their own tribe and become hostile to anyone who enters the department.|$|E

25|$|Tupper {{was present}} at the {{founding}} meeting of the Imperial Federation League in July 1884, where he argued against a resolution which said that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> open to <b>the</b> British Empire were Imperial Federation or disintegration. Tupper believed that a form of limited federation was possible and desirable.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the disks}} posed {{a problem if}} they were damaged or lost, as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> at <b>the</b> time to obtain {{replacements}} was via postal mail or IBM's dialup BBS service. Without the disks, any new hardware would be completely useless and the computer would not boot at all until the unconfigured device was removed.|$|R
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant.

5|$|On 4 September, Mary Kom had {{its world}} premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it became the}} first Hindi film to be {{screened}} on the opening night of the film festival. It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International {{as part of a}} four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state {{would not be able to}} see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> for native people to watch the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E

50|$|After Elizabeth {{had endured}} a {{prolonged}} labor, Dr. Humphrey and Bennett determined <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were a Caesarean section on Elizabeth or a craniotomy on the unborn infant. Dr. Humphrey {{refused to do}} anything, feeling that either operation meant certain death for both the mother and her infant. It appears Dr. Humphrey then left the Bennett home.|$|R
50|$|Nitpicking is {{the act of}} {{removing}} nits (the eggs of lice, generally head lice) from the host's hair. As the nits are cemented to individual hairs, they cannot be removed with most lice combs and, before modern chemical methods were invented, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were to shave all the host's hair or to pick them free one by one.|$|R
5|$|After {{the battle}} was finished, Scheer wrote an {{assessment}} of the engagement for the Kaiser; in it, he strongly urged for the resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign in the Atlantic. He argued that it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> to defeat Great Britain. Scheer spent the majority of the remainder of the year debating the issue with the naval command. Ultimately, Scheer and his allies prevailed and the unrestricted submarine campaign was resumed in February 1917. Despite his conviction that only the U-boats could defeat Britain, Scheer continued to utilize the surface fleet. On 18–19 August 1916, the High Seas Fleet again sortied in an attempt to draw out and defeat Admiral Beatty's battlecruiser squadron. The Royal Navy again intercepted German communications and sent the Grand Fleet out. In this case, however, Scheer's reconnaissance worked as intended, and warned him of the Grand Fleet's approach in time to retreat back to Germany. In later 1917, Scheer began to use light elements of the fleet to raid British convoys to Norway in the North Sea. This forced the British to deploy battleships to escort the convoys, which presented Scheer with the opportunity to attempt to isolate and destroy several battleships of the Grand Fleet. On 23 April 1918, Scheer sent the entire High Seas Fleet to intercept one of the convoys. However, Hipper's battlecruisers crossed the convoy's path several times without sighting any ships; it was later discovered that German intelligence had miscalculated the date the convoy would depart Britain. The German fleet turned south and reached their North Sea bases by 19:00.|$|E
5|$|Cornered, Montfort had {{to accept}} a truce and agree to submit the issue to {{arbitration}} by the French king Louis IX. By the Mise of Amiens, Louis decided entirely in favour of Henry, and repudiated the provisions. The settlement did not present {{a solution to the}} conflict, but rather a recipe for further problems. The one-sided decision for the king and against the barons left Montfort with little choice but armed rebellion. Hostilities started already in February, when Montfort's sons, Henry and another Simon, attacked the possessions of Roger Mortimer in the Marches. Henry summoned the feudal army, and the royal forces won an important victory at Northampton, where the younger Simon was captured. Montfort was still in control of London, as Henry regained control over Kent and Sussex. Montfort marched out of London to negotiate, but the termsinvolving maintaining the provisionswere rejected by the king. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> remaining was to fight, and the two forces met at Lewes on 14 May 1264. In spite of inferior numbers, the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort won the battle. Edward, commanding the right wing, quickly defeated the London forces. When he set out in pursuit of the fleeing soldiers, however, he left the rest of the royal army exposed. The baronial forces took advantage of the situation, and soon won the day.|$|E
5|$|The Lucera, {{trying the}} same evasive tactic, {{was the next}} galley attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the {{mainmast}} and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own bowsprit, but in return completely demolished {{the stern of the}} galley. Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, tearing the galley apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galleots were chasing two galleys; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in a sinking state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort. Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The galley San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.|$|E
