5|$|Her myths emphasise her bad {{temper and}} unhappiness, due to {{rejection}} {{by her father}} Shiva and her husband, and the hatred of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, identified with Parvati in this context).

Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E

5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with the stigma that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to their owners.

In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, {{along with many other}} zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Lilly was an {{advocate}} of federal regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, {{and many of his}} suggested reforms were enacted into law in 1906, resulting {{in the creation of the}} Food and Drug Administration. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of prescriptions, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), established the Lilly Endowment in 1937; it remains as one of the largest charitable benefactors in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways.

Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
