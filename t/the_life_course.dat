The sequences and the timing of transitions into various <b>life</b> <b>course</b> stages, and <b>the</b> durations of stay in those stages are analyzed through multiple-decrement life tables. Changes in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> over 10 -year birth cohorts from 1910 to 1970 and differentials by gender are highlighted in the paper. The analysis reveals that what is traditionally {{thought of as a}} "typical" <b>life</b> <b>course</b> is experienced only by one-fourth to one-third of a cohort. With the increasing diversity of <b>life</b> <b>course</b> stages among younger cohorts, it would no longer be adequate to consider only <b>the</b> "typical" <b>life</b> stages in future analyses...|$|R

The thesis reflects the fact, that the numbers of pupils with the diagnosis are constantly increasing in primary schools. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine <b>the</b> educational <b>life</b> <b>course</b> of <b>the</b> child with autism spectrum disorder which is fulfilling compulsory school attendance in the regular class of primary school and to identify risk factors and differences in the education of these children. To realize this objective method of qualitative research has been chosen - specifically, the collective case study, based on an analysis of documentation. Based on comparison of individual educational <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> of probands and <b>the</b> ideal educational <b>life</b> <b>course</b> that was outlined in the relevant chapter of this study, risk factors and differences in <b>the</b> educational <b>life</b> <b>course</b> of <b>the</b> children with autism spectrum disorder were identified.

40|$|Many {{questions}} in <b>life</b> <b>course</b> epidemiology involve mediation and/or interaction {{because of the}} long latency period between exposures and outcomes.

Using theory and simulated data, we show how <b>the</b> alternative <b>life</b> <b>course</b> hypotheses assessed in <b>the</b> structured <b>life</b> <b>course</b> approach correspond to different combinations of mediation and interaction parameters. For example, an early life critical period model corresponds to a direct effect of <b>the</b> early <b>life</b> exposure, but no indirect effect via the mediator and no interaction between <b>the</b> early <b>life</b> exposure and <b>the</b> mediator.

25|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} upon this group because {{the years between}} the late teens and the mid-twenties are {{believed}} to be a critical period during which young people form adult identities and move toward independence. The effects of youth disconnection—limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connections—can have long-term consequences that snowball across <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>course,</b> eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to physical and mental health and marital prospects. Much discussion has been focused on how to reach these young people and connect them with broader social institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.|$|E
25|$|Common market health {{measures}} such as GDP and GNP {{have been used as}} a measure of successful policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth. This has been {{explained by the fact that}} the dependency is not linear but logarithmic, i.e., the same percentual increase in the GNP produces the same increase in happiness for wealthy countries as for poor countries. Increasingly, academic economists and international economic organisations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Aché {{cultural}} conventions emphasize food sharing, regulated cooperation, group {{participation in}} raising and nourishing children, restrained violence, and marriage proscriptions {{for members of}} the ethnic group. [...] Behaviors towards outgroup individuals is unregulated. The birth of a child introduces a series of lifelong obligations between the child, its parents, and those who take on ritual roles during the birth. The child's mother is helped during labor and later is ritually washed by some of the helpers. The child will be held immediately after birth by a [...] "godmother" [...] that is responsible for washing and caring for the infant during the first few days after birth while mother rests. [...] The child and godmother adopt ritual terms for each other, and the child can expect food, help and support from its godmother throughout its life. A man cuts the umbilical cord of the child and becomes the [...] "godfather" [...] with similar lifelong obligations. Men who have provided the mother with game during her pregnancy also take on a ritual obligation to the child, and so do all the band members who hold the child and wash it soon after birth. The obligations through <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>course</b> are reciprocal such that the child is cared for by ritual [...] "godparents" [...] when young and later cares for them in turn when they become elderly. Both biological parents and all the ritual godparents retain lifetime obligations of mutual aid.|$|E
2500|$|An adolescent's {{environment}} plays a huge role {{in their}} identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, {{studies show that the}} more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case {{during the middle of the}} 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>course.</b> This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. [...] So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. [...] Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. [...] While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.|$|E

On the one hand, we have learnt that societal change in terms of economic modernisation was rather constant in the post-war period in West Germany (Becker and Mayer 2019; Becker and Blossfeld 2017; Blossfeld 1986). On the other hand, from the perspective of life-course research, we are interested in structural regularities, including the main social mechanisms behind them, but not in historical singularities (Blossfeld 1996). The event history data meets our requirements and it is possible to make evidence-based prognoses for the period after 2008 (Blossfeld et al. 2007).
