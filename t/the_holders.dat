They did not progress past the group stages, and Ferguson has since admitted his regrets in how they handled the situation.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal, the {{defending}} champions, entered the match as favourites, but went behind early when Brian Stein scored. Luton's disciplined approach, {{coupled with a}} strong performance by Dibble, contained Arsenal to few chances throughout the game. <b>The</b> <b>holders</b> equalised and {{took the lead in}} quick succession through Martin Hayes and Alan Smith, but failed to seal the win when Nigel Winterburn missed a penalty. A revitalised Luton staged a late comeback; Caesar's failed clearance led to Danny Wilson equalising, and in the 90th minute, Brian Stein scored the winner after poor defending from Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea were {{appearing}} in the Community Shield for the sixth time and were <b>the</b> <b>holders,</b> after beating Arsenal 2–1 in the 2005 edition. Including this victory they had won the competition three times, in 1955 and 2000. In contrast, Liverpool were {{appearing in}} their 21st match in the competition. They had won eight outright (1966, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1988, 1989, 2001), shared five (1964, 1965, 1974, 1977, 1986, 1990) and lost six (1922, 1971, 1983, 1984, 1992, 2002).

It was held at Wembley Stadium, on 10 August 1991. The game was played between Arsenal, champions of the 1990–91 Football League and Tottenham Hotspur, who beat Nottingham Forest to win the 1991 FA Cup Final.

40|$|Abstract: Structural damage {{detection}} by <b>the</b> <b>Holder</b> exponent receives much attention recently. Many investigations {{have been successfully}} applied to the crack identification, especially for the beam-type structures. However, a comprehensive analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Holder</b> exponent has been absent. Result in some conclusions had been drawn are unilateral. In this paper, the mode shapes of the clamped-clamped beams are analytical studied and a program calculating <b>the</b> <b>Holder</b> exponents of <b>the</b> mode shape signals with different damages is compiled with MATLAB. By comprehensively studying <b>the</b> <b>Holder</b> exponents of <b>the</b> clamped-clamped beams with cracks of different sizes, locations, and different order modes, a new phenomenon that the values of <b>the</b> <b>Holder</b> exponent vary with different locations of the crack is detected. The results also show that <b>the</b> <b>Holder</b> exponent decreases {{with the increase of}} the mode number. However, there are not obvious relations between <b>the</b> <b>Holder</b> exponent and <b>the</b> order of the mode for the whole beam locations...|$|R

5|$|After a mildly {{successful}} {{period in}} the 1960s, where they stood among the top contenders, Southern European teams started to lose influence in the European stage during the 1970s, as Dutch and German teams appeared stronger. In the 1971–72 European Cup, Benfica lost in the semi-finals to a Johan Cruyff-led Ajax {{on their way to}} a second consecutive win. Benfica reached the quarter-finals of the 1974–75 European Cup Winners' Cup, before being eliminated by another Dutch team, PSV Eindhoven. Over the course of the late 1970s, as historic players like Eusébio and Simões retired, Benfica could not maintain the same performance of the previous decade, and only secured two European Cup quarter-final presences. In 1975–76, they lost 5–1 to <b>the</b> <b>holders</b> Bayern Munich, and in 1977–78, they were knocked out by the defending champions Liverpool with a 6–2 aggregate score.|$|E
5|$|After the curacy {{was placed}} under the {{patronage}} of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed, {{partly due to the}} vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration <b>the</b> <b>holders</b> of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time. From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, when the house was sold.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the 2002 FA Community Shield as <b>the</b> <b>holders</b> of the FA Cup, beating Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final. The team later won the 2001–02 FA Premier League and completed the domestic double. The other Community Shield place went to league runners-up Liverpool, who secured second place {{on the final day}} of the season. The game marked Arsenal's 16th Charity Shield appearance and first since 1999, where they beat Manchester United by two goals to one. By contrast this was Liverpool's 20th, who incidentally played United and won by exactly the same scoreline to become holders of the trophy. The last meeting between the two teams was in the FA Cup; a goal by Dennis Bergkamp ensured Arsenal progressed into the fifth round of the competition.|$|E

After overcoming replays {{in the first two}} rounds and a difficult tie against Preston North End, Chelsea recorded an impressive win against Tottenham Hotspur.

The 2003 final was the first to be played indoors; the roof was closed because of bad weather.

Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga saw England again reach the knockout stages as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12–10 defeat of Australia in Marseille and a narrow 14–9 victory over the host nation France carried England to a second successive final appearance. The final was played in Paris on 20 October against South Africa, who won by 15 points to 6.|$|E
5|$|The Claimant was now bankrupt.

About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E
