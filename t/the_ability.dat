5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to use a unique carbon source, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to take upon a particular ecological niche, or <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, {{making it possible to}} determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Connectivity to the Game Boy Advance was {{discussed}} {{as an opportunity}} among the developers, but they eventually agreed that Double Dash!! was not suited to these connectivity ideas and decided to exclude it.

Therefore, gameplay features like <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both veteran and novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E

5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to resist}} the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward.

5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to take part in}} normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E
