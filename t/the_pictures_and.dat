One day, he is sent pictures over the internet, depicting a murder in an alley; he later witnesses a murder resembling the one in <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> <b>and</b> believes the killer to be a pink-haired girl he sees at the crime scene. Because of his presence {{at the scene of the}} crime, he is suspected of being the murderer, and starts suffering from paranoia and experiencing delusions. More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who have an interest in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. One of them is the pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims to be friends with him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E

Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>and</b> began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E

Security forces had the images taken to study the claims of Ghazi Abdul Rashid regarding casualties and damage caused to Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa. The UAVs flew over Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa {{for more than an}} hour, from 2:40 to 4:00am. Senior government officials and the Security Forces personnel examined <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>and</b> relayed the information directly to the command post on the ground. The UAV was given to Pakistan by the United States for use in the War on Terror. Strategic planning for the assault on the mosque was conducted based on information gathered by the drone. Pakistan deployed several security units to execute the attack on the mosque. These include the Army's 78th Paratrooper Brigade and 111th Infantry Brigade; its elite strike force, the Special Service Group (SSG) Division; the Ninth Wing Company of the Pakistan Army, the Rangers paramilitary force; and the Elite Police squad of the Punjab Police.|$|E

25|$|On 20 March 2017 the Mirror {{painted the}} {{traditional}} Russian pancake celebration Maslenitsa as a Hooligan training ground. One of the centuries-old tradition in this Russian festival is “wall-to-wall” (‘’, Ru) which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes. This tradition was wrongly {{represented by the}} Mirror in <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>and</b> text, labeled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this Russian traditional festival at all. The Mirror article was titled “Russia's Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at World Cup.”, and received negative receptions from Russian media and was also labeled as Fake news. The organizers of the traditional Russian folk festival event are looking to sue the Daily Mirror, it is reported later. Representatives of Daily Mirror acknowledged that the original material of the publication about Russian Hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the traditional festival. In the updated version of the article the newspaper continues {{to insist that the}} photographed people were hooligans in the pictures, but gives no evidence of their participation in the festival.|$|E

25|$|In a {{portrait}} of Papak and his son Shapur carved on Takht-e Jamshid, Papak, while dressed as a priest, squeezes the hilt of his sword by one hand and manipulates the fire of the hearth and adds more firewood to it by the other hand, with his son Shapur taking the royal ring from him. In other pictures of granting the royal medal during the time, meaning granting Khwasak, the mayor of Susa, which is discovered there, and the picture of granting the medal to the governor of Elymais, discovered in Bardneshandeh, the Parthian emperor is granting the royal medal to local shahs; while in the mentioned picture of Papak and his son Shapur in Takht-e Jamshid, it is Papak who is granting the royal ring to Shapur wearing like priests. Lokonin believed that the carving of Papak granting the royal medal to his sone shows that the Sasanians took the power by force in Pars and wished to show their independence from the Parthian emperors; that was why Papak personally grants the royal medal to his son in the mentioned picture. Lokonin also believes that the religious clothes and medals of Papak on <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>and</b> cois of Shapur (his son), show the separation of religious and royal rule -at the time; Papak was the grand priest and his son Shapur was the land's shah. Daryaee believes that the picture shows multiple things; first that the House of Sasan had both the religious and irreligious powers together in Pars; second that the fire creed, related to Zoroastrianism, lived on before the rise of Ardashir; third that the carved picture of Shapur and Papak in Takht-e Jamshid shows {{the importance of the}} Achaemenid structure for the Sasanians.|$|E

Colls and Wass had ambitious plans to recoup their money by selling engravings of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>and</b> {{by taking the}} paintings {{on a tour of}} Britain and Europe. The paintings proved less popular than expected. Very few engravings were sold and the tours did not take place; Wass declared bankruptcy in 1852. The paintings were separated, and sold on to a series of buyers, with the third panel fetching just 7guineas in 1893 as Etty's popularity continued to wane. By the 1950s all three panels of Joan of Arc were believed lost or destroyed, although some preliminary studies survive.|$|E
500|$|Anne Carroll Moore, then {{in charge}} of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an {{enthusiastic}} review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book [...] "so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight", and [...] "as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy." [...] Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, [...] "What an amusing picture book... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>and</b> the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!"
