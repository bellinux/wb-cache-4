5|$|Big Wapwallopen Creek {{has been}} {{described}} as a small creek. The <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the creek's watershed mainly consists of broken hills, with a few swamps and lakes. Nescopeck Mountain is on the watershed's southeastern border.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of Aldermaston {{is influenced by}} Paices Hill and Rag Hill, which are extremities of the chalk formation the North Wessex Downs {{as part of the}} Thames Basin Heaths. The <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the land in the parish generally slopes northward to the River Kennet.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> {{the area}} in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville. In 1820, it started {{to be used as a}} school, which was run by Jacob Gensel.|$|E
40|$|Functional {{analysis}} results for multiple <b>topographies</b> <b>of</b> aberrant behavior were graphed in an aggregate fashion and then separately for 48 clients.

5|$|Mining has {{historically}} {{been done in the}} watershed of Nanticoke Creek. This has substantially altered the hydrology and <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the watershed.

5|$|Mountains such as Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain and Penobscot Mountain are {{partially}} in {{the watershed}}. The <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the watershed features refuse piles, crop falls, and strip pits in numerous places due to past mining. Some {{parts of the}} creek are known to run dry at times. Some water from the watershed flows to the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes, outside of the Nanticoke Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|Some {{residents}} of Vilankulo attempted {{to flee the}} area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland before the storm hit. They evacuated {{many of the people}} who remained, taking them to tent camps. Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning. Because of the <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{begins on}} the Pocono Plateau. It is a {{mountain}} stream that flows the Moosic Mountains in Simersons Gap. At points, it also flows through a gorge or through dense brush. Mountains in the watershed include Coon Hill and Scrub Oak Mountain. The <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the watershed is mountainous, with high steep hills {{that have been}} rounded by glaciation. The stream's valley is narrow. It {{is one of the}} larger tributaries of the Lackawanna River. It is a second-order stream.|$|E
5|$|Structure A-19 and Structure C-9 are ballcourts. They have a {{resemblance}} to ballcourts at Chichen Itza. Both ballcourts are aligned east-west, an unusual {{feature in the}} Maya area, although the <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the site severely restricted {{the layout of the}} city to a principally east-west orientation. BallcourtA-19 lies on the west side on the north plaza.|$|E

5|$|The chief {{engineer}} of the Corinth Canal, Béla Gerster, conducted extensive {{research on the}} <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the Isthmus, but did not discover the Diolkos. Remains of the ship trackway were probably first identified by the German archaeologist Habbo Gerhard Lolling in the 1883 Baedeker edition. In 1913, James George Frazer reported in his commentary on Pausanias on traces of an ancient trackway across the Isthmus, while parts of the western quay were discovered by Harold North Fowler in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on developed land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space. Of the remaining land, most of it is considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000. In general, the <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the watershed consists of rolling land that is densely settled. A large undeveloped tract of land owned by the Delaware County Industrial Development Authority is located {{at the mouth of the}} creek.|$|E

5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis {{visually}} augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the flat}} <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> Essex County, the land use {{surrounding}} Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E
5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E

40|$|A fringe-projection {{system for}} {{microscopic}} applications, fringe-projecting microscopy, is developed and analyzed. Projection of the grating and imaging of the fringe system, modulated by the surface, are accomplished {{by the same}} high-aperture objective. The spectrum of the grating is spatially filtered and projected into the aperture with a lateral shift, {{which leads to a}} telecentric projection under oblique incidence and telecentric imaging. <b>Topographies</b> <b>of</b> specularly as well as diffusely reflecting surfaces can be obtained. The measurement of highly rough surfaces is described together with preprocessing steps. The resulting intensity distribution of the fringes is analyzed. Formulas for vertical and lateral resolution, measuring range, and dynamic range, based on noise considerations, are presented and verified by <b>topographies</b> <b>of</b> technical surfaces...|$|R
