5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander {{around looking for}} thinner skin such as is found on the ears of mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting {{a hole in the}} host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, and keep the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy force {{took only}} <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> disable the corvettes. They {{then began to}} pull {{survivors}} out of the sea, but the rescue was suspended at about 22:30, when the TA 20 {{was picked up by}} radar and fired upon. The first salvo hit her bridge killing all officers, and knocking out her fire-control system. She sank close to Pag Island. Neither TA 20, nor the corvettes managed to radio news of the attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> take the photo whilst he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, {{and as soon}} as he was freed brought Booth to court. The case was so popular that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombardment}} {{was scheduled}} to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno, but due to heavy seas, the landing was delayed by <b>ten</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>to</b> 07:45 in Mike sector and 07:55 in Nan Sector. This was at a slightly higher tide, closer to the beach obstacles and mines. The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance. The seas proved too rough to launch the DD tanks, so they were ordered to deploy from the LCTs several hundred yards out from the beach.|$|E

Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington {{represented}} Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts. While both Rigby Smith and Douglas Hogg were highly respected barristers, Booth's cross-examination by Hastings was so skilfully done that the jury took only <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> find that he had been fraudulent; they awarded Gruban £4,750 (about £ in 2015).|$|E
5|$|The four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, {{moved to}} the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw {{identical}} scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, {{the strength of the}} United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|After the war the {{greyhound}} company introduced floodlights and in 1958 {{the entire}} surface required relaying after the Commonwealth Games had finished. In 1971 the Welsh Greyhound Derby was given 'classic' status. In 1977 the Cardiff City Council announced that a revamp of the Arms Park site would not include greyhound racing. The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh Greyhound Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 greyhound fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race. Cardiff City Council had taken less than <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> reject a plan to switch greyhound racing to nearby Maindy Stadium.|$|E

5|$|From 1996 to 2001, the Czech Republic won six {{consecutive}} World Championship medals, including World Championship gold from 1999 to 2001, {{as well as}} gold at the 1998 Winter Olympics. In 2002, the Czechs were favoured to win, but were upset in the quarter final by Russia. In the gold medal game between Russia and Slovakia, Slovakian Peter Bondra scored {{in the final two}} minutes of the game and the nation won its first ever World Championship. At the 2003 World Championships, Sweden made one of the biggest comebacks in tournament history, rallying from a 5–1 deficit in their quarterfinal game against Finland to win 6–5. The gold medal game between Canada and Sweden went into overtime. Canada's Anson Carter scored the winning goal 13 minutes into play, but the goal had to be reviewed for <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> determine if the puck had crossed the line. In a rematch between the two nations the following year, Canada won and repeated as champions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} stage, the riders fell {{after only a}} few kilometres. Lipman broke a finger, and became the first rider to abandon this Tour. Around 100km in the race, Lucien Pothier lost <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> the main group, led by Maurice Garin, because of a broken bicycle. In Cosne, at 174km, Pothier had reached the leading group. Aucouturier had lost more than one hour at that point. Just before the next control post in Nevers, Aucouturier fell on his face, and {{continued}} the race covered in blood. In {{the last part of the}} race, Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier rode away from the others. They were attacked by four masked men in a car, but still finished as the first two, with Garin beating Pothier by 50m. The many flat tires and crashes of Aucouturier, seemingly the results of sabotage, gave him a time loss of several hours.|$|E
5|$|Lay {{pleaded not}} guilty to the eleven {{criminal}} charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is a difficult one. She sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.|$|E

5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> acquit him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Vergne was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 2.350 seconds, ahead of Prost in second and Bird third. Rosenqvist was fourth-fastest; Félix da Costa was fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Ma eighth, Sarrazin ninth and Loïc Duval rounded the top ten ahead of qualifying. Duval lost control {{of his car and}} crashed into the turn ten outside barrier's exit, removing both his right-hand side tyres, and caused the session to be stopped for <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> allow his car to be removed from the centre of the track. Engel spun and damaged his right-rear suspension, but was able to drive slowly back to the pit lane. Di Grassi ran wide and went deep into the turn two run-off area. He spun his car to leave the corner but made contact with the wall, removing his rear wing. López lost his vehicle's nose cone in a collision with the wall at the same corner, and his rear wing was removed from his car when he impacted the turn eight barrier. The driver's rear wing was off the racing line, avoiding the need for yellow flags, and Piquet caused the session to conclude under red flag conditions when he heavily collided with the chicane exit barrier.|$|E
5|$|Project E {{modifications}} to Valiants commenced at RAE Farnborough in February 1956. Crew training {{was carried out}} with American instructors at RAF Boscombe Down. The planned V-bomber force had now been reduced to 144 aircraft, and it was planned to equip half of them with Project E weapons. The first 28 Valiants were modified by October 1957; the remaining 20 Valiants, along with 24 Vulcans, were ready by January 1959. Under the Project E Memorandum of Understanding, US personnel had custody of the weapons. That meant they performed all the tasks related to their storage, maintenance and readiness. The bombs were stored in Secure Storage Areas (SSAs) on the same bases as the bombers which British staff were not permitted to enter. It was therefore impossible to store British and Americans bombs {{together in the same}} SSA. Bomber Command designated RAF Marham, RAF Waddington and RAF Honington as bases with US SSAs. Another three sites had British SSAs. US custody created operational problems. The procedure for handing over the bombs added an extra <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> the bombers' reaction time, and the requirement that US personnel had guardianship of the weapons at all times meant that neither they nor the bombers could be relocated to dispersal airfields as the RAF desired.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> go the score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000–01 season Liverpool {{won three}} {{competitions}} {{to complete a}} unique treble of trophies. The first trophy was the League Cup, when they beat Birmingham City 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after the match had finished 1–1. They then won the FA Cup, as Owen scored two goals in the last <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> overturn a one-goal deficit to win the match against Arsenal 2–1. The final trophy the club won was the UEFA Cup. An own goal in the last minute of extra time by Delfí Geli secured a 5–4 victory over Spanish team Alavés. Liverpool finished the league in third place, securing {{a return to the}} European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) {{for the first time since}} the Heysel Stadium disaster. Liverpool's participation in the UEFA Champions League in the 2001–02 season saw the club reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by German team Bayer Leverkusen 4–3 on aggregate. The season was Liverpool's best in the league in recent years, as they finished second, seven points behind Arsenal. Despite their improved performance in the league, Liverpool were unable to defend the FA and League Cup, exiting in the fourth and third rounds respectively. The season was overshadowed by Houllier's heart problems. He suffered chest pain at half-time during a match with Leeds at Anfield. He had an eleven-hour operation to fix an acute dissection of the aorta and did not return until February. His assistant Phil Thompson took charge of the team in the interim.|$|E
