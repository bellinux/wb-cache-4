5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over {{on the side of the}} road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, the Wednesday {{after he}} {{returned}} to the Santa Rosa Beach house, he went up to Vortex Spring again. In the middle of the day, he did one dive. Other divers saw him looking closely at the area around the cave entrance, as if, it was later reported, he was planning something. After resurfacing he filled his tanks at the dive shop, a transaction recorded on security cameras (it is not known what he filled those tanks with). He spent much of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> by himself alongside the spring, witnesses said, testing equipment and making notes in his dive log.|$|E
25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, {{what difference does it make}} whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E

25|$|Bragg {{responded to}} a request by Stevenson for {{reinforcements}} by sending Col. J.T. Holtzclaw's brigade {{under the condition that}} it be used only to cover a Confederate withdrawal from Lookout Mountain, ordering Stevenson at 2:30p.m. to withdraw to the east side of Chattanooga Creek. Stevenson was reluctant to break contact until his troops on the summit could escape on the Summertown Road into the Chattanooga Valley. The brigades of Walthall, Pettus, and Moore were ordered to hold on for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> For hours through the afternoon and into the night, the six Alabama regiments under Pettus and Moore fought sporadically with the Union troops through dense fog, neither side able to see more than a few dozen yards ahead nor make any progress in either direction.|$|E
25|$|As day broke, the Tigris Corps {{found itself}} {{advancing}} through a heavy fog. On left bank, Younghusband's brigades began their {{advance in the}} mid-morning. Approximately two hours into the advance, the brigades paused in their movements to break for lunch. At midday, the fog began to clear and turn into an unseasonably hot day. As the British and Indian battalions were cooking their food, the Ottoman forces launched a spoiling attack. Even though it was driven back, the left bank Tigris Corps' attack on the left bank was further delayed. Eventually, Younghusband's troops reached their positions and launched their attack. However, the objectives of their attack {{turned out to be}} the center of the left bank defenses. Through <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With no cover on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig in for some cover.|$|E
500|$|Right {{after the}} attack, and suspecting that the bombers {{were still on}} the island, the Civil Guard and the National Police Corps {{launched}} a lockdown, an operation named Operation Cage (...) , the biggest manhunt {{in the history of the}} island. Similar operations had been done around Spain in other attacks, such as in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Checkpoints were set up across the island, while the Palma de Mallorca Airport and all ports were temporarily closed. The airport was closed at 4:00 pm and was re-opened at 5:55 pm, with several flights being delayed. During <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the ports were re-opened as well.|$|E

Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas looked and {{suggested}} an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of Under Milk Wood that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards. Reitell later said that Feltenstein was [...] "rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything".|$|E
