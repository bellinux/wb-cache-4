50|$|Weymann's {{system was}} different. The wooden pieces were not {{mortised}} together, but only loosely put {{next to each}} other. The wooden pieces were merely touching each other and its ends were coated in a buffer material (often leather). The wooden pieces were joined together via steel strips. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bodywork</b> wasn't totally firm, but it allowed natural shifts which occur as the wood gets dry or wet. Such shifts {{made it impossible for}} use of metal sheets, therefore the exterior was covered in artificial leather.|$|E

A total of 472 Mancunians were {{ordered by the}} Department between 1965 and 1968 and delivered from 1968 until 1972 by Park Royal, East Lancs, Metro Cammell and Charles H Roe. The first 96 buses ordered (48 each from Leyland and Daimler) used a 30 ft chassis, but the majority were 33 ft long. A further 20 were built for Salford City Transport.|$|E

50|$|Midland Electric milk floats were {{produced}} by Midland Vehicles Ltd of Leamington Spa. Their first design was a 10-15 cwt chassis, which {{was launched in}} January 1937. It was designed by J Parker Garner, {{who at the time}} was a well-known designer, having been involved in the manufacturing of vehicles for a number of years. In early 1938, Midland added a model B20 to their range, which was designed for a 20 cwt payload, but was otherwise very similar to the earlier model. It was showcased at the British Industries Fair, held at Castle Bromwich in February. The vehicle on display consisted of a chassis and a van body which had been cut in half, so that visitors to the show could see both the look of the vehicle and the construction of the chassis. By 1943, Midland Electric were producing five models, which could be fitted with various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>bodywork,</b> including a flat-bed truck for coal deliveries. The B12 catered for a payload of 10-12 cwt, the BA12 for 12-15 cwt, the B20 for 18-22 cwt, the B25 for 25-28 cwt, with the largest model, the B30, suitable for 30-35 cwt. They produced a new 10-cwt lightweight design in 1949, which features an all-welded chassis with an integral body frame. The 10-cwt model was called the Midland Vandot when it was showcased at an exhibition in 1953, organised by the Electric Vehicle Association and the South Eastern Electricity Board. The company was listed in a 1956 directory of electric vehicle manufacturers published in Commercial Motor, but the company closed in 1957.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{particular}} conditions imposed by the Second World War, Mr J Parker Garner, the managing director of Midland Electric, said that there was an increasing demand for larger battery electric vehicles, and to meet this need, they designed a multi-purpose tractor unit. This could pull a trailer loaded with 4 to 4.5 tons, or could carry 35 cwt on the rear platform of the tractor. Commercial Motor examined the use of one such vehicle which had been supplied to the Gloucester Aircraft Co Ltd, where it was used for towing aircraft, and for the transport of aero engines and castings around the factory. The vehicle could be used in areas of the factory where the fire risk from a petrol engine was too great, and it had been adapted so that its batteries could be used for starting aero engines. The reviewed vehicle had a 36-cell battery, rated at 240 Amp-hours, and this gave a range of 30 to 35 mi. The driver had a mechanically operated foot pedal and series/parallel battery switch, providing 10 stages of speed control. This arrangement gave a normal running speed of 10 to 12 mph in series mode and half that in parallel mode. By 1943, Midland Electric were producing five models, which could be fitted with various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>bodywork,</b> including a flat-bed truck for coal deliveries. The B12 catered for a payload of 10-12 cwt, the BA12 for 12-15 cwt, the B20 for 18-22 cwt, the B25 for 25-28 cwt, with the largest model, the B30, suitable for 30-35 cwt. The controller was operated by a foot pedal, and transition between stages was regulated by an air delay mechanism.Maintenance of the motor was made easier by mounting it so that the commutator protruded into the driver's cab. The foot brake acted on all four wheels, while a separate hand brake only acted on the rear wheels. Midland showcased a van with open sides and roll-up canvas screens to the Soft Drinks Industry Protection Association in 1946.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of care for}} older people is provided by informal carers. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> intimate and personal care required has been has been recognised as a form <b>of</b> <b>bodywork</b> (Twigg 2000). Many of the existing studies about bodywork have however, centred primarily on paid workers in nursing or social care. This focus means that {{little is known about}} unpaid family carers’ experiences <b>of</b> <b>bodywork</b> and the associated emotional labour arising from the challenges of caring for older people. This paper draws on a longitudinal, qualitative study which used a grounded theory methodology. Over a period of 28 months, it explored the experiences of carers of older people who were unsupported by formal services and who initially had no help with personal and intimate care. Findings reveal that caregivers are confronted daily with the changing realities <b>of</b> <b>bodywork</b> as they deal with a deteriorating body, increasing levels of dependency and the changing nature of relationships with the care recipient and service providers. The paper argues that younger carers in particular, find <b>bodywork</b> one <b>of</b> the most distressing and challenging parts of their role and that service providers should not assume that carers can manage this aspect of their role with equanimity. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{intimate}} and personal care provided {{for older people}} by informal carers has been recognised as a form <b>of</b> <b>bodywork</b> (Twigg 2000, 2006). While bodywork may not be undertaken by all informal carers, it is central {{to those who are}} at the ‘heavy end’ of caring. Yet many of the existing studies about bodywork have centred primarily on paid carers working in the health and social care sectors (Shakespeare 2003, Twigg 2006). Furthermore, in terms of social work literature and theory, the body is invisible, unproblematised and under-theorised. Bodies are implicit and taken-for-granted while other phenomena, such as emotion, sensation and cognition tend to be overlooked (Cameron and McDermott 2007). These omissions mean that little is known about unpaid carers’ experiences <b>of</b> <b>bodywork</b> and the associated emotions and sensations arising from the challenges of caregiving. This paper highlights the problematic and invisible nature <b>of</b> <b>bodywork.</b> It draws on a longitudinal qualitative study which used a grounded theory methodology to explore the experiences of unsupported carers of older people who initially had no help to provide personal and intimate care. Findings reveal that as caregivers deal with deteriorating and ageing bodies, they are confronted daily with the unpleasant realities <b>of</b> <b>bodywork,</b> with increasing levels of dependency and the changing nature of relationships with care recipients and service providers. The paper argues that younger carers in particular, find <b>bodywork</b> one <b>of</b> the most distressing and challenging parts of their role; that service providers {{need to be aware of}} this issue.
