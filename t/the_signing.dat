40|$|<b>The</b> <b>sign</b> {{problem in}} quantum Monte Carlo {{calculations}} is analyzed using the meron-cluster solution. The concept of merons {{can be used}} to solve <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> problem for a limited class of models.

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies.

The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After <b>the</b> <b>signing</b> of the Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by <b>the</b> <b>signing</b> of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
