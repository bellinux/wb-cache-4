25|$|At 2330 hours 14 September, forward {{elements}} of GM 32 captured Paksong. The PAVN 9th Regiment, threatened from the south, east, and west, withdrew {{to the northeast}} along Route 23 on the 15th. A few PAVN soldiers still remained secreted in Paksong for GM 32 <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> out. Seven kilometers from town they posted a rear guard to fortify a hilltop position overwatching the road. Leaving another contingent in the agricultural research station, the 9th retreated toward Thateng. Political pressure from Vientiane was being {{brought to bear on}} the operation's commanding officer, as the Royal Lao Armed Forces had suffered almost 1,000 casualties {{in the past two months}} in MR 4.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} literary reference <b>to</b> <b>Grub</b> Street {{appears in}} 1630, by the English poet, John Taylor. [...] "When strait I might descry, The Quintescence of Grubstreet, well distild Through Cripplegate in a contagious Map". [...] The local population {{was known for}} its nonconformist views; its Presbyterian preacher Samuel Annesley had been replaced in 1662 by an Anglican. [...] Famous 16th-century Puritans included John Foxe, who may have authored his Book of Martyrs in the area, the historian John Speed, the Protestant printer and poet Robert Crowley. [...] The Protestant John Milton also lived near Grub Street.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the Dictionarys {{critical}} acclaim, Johnson's general {{financial situation}} continued in its dismal fashion {{for some years}} after 1755: [...] "The image of Johnson racing to write Rasselas {{to pay for his}} mother's funeral, romantic hyperbole though it is, conveys the precariousness of his existence, almost four years after his work on the Dictionary was done. His financial uncertainties continued. He gave up the house in Gough Square in March 1759, probably for lack of funds. Yet, just as Johnson was plunging into another trough of despondency, the reputation of the Dictionary at last brought reward. In July 1762 Johnson was granted a state pension of £300 a year by the twenty-four-year-old monarch, George III. The pension did not make him rich, but it ensured he would no longer have <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> around for the odd guinea." ...|$|E

50|$|Aquatic species {{use either}} {{internal}} or external fertilization. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but scorpions give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults <b>to</b> <b>grubs</b> and caterpillars that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total metamorphosis to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.|$|R

6000|$|I {{asked him}} to get some black spruce root and make some thread.
