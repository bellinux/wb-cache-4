5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, it is probable that more Persians were killed as <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E

The American troops fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte-Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates. This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.|$|E
5|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} were living near the ghetto {{on the day he}} was shot. A Jewish policeman informed them that Gens had been shot and that the Gestapo was looking for them. <b>They</b> <b>fled</b> and managed to stay in hiding until Soviet troops arrived.

5|$|In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov {{also writes}} {{that at the}} time, the church lacked a roof. He {{references}} {{a story about a}} group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War (1853–1856). According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them fell to his death inside the church, so <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> in horror. The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov.|$|E

5|$|Lladron Maelrhys are {{two large}} stones {{on the border}} between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw. It is claimed that, years ago, thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church, intent on {{stealing}} money. Caught in the act, <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> for their lives but were caught as they approached Y Rhiw, and killed on the spot; the stones mark their burial place. Another version claims that as they crossed the parish boundary they were turned to stone for their sacrilege.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, due to {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} situation and communications difficulties, a degree of confusion emerged on both sides. Out of contact with their corps headquarters, the 4th Krajina Division continued to retain two brigades along the Bihać-Petrovac road, {{despite the fact that}} the 92nd Motorised Regiment had already passed along this route and into their rear. The critically important Petrovac-Ključ road to the south was left unguarded, endangering Tito and Supreme Partisan Headquarters as <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> from Drvar.|$|E
5|$|The HV offensives {{in western}} Slavonia {{conducted}} in late 1991 (Operations Hurricane-10, Swath-10 and Papuk-91) created {{a total of}} 20,000 Serb refugees. <b>They</b> <b>fled</b> the area when the JNA ordered Croatian Serb forces to withdraw, and were settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The refugee resettlement coincided with Croatian Serb efforts to change the ethnic composition of the Danube area seized in late 1991, providing a secondary motive for the expulsion of non-Serb civilians.|$|E

5|$|To prevent Jewish {{violence}} from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful {{speech to the}} crowd in the company of his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces. <b>They</b> <b>fled</b> the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the twelfth legion, but was unable to restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|With this {{arrangement}} settled, the Mongols attacked the alliance's army and routed it. The Mongols {{then proceeded to}} attack the Cumans, who had split into two separate groups as they were returning home, destroying both armies and executing all the prisoners before sacking Astrakhan.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 119–20* Gabriel, Subotai The Valiant: Genghis Khan's Greatest General, p. 97 The Mongols began pursuing the Cumans as <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> in a north-westerly direction.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu {{and several other}} {{prominent}} officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. <b>They</b> <b>fled</b> to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia {{turned a blind eye}} to Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E

5|$|After the {{successful}} {{assault on the}} northern wall, the defenders fled to the Temple Mount, pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Tancred then called {{a halt to the}} slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection. When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Provençals to enter the city. Iftikhar al-Dawla, the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to Ascalon.|$|E
5|$|Athamas {{ruled in}} Boeotia {{and had a}} {{complicated}} family life, several details of which {{are known to have}} played part in the Catalogue. His first children were Phrixus and Helle, whose mother was Nephele. In what was the first episode of the Argonautic saga, she gave her children a ram with a golden fleece upon which <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> the intrigues of their stepmother Ino according to other sources. Athamas was driven mad by the gods, perhaps because he took the young Dionysus into his household, and slaughtered his and Ino's son Learchus; Ino herself jumped into the sea with their son Melicertes and became the sea-goddess Leucothea. At some point before his marriage to Ino, Athamas had sired Leucon and Schoeneus by Themisto, and Leucon's daughters Peisidice, Euippe and Hyperippe were given extended group treatment in the Catalogue.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Spedding {{was awarded}} a Guggenheim Fellowship, {{allowing}} him to study in Europe. To save money, Spedding and his wife travelled to Europe by heading westward across the Pacific. His intention was to study in Germany under James Franck and Francis Simon, but <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> Germany after Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} March 1933. Instead he went to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he was welcomed by Ralph H. Fowler. Spedding worked with John Lennard-Jones, and attended lectures given by Max Born. He paid a visit to Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, and gave a lecture in Leningrad.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during the weeks before or after that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples. The Portuguese that lived in Angola accounted {{for the majority of}} the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, and industry; once <b>they</b> <b>fled</b> the country, the national economy began to sink into depression.|$|E
5|$|In the Bjelovar Corps AOR, two battalions of the 125th Home Guard Regiment {{crossed the}} Sava River near Jasenovac, secured a {{bridgehead}} for trailing HV units and advanced towards Hrvatska Dubica. The two battalions {{were followed by}} an additional company of the same regiment, a battalion of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment, the 265th Reconnaissance Company and finally the 24th Home Guard Regiment battlegroup. A reconnaissance platoon of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment crossed the Sava River into the Republika Srpska, established a bridgehead for two infantry companies and subsequently demolished the Bosanska DubicaGradiška road before returning to Croatian soil. The Bjelovar Corps units reached the outskirts of Hrvatska Dubica before nightfall. That night, the town of Hrvatska Dubica was abandoned by the ARSK troops and the civilian population. <b>They</b> <b>fled</b> south across the Sava River into Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II ordered Hadım Suleiman Pasha, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, {{to invade}} Moldavia – an Ottoman army of about 120,000 strong broke into Moldavia in late 1475.
