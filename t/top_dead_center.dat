Primary sensors {{on the system}} are crankshaft angle (crankshaft or <b>Top</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Center</b> (TDC) position), airflow into the engine and throttle position. The circuitry determines which cylinder needs fuel and how much, opens the requisite injector to deliver it, then causes a spark {{at the right moment}} to burn it. Early EMS systems used an analogue computer to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with the}} changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|E

40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{developing}} a free-piston engine as an innovative internal combustion engine for the generation of electrical power. The arrangement of the Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG) in opposed-piston design consists of two piston units oscillating freely, thereby alternately compressing the common combustion chamber {{in the center of}} the unit and gas springs on either side. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving pistons into electric energy. Since the pistons are not mechanically coupled to a crank train, the bottom and <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centers</b> of the piston movement can be varied during operation e. g. to adjust the compression ratio. Utilizing these degrees of freedom, the present paper deals with the analysis of different combustion processes in a port scavenged opposed-piston combustion chamber prototype. This contains the experimental investigation of spark ignition (SI) as well as the transition to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Based on test bench results, a 3 D-CFD model, which has been used to develop the first prototype, is calibrated by actual measurements. The simulation results enable a deeper analysis of scavenging and in-cylinder processes exceeding the measurement possibilities on a test bench...|$|R

The detailed parameters relating to engine friction and lubrication are computed numerically for the engine firing order 1 - 3 - 4 - 2. The numerical method is based on finite difference method that solves coupled Reynolds Equation and Energy Equation. Output includes the movie thickness, friction force, friction power loss and temperature rise in the ring liner conjunction in all four cylinders. Transient regime of ring liner lubrication isaddressed while the same changes from hydrodynamic to mixed in an engine cycle.

Previously the <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> was 3 cm and before that 5 cm,and before that 10 cm. The reason for {{reducing}} {{the size of the}} <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> is to have more separation between the top competitors. If two or more competitors have the same score they do re-jumps until a winner is found. Smaller <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> makes it more difficult and less likely to many with the same score.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} pneumatic valve springs a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds, also by narrowing the connecting rod ends allowing for narrower main bearings. This allows for higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a null speed, to almost two times the mean speed, (approximately 40m/s) then back to zero. This occurs once {{for each of the four}} strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). [...] Maximum piston acceleration occurs at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> and is in the region of 95,000m/s2, about 10,000 times standard gravity or 10,000g.|$|E
2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest mean effective pressure, however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (TDC), and longer intake ducts, improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due {{to the absence of}} throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the side}} rods (UK: {{coupling}} rods) of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, piston rods, main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both cylinders are at <b>top</b> or bottom <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> simultaneously. A four-cylinder locomotive can be completely balanced in the longitudinal and vertical axes, although there are some rocking and twisting motions which can be dealt with in the locomotive's suspension and centering; a three-cylinder locomotive can also be better balanced, but a two-cylinder locomotive only balanced for rotation will surge fore and aft. Additional balance weight — [...] "overbalance" [...] — can be added to damp this, but at the cost of adding vertical forces, which are known technically as [...] "dynamic augment" [...] and colloquially as [...] "hammer blow". This can be extremely damaging to the track, and in extreme cases can actually cause the driving wheels to leave the track entirely. The heavier the reciprocating machinery, the greater these forces are, and the greater a problem this becomes.|$|R
