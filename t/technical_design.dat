5|$|Fordham College at Rose Hill has a {{long history}} of college theater, as well as non-major theater groups at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill (the Mimes and Mummers, Fordham Experimental Theater, the Theatrical Outreach Group, Splinter Group). There are also choirs (University Choir, Schola Cantorum, Gloria Dei Choir) and a cappella groups {{spanning}} both campuses (Fordham Ramblers, Satin Dolls, b-Sides, Hot Notes, F-sharps). The Mimes and Mummers, the oldest entirely student-run club at Fordham University and among the oldest college theater groups in the United States, was founded in 1855 as the Saint John's Dramatic Society. The Mimes put on two musicals, a drama, and a comedy each year – all non-student-written shows – as well as workshops designed to help students at Fordham learn about theater. The club receives from the school a budget which allows the hiring of professional directors, music directors, and choreographers but the shows are student produced, with all elements of <b>technical</b> <b>design</b> run by the club's executive board.|$|E

40|$|Online {{games are}} {{extremely}} large and complex systems, which require careful consideration of scalability solutions. The major areas requiring such solutions are in data storage, code organization, and networking. To solve these issues, game development studios need to level up their <b>technical</b> <b>designs.</b> Leveling up a design entails deploying improvement strategies {{that make the}} game system more robust and reliable than any previous system the game development studio has ever created.

25|$|Notes {{from his}} lectures {{indicate}} that, {{at the start}} of his time in the Mediterranean, useful working ranges for heavy guns without telescopic sights were considered to be only 2000 yards, or 3000–4000 yards with such sights, whereas {{by the end of his}} time discussion centred on how to shoot effectively at 5000 yards. This was driven by the increasing range of the torpedo, which had now risen to 3000–4000 yards, necessitating ships fighting effectively at greater ranges. At this time he advocated relatively small main armaments on capital ships (some had 15inch or greater), because the improved <b>technical</b> <b>design</b> of the relatively small (10inch) modern guns allowed a much greater firing rate and greater overall weight of broadside. The potentially much greater ranges of large guns was not an issue, because no one knew how to aim them effectively at such ranges. He argued that 'the design of fighting ships must follow the mode of fighting instead of fighting being subsidiary to and dependent on the design of ships.'. As regards how officers needed to behave, he commented, 'Think and act for yourself' is the motto for the future, not 'Let us wait for orders'.|$|E

500|$|With the {{approval}} of the specifications, TsKB-17, the heavy-ship design bureau, began work on the sketch design to be submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers {{before the start of the}} <b>technical</b> <b>design</b> could begin. By March 1949, four alternatives had been completed, differing mainly in the arrangement of the 130mm guns and the boiler layout. The bureau preferred one layout and the Navy and the Shipbuilding Ministry concurred so the bureau began the <b>technical</b> <b>design,</b> without formal approval, in order to be ready to lay down the first two ships in the third quarter of 1950 as already scheduled. However, when Stalin reviewed the sketch design in September 1949, he rejected it, ordering a smaller, faster ship capable of [...] TsKB-17 was able to produce a preliminary <b>technical</b> <b>design</b> that met Stalin's demands by the end of the year, an amazingly fast amount of time for what should have been a very involved process. The most likely explanation is that the designers retained as much of their original work as possible and found room for the more powerful turbines and more numerous boilers necessary to attain Stalin's specified speed by deleting the two rear twin 130mm turrets, and their magazines, as revealed by a comparison of the 1949 and 1951 sketches.|$|E

500|$|This {{allowed the}} <b>technical</b> <b>design</b> process to begin {{and it was}} {{completed}} in December 1950. Reviews by the Navy and Shipbuilding Ministries in February 1951 led to some significant changes to the design in April. The original form of the bow {{was similar to that}} of the Chapayev-class light cruisers, but sea trials of the lead ship of that class in December 1950 – January 1951 proved that she was very wet forward, which hindered her seakeeping ability. The Stalingrads bow form was radically altered with a much more raked stem, its sheer and flare were greatly increased and the ship gained almost [...] in length, possibly in response to the Chapayevs problems. In addition the thickness of her belt armor was increased from , possibly in response to weight savings elsewhere. This final design was submitted for approval on 4 June 1951, but preparations for the working design drawings began before it was approved.|$|E
