40|$|Capítulos en librosIn this paper, the {{performance}} of a thermoelectric module is analysed using the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>diagram</b> Temperature-Entropy. This diagram {{can be used as a}} graphical tool which allows for the analysis of thermoelectric processes, both reversible and non-reversible, in an elemental pair or thermoelectric elements. A similarity is found between the Seebeck coefficient and entropy per unit of electrical charge. This allows for the use of the Seebeck coefficient and absolute temperature as coordinates in a representative Cartesian system. All processes, both reversible and non-reversible, in a pair of thermoelectric elements can be represented in the above mentioned system. This analysis is completed with the identification of several graphic elements such as lines and areas, and their association to different equations and thermodynamic relationships of the thermoelectric module performance. This approach is very useful in the analysis of thermoelectric modules as it is performed from an engineering point of view in classical thermodynamics. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{ability of}} the laser plasma plume during in situ formation of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x (YBaCuO) thin films has been studied {{as a function of}} the deposition conditions. A quenching technique has been used immediately after termination of growth to avoid any oxygen in or out-diffusion during the cooling down step. It is shown that superconducting YBaCuO thin films can be formed without any post-oxygenation procedure, contrary to that expected from the (PO 2, T) <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>diagram.</b> This is due to the production of oxygen activated species in the plume, which significantly increases the oxygen potential and, therefore, the oxidation state of the films during deposition. Moreover, it is demonstrated that there exits an optimal position of the substrate respecting to the visible luminous plume for each O 2 pressure, which leads to the highest Tc and to the best structural and morphological properties of quenched films. It is concluded that the presence of active oxygen, which is not homogeneously distributed over space, enhances the surface reaction kinetics and, thus, plays an important role in the mechanism of growth of laser ablated YBaCuO films. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{first part}} of this work is {{dedicated}} to an experimental investigation of the C–Hf–O system and in particular to the stability domain of the HfCxOy oxycarbide phase formed through the carbothermal reduction in HfO 2 by carbon black at 1650 and 1750 °C. This study which has been carried out by coupling chemical elemental analysis of powder with a structural approach by X-ray powder diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) shows that the solid solution of the oxygen ranges from HfC 0. 98 ± 0. 01 O 0. 02 ± 0. 03 to HfC 0. 90 ± 0. 01 O 0. 10 ± 0. 03 at 1650 °C and from HfC 0. 97 ± 0. 01 O 0. 03 ± 0. 03 to HfC 0. 89 ± 0. 01 O 0. 11 ± 0. 03 at 1750 °C. It was then concluded that contrary with earlier previous results from the literature, the stability field of the solid solution is very limited and not very sensitive to temperature. This behavior is also in contrast with results obtained on the ZrCxOy oxycarbide which shows an isostructural form of HfCxOy. The second part of the paper reports on the first modeling of the ternary <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>diagram</b> of the C–Hf–O system by the CALPHAD method. The accurate data experimentally obtained on the solid solution were integrated as diagrammatic data for the calculation. The modeling was based on from already published binary assessments after a selection of compatible binary models and the description of the HfCxOy solid solution was then added and optimized using the data of this work. As a result, a set of coherent parameters has been obtained, allowing to calculate isothermal sections of this C–Hf–O ternary system...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Time series of 1 Hz vertical velocity data collected during penetrations by research aircraft of oceanic cumulonimbus clouds near tropical Australia as part of the Equatorial Mesoscale Experiment (EMEX) are analyzed for updraft and downdraft events called cores. A core is defined whenever the vertical velocity exceeds for at least 500 m. Over 19000 km of straight and level flight legs are used in the analysis. 511 updraft cores and 253 downdraft cores are included in the data set. Core properties are summarized as distributions of average and maximum vertical velocity, diameter and mass flux in four altitude intervals between 0. 2 km and 5. 8 km. Distributions were approximately lognormal at all levels. Comparisons with other studies which use the same analysis technique reveal that EMEX cores have approximately the same strength, diameter, and mass flux as the cores of other oceanic areas, despite differences in the large-scale environment. Oceanic cores are much weaker than cores observed over land as part of the Thunderstorm Project. estimate of virtual temperature excess is made for the portion of the cores between 4. 3 and 5. 8 km using a C 02 radiometer. Median observed average excesses are found to be slightly positive for both updraft and downdraft cores and much lower than what is predicted by simple parcel theory. TAMEX cores also showed this result. Examination of the variations of the statistics with height suggests a maximum of vertical velocity between 2 and 3 km; slightly lower vertical velocity is indicated at 5 km. The vertical velocity statistics are considered {{in the context of the}} environmental soundings. It is suggested that the shape of the positive area on a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>diagram,</b> combined with water loading, can help explain the observed differences of the strength of the cores between the continents and oceans...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} {{on the development of}} the molecular beacon, as a new DNA probe for DNA genotyping, D N A computation and biophysical studies of DNA conformations. Molecular beacons are single-stranded DNA molecules that form a stem-and-loop structure. A fluorophore and a quencher are grafted at their two ends to report their conformations: when the molecular beacon is closed, fluorophore and quencher are held in close proximity and the fluorescence is quenched; when the molecular beacon is open, fluorophore and quencher are far apart, and the fluorescence is restored. Molecular beacons are ideal DNA probes coupling conformational switch with fluorescence signal turning-ON. We use molecular beacons to study the molecular recognition of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide. We present a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>diagram</b> to show that structural constraints make the molecular beacon highly sensitive to the presence of mismatches in its target. We introduce a sequence sensitivity parameter to quantitatively compare different DNA probes, and propose an algorithm to optimally tune the probe 2 ̆ 7 s structure for enhanced sequence discrimination. Logic gates (OR and AND gates) using molecular beacons are designed to carry most elementary molecular computations. The conformational changes associated with such computations can be used to concatenate many chemical reactions, and carry out complex molecular computations. Molecular beacons are also ideal probes to study DNA secondary structures and their fluctuations. We develop the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) technique to monitor the dynamics of relaxation of DNA conformational fluctuations. We first measure the opening and closing timescales of DNA hairpin-loops. Activation barriers for opening and closing for different loop lengths and sequences are analyzed to better account for the stability of DNA secondary structures. A sequence dependent rigidity of ssDNA has been discovered, and analyzed in terms of base stacking. We then use F C S to study the dynamics of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breathing modes with synthetic DNA constructs. The analysis of the base pairing fluctuation dynamics, monitored by fluorescence, unravels lifetimes of breathing modes ranging from 1 /us to 1 ms. Long-range distortions of the d s DNA have been unraveled for purine-rich sequences, of relevance to the specificity of transcription initiation in prokaryotes...|$|E
