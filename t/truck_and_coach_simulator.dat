In the ensuing years, the number of car lines produced has changed several times. GMC <b>Truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>Coach</b> Division shared Baltimore's truck production {{as early as the}} 1947 model year.|$|R

5000|$|In 1925, GM {{purchased}} a controlling interest in Yellow Coach, a bus manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois {{which was founded}} by John D. Hertz. After purchasing the remaining portion in 1943, GM renamed it GM <b>Truck</b> <b>and</b> <b>Coach</b> Division. The Division manufactured interurban coaches until 1980. Transit bus production ended in May 1987. The Canadian plant (in London, Ontario) produced buses from 1962 until July 1987. GM withdrew from the bus <b>and</b> <b>coach</b> market because of increased competition in the late 1970s and 1980s. Rights to the RTS model were sold to Transportation Manufacturing Corporation, while Motor Coach Industries of Canada purchased the Classic design.

50|$|Passo Giau is {{comprised}} {{in the territories}} of Colle Santa Lucia, San Vito di Cadore and Cortina d'Ampezzo, in addition for a few hundred meters in the territory of Selva di Cadore. The road that goes up from Colle Santa Lucia has 29 tornanti and 3 tunnels for protection against avalanches, while the side towards Cortina is more easily passable. It is an interesting alternative to get to Cortina from Agordino area also because the road of Passo Giau, unlike the Passo Falzarego road is passable by <b>trucks</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches.</b> However, despite the efforts made over the years, the winter season is often compromised by the avalanches that come down to block the uncovered parts of the road.|$|R
50|$|Pegaso was an {{established}} company {{noted for its}} <b>trucks</b> <b>and</b> motor <b>coaches,</b> but also produced sports cars for seven years.

5000|$|Semi-automatic {{transmissions}} {{have also}} {{made their way into}} the <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> bus market in the early 2000s. Volvo offers its I-Shift on its heavier <b>trucks</b> <b>and</b> buses, while ZF markets its ASTronic system for <b>trucks,</b> buses <b>and</b> <b>coaches.</b> In North America, Eaton offers the [...] "AutoShift" [...] system which is an add-on to traditional non-synchromesh manual transmissions for heavy trucks. These gearboxes have a place in public transport as they have been shown to reduce fuel consumption in some specific cases.|$|R
