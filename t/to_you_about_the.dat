2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, I do want to talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Today, {{a senior member of}} Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, {{targeted}} assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing {{at a time when the}} United States seems absent in the peace-making process. What would your administration do? First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? ...|$|E
2500|$|Asquith {{followed}} this {{by agreeing to}} hold Commissions of Inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} Dardanelles and of the Mesopotamian campaign, where Allied forces had been forced to surrender at Kut. Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary to the War Committee, considered that; [...] "the Coalition never recovered. For (its) last five months, the function of the Supreme Command was carried out under the shadow of these inquests." [...] But these mistakes were overshadowed by the limited progress and immense casualties of the Battle of the Somme, which began on 1 July 1916, and then by another devastating personal loss, the death of Asquith's son Raymond, on 15 September at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. Asquith's relationship with his eldest son had not been easy. Raymond wrote to his wife in early 1916; [...] "If Margot talks any more bosh <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inhumanity of her stepchildren you can stop her mouth by telling her that during my 10 months exile here the P.M. has never written me a line of any description." [...] But Raymond's death was shattering, Violet writing; [...] "…to see Father suffering so wrings one", and Asquith passed much of the following months [...] "withdrawn and difficult to approach". The War brought no respite, Churchill writing that; [...] "The failure to break the German line in the Somme, the recovery of the Germanic powers in the East , the ruin of Roumania and the beginnings of renewed submarine warfare strengthened and stimulated all those forces which insisted upon still greater vigour in the conduct of affairs." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "We {{also have}} good news <b>to</b> tell <b>you,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> promise made <b>to</b> our ancestors" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{this is all}} I {{am going}} <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fuss in the big pine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always, even if I come <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> work. I don't want {{anything}} to do with love when I'm at work. Work's work--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dash it all, sir," [...] went on George presently, [...] "I may as {{well get}} it out; I hev come to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Squire's business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't!" [...] she {{answered}} indignantly. [...] "I've come to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mare, and you'll just treat me decently or I'll know the reason why!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{distress}} you," [...] I began. [...] "I {{will only}} ask leave, before {{we change the}} subject, to put one question <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cottage and the lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But this is {{a holiday}} trip," [...] I {{reminded}} him. [...] "Surely I may be permitted <b>to</b> advise <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> picturesque spots in my own country!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] Deane answered. [...] "They need a {{more subtle}} brain than yours, I am afraid. I have come <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is a great}} {{satisfaction}} <b>to</b> have <b>you</b> back in {{your old}} home, under our wing. I have a great deal <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> arrangements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like to talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{growth of}} real estate out beyond your Grantsville warehouse. I {{might be able to}} tip you off to a thing or two, possibly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Janet," [...] {{said her}} mother, {{in a voice}} of grave reproof, [...] "I simply came to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{distressing}} loss of what your father put in my charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{to speak}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lessons {{you are to}} make up," [...] said Job Haskers, after {{clearing}} his throat several times. [...] "I understand that you want more time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not as I’ve ’eard of," [...] said Joe, {{stepping}} inside. [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it; <b>the</b> sooner it’s {{found the}} better I shall be pleased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} mother. [...] "I am going <b>to</b> explain <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> air, {{and then you}} must write down what I tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|But before {{considering}} {{how we are}} to draw this enclosing line, I must state <b>to</b> <b>you</b> something <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of lines in general, by different schools.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can you say}} so. Gerald? Did you {{not know}} that you ought not to scribble in books? Can you say that Miss Morley has not often spoken <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Atlas?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dill, I {{want to talk}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{time you}} {{were out in the}} South Seas," [...] said Dave, who could bear the {{suspense}} no longer. [...] "Now, please follow me closely, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Lumpy, {{with his}} eyes still fixed on the earnest little face of Eve. [...] "Mister Jay sent me to say he wants to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> heel o' the noo bowsprit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your substitute, child. Stephens {{attended}} {{to the business}} for me, and he's off to-morrow. I began <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fellow last week, but you were wool-gathering, so I stopped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{will explain}} {{presently}} how this connection between Davidson and that fellow came about. Now I want <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{part of this}} affair which happened here—the preliminaries of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{keep you}} long from 'The Bloody Thumb' {{or any other}} catastrophic affairs," [...] said Father Brown, smiling. [...] "I only came <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> crime <b>you</b> {{committed}} this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must try}} to be brave," [...] she smiled up at him at length. [...] "And you are my trustee. Please bring those papers I laid down. I suppose I must talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> farm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--no indeed; that is, not exactly; not to-day, Herr Trendellsohn. The truth is, I had {{wished to}} speak {{a word or}} two <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> maiden; but perhaps you are engaged--perhaps another time would be better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brother Peter," [...] he said, in a wheedling yet gravely {{official}} tone, [...] "It's {{nothing but}} right I should speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Three Crofts and the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I've {{got on my}} mind--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Baker, timidly. [...] "Here it is; and I {{have come}} up <b>to</b> consult <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> answer." [...] Mr. Bertram now did take the letter, and did read it through.|$|R
6000|$|... "A very {{eccentric}} man indeed, remarkably so, for a kindly, honest man," [...] thought Mr Jack; {{but he only}} said, [...] "I {{came here}} <b>to</b> consult <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> investment of two thousand pounds--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Acton smiled dryly. [...] "Any way," [...] he said, [...] "they're as {{straight}} as most. It's not a business that's conducive to unswerving rectitude. Hutton has come up here <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Elgood {{has been}} here this afternoon," [...] she said, [...] "from Sheffield. He is the {{secretary}} of the Union, you know. He is coming again to-morrow morning. He wants to talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> boys' age limit." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{have paid}} me many compliments, and I like {{to listen to}} compliments. I indorse all your {{chairman}} has said <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> union of England and America. He also alluded to my name, of which I am rather fond.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder where}} {{they are to be}} found," [...] said the waiting-woman, with some asperity; [...] "but I believe, Master Wingate, if one were to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> devil himself, you would say there were worse people than Satan." ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. I've {{thought of}} nursing, but it's a long training, and I do so hate {{watching}} pain. The fact is, I'm pretty hopeless; can't even do art work. I came <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have called, Mr Hitchin," [...] he began, [...] "not <b>to</b> trouble <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{matter which}} displeased {{you when we}} conversed {{together}} on the beach, but <b>to</b> warn <b>you</b> of a danger which I fear threatens yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man we rescued in the woods, Ruth," [...] he said. [...] "Probably {{you know}} him. His name is Stevenson, {{although}} {{he said he}} was usually called Uncle Barney by all who knew him." ...|$|R
