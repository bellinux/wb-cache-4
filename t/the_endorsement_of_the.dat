5|$|A related {{experiment}} {{which also}} had Teller's endorsement {{was a plan}} to extract oil from the tar sands in northern Alberta with nuclear explosions, titled Project Oilsands. The plan actually received <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alberta government, but {{was rejected by the}} Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to have nuclear weapons, from a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E

5|$|After the 1922 elections, Cotillo {{became the}} {{chairman}} of the influential State Senate Judiciary Committee, a sign of his rising authority. The post helped him to get ready for a next step. In 1924, he was the first Italian-born to become Justice of the New York Supreme Court, First District, where he would he remain until his death. He was elected with <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tammany Hall political machine, many social welfare organizations and organized labor, the Citizen's Union and several bar organizations.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to the trails in Iowa.

5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Daily News—one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, she ran for an eighteen-person {{contest for}} four Columbus School Board seats on a {{platform}} that included proposing to lengthen the scholastic day from {{six and a half}} hours to eight.

When Silva left city council and was elected a federal Liberal Member of Parliament in Davenport in the 2004 federal election, Giambrone became a leading candidate to replace him in the 2003 municipal election. With <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Star, Now Magazine, Bloor West Villager newspapers and councillors Joe Pantalone and Fred Dominelli, Giambrone defeated Ana Bailão, Silva's former assistant, by a 51-40 margin {{in a field of}} six candidates.|$|R

25|$|Though Dean lagged {{in early}} endorsements, he {{acquired}} many critical ones as his campaign snowballed. By <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iowa caucuses, he led among commitments from superdelegates– {{elected officials and}} party officers entitled to convention votes {{by virtue of their}} positions. On November 12, 2003, he received <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Service Employees International Union and <b>the</b> American Federation <b>of</b> State, County and Municipal Employees. Dean received <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> former Vice President and 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore, on December 9, 2003.

25|$|The October {{surprise}} of the election was <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democrat Douglas by former Whig John J. Crittenden.

25|$|Johnson {{garnered}} <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento Police Officers Association (SPOA), the Region Builders, the Chamber of Commerce, Realtors' Association and Labor Council, among others.

25|$|Fulani {{also sought}} <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peace and Freedom Party of California, but despite winning a {{majority}} in that party's primary, she would lose the nomination to Ronald Daniels, the former Director the National Rainbow Coalition. Rather than pursuing a ballot space of her own, Fulani would endorse Daniels's candidacy in California.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, Critz {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. The next day, Burns {{received the}} endorsement of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty.

50|$|Flaherty out-polled Thornburgh by double-digit margins {{for much}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign, but the Republican {{candidate}} used highly effective strategies {{to close the}} gap in {{the weeks leading up to}} election night. Thornburgh was successful in recruiting suburban moderates, as fellow moderate Republican Specter encouraged his metro Philadelphia supporters to rally behind Thornburgh. In contrast, the liberal Flaherty had trouble reaching out to conservative Democrats outside of his Western Pennsylvania base, a problem hindered by Casey's tepid support for the candidate over the lieutenant gubernatorial issue. Thornburgh also aggressively courted traditionally Democratic-leaning groups and gained <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NAACP and several labor unions. Democratic support slowly waned under this strategy, which allowed Thornburgh to take a close victory.|$|R
50|$|During his 1940 campaign, Willkie had {{pledged to}} {{integrate}} the civil service and armed forces, and proudly pointed to what he deemed the strongest civil rights plank in history in the Republican platform. He also promised to end racial segregation in Washington, D.C. He gained <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two largest African American newspapers, the Pittsburgh Courier and the Baltimore Afro-American. With Willkie running to <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> Roosevelt on civil rights, Roosevelt feared that blacks would return to their traditional home in the Republican Party, and he secured several prominent promotions or hirings of African Americans. Roosevelt was successful in keeping <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black vote. After the election, Willkie promised to keep fighting for civil rights.|$|R
