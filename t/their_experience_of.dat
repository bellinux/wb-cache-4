5|$|After <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> {{the perils}} and {{obstacles}} of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by}} a newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{violence}} against women include sexual harassment and abuse by authority figures (such as teachers, police officers or employers), trafficking for forced labour or sex, and traditional practices such as forced child marriages and dowry-related violence. At its most extreme, violence against women can result in female infanticide and violent death. Despite {{the size of the}} problem, many women do not report <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> abuse and do not seek help. As a result, violence against women remains a hidden problem with great human and health care costs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} stage of the war the Regiment was {{assigned}} to the Headquarters of the Emperor, and one squadron was the personal guard of Marshal Davout. Chevaulegers acted from time to time as a military police unit. They also fought near Wilno, Mohylew and Smoleńsk. During the Battle of Borodino they were kept in reserve. Only one squadron went to Moscow with Napoleon (the rest of them followed a few days later). Some fifty chevaulegers-lancers escorted the Emperor from the burning Kremlin, covering him - in the most critical moment - with their overcoats. With <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the severity of winters in Eastern Europe, the chevaulegers, when leaving Moscow, had their horses fitted with ice-horseshoes.|$|E
25|$|Members {{describe}} {{their sense of}} relaxation and liberation, and the increasing value of restraint and modesty in their lives.

At the same time, personal responsibility replaces self-pity and the expectation that others will act {{for the good of}} the individual. With these old attitudes, egocentricity and exaggerated, false self-confidence perpetuate the problem which led them to join OA. While their eating disorder was active, many OA members claimed that <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> self was composed of an obsessive aspiration for perfection which concealed their sense of worthlessness.|$|E

25|$|The antecedents can {{be traced}} back to the Romantics of the 19th century as well as some Enlightenment {{political}} economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by Thomas Malthus, while John Stuart Mill predicted the desirability of the stationary state of an economy. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the social and ecological costs of the Post–World War II economic expansion. As Martinez-Alier explores in his book the debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced into the 19th century e.g. Nobel prize-winning chemist, Frederick Soddy (1877–1956). Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism echoed by his intellectual heirs in the now emergent field of ecological economics.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{focus in}} the {{curriculum}} begins on day one, {{in the introduction to}} being a physician course. Students interview patients about <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> illness and experiences with their physicians, and they visit community settings to develop an understanding of their roles as medical professionals. Medical interviewing and physical examination courses follow, along with exercises examining the many facets of physician life—in society, ethical settings, and at the patient bedside. Throughout the first two years, students apply their new skills in local practices and hospitals one afternoon per week. The basic science block runs through three-fourths of the first year and provides language and concepts that underlie the scientific basis of medical practice. Organ system block courses integrate physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and patient with concurrent courses in the patient care and patient, physician and society blocks. Weekly discussions, patient interviews, and examination of hospitalized patients reinforce essential clinical skills.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 117 - 128. Woman {{abuse is}} a {{pervasive}} social problem {{and there is}} a paucity of South African research exploring women's <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> violence. This study focused on how women endure abusive relationships by examining how women construct and give meaning to <b>their</b> <b>experiences,</b> within a particular socio-cultural context. Interviews were conducted with 15 participants who volunteered participation in response to advertisements. All research participants resided in Mitchell's Plain or surrounding areas. In-depth, narrative interviews were used to investigate women's <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> violence from <b>their</b> partners. The interview topics included women's daily concerns and problems, <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> and responses to their partners' violence, and their feelings toward their partners and staying in the relationships. The interviews lasted approximately one to two hours and were tape-recorded and transcribed. The interview data was analysed by utilising a narrative approach, taking the content of women's stories into account. A close attention to language and discourse also shaped the analysis of women's narratives. In their narratives, women named <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> violation and abuse, explored the impact of abuse, and discussed their help-seeking attempts. Women also constructed particular gendered identities for themselves and their partners. Hegemonic gendered identities were sometimes adopted or resisted and reflected contradictory subjective experiences. This study showed how women in abusive relationships utilised a variety of strategies to end the violence in their lives and challenged constructions of women as passive victims of abuse. The meanings women attached to <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> abuse were filtered through the particular socio-cultural context (characterised by poverty and deprivation) within which <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> occurred. An important contribution of this study was the acknowledgement that change occurred {{as a result of the}} abuse. Women named <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> abuse, questioned a husband's violence against his wife, and made connections between <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> and those <b>of</b> other women, thereby shifting toward a gendered consciousness...|$|R

25|$|The Coimbra bloc was {{not opposed}} to {{lowering}} the age of majority for the emperor but they demanded that any change should be made through legal means i.e. a constitutional amendment. After <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures – from both the Conservative and Liberal Parties – who had arisen during the 1830s became wary of taking on {{a greater role in}} ruling the nation. They looked to the Emperor as providing a fundamental and useful source of authority essential both for governing and for national survival. It was an ironic turn: the same politicians who opposed Pedro I for being a central figure in politics were now trying to put his son in that same position. Unlike the conservatives, however, the liberals were less scrupulous and with popular support and after pressuring the regent to accept the loss of his position declared Pedro II of age on 23 July 1840.|$|E
25|$|Because of <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> {{handling}} boats, the keelmen {{were considered}} useful {{in times of}} war when the Royal Navy required seamen for its warships. During the French wars of the late eighteenth century, the Naval Impress Service would have liked to impress as many keelmen as possible, but the keelmen were officially protected from impressment. However, in 1803, during a time of crisis, the Tyne Regulating Officer captured 53 keelmen with the intention of impressing them into the navy despite their exemption. In retaliation, their wives took up whatever was handy (shovels, pans, rolling pins) and marched to North Shields intent on using any means to rescue their men, whilst the rest of the keelmen went on strike until the captured men were released. A compromise was reached so that 80 ‘volunteers’ (one in ten keelmen) would be accepted into the navy and the rest would be exempted from impressment. A levy was to be paid by the coal-owners and keelmen to provide a bounty for the keelmen who joined the navy. A similar situation existed on the Wear, except that the keelmen there were treated less generously. They had to provide a similar quota of recruits with two landsmen counting as one prime sailor.|$|E
500|$|As feminist {{literary}} critic Susan Gubar argues, Mary Shelley's drama {{is part of}} a female literary tradition, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, H.D., Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, and Doris Lessing, which has responded to the story of Ceres and Proserpine. These writers use the myth as a [...] "way of dealing with <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood....they use the myth of Demeter and Persephone to re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself." [...] Poets such as Dorothy Wellesley, Rachel Annand Taylor, Babette Deutsch, and Helen Wolfert as well as Mary Shelley portray the procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge [...] "the divisions between self and other" [...] that rest at the centre of patriarchy. Feminist poet Adrienne Rich writes that [...] "the loss of the daughter to the mother, the mother to the daughter, is the essential female tragedy", and it is this tragedy that Mary Shelley discusses in her play.|$|E

Craven's assistant Julie Plec had requested input on composers who were [...] "new", [...] "fresh", and [...] "wonderful", and was given Beltrami's name by several people.

Craven, impressed by what he heard, requested Beltrami come to the set to view the opening thirteen minutes of the film containing the introduction {{and the death of}} Barrymore's character. Beltrami was tasked with scoring a piece of music for this scene, which would be reviewed by the producers and the Weinstein brothers. Beltrami was hired to score the entire film {{on the basis of this}} sample. [...] Beltrami had no prior experience scoring a work of horror. Craven and editor Patrick Lussier advised him on how to deliver music that would raise the tension and how to use stings to punctuate the more intense moments. Craven wanted the music to intentionally raise tension during scenes where audience expectations were already raised by <b>their</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> previous horror films. The volume would be raised to indicate that the killer is hiding behind a door, but nothing would be present upon its opening.|$|E

They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. In sharp contrast those of the previous era, the young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation.
