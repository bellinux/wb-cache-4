5|$|Bradford City {{have spent}} two {{seasons in the}} Premier League. In 1999–2000, they avoided relegation with just 36 points, then a record low <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>up,</b> after {{defeating}} Liverpool 1–0 in the final game with a headed goal from David Wetherall. The club have won promotion {{in a total of}} eight seasons and been relegated on ten occasions; three relegations in the previous seven seasons meant the 2007–08 season was their first in the fourth tier in 26 years. Bradford City have also played in European competition when they took one of England's two places in the Intertoto Cup in 2000. They defeated FK Atlantas and RKC Waalwijk before being knocked out by FC Zenit Saint Petersburg in the semi-finals.|$|E

Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E

Marco Schällibaum took over as manager and brought in reinforcements, which had a positive impact and enabled the club <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>up.</b> On 17 December 1999, the BSC Young Boys AG was established with capital of CHF 500,000 (~€320,000).

Everton made a poor start to the 1994–95 season and were bottom of the league after 14 games, having won just once (and even then not until their 13th match); Walker was sacked in November 1994.|$|E
