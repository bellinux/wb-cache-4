5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. <b>The</b> <b>bombs,</b> which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of <b>the</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 22, the French arrested Long in {{the coastal}} town of Phan Thiết, some 160 {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} Saigon. His activities and proclamations had attracted the attention of French colonial officials, and just days before, the Resident of Kampot visited the Battambang temple and spotted the collection of white robes, which were similarly styled to the uniforms worn during the 1909 uprising. However, Long's disciples were unaware that he had been arrested and continued with their plot. After nightfall on March 23, <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> were taken into Saigon and placed at strategic points, with proclamation notices being erected in close proximity. None of <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> successfully detonated. One source says that <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> failed because the French authorities had defused all of them after uncovering the conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself.

The process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted.

5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} {{hijacking}} of an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs, {{which had been}} taken by SPECTRE.

The pair suspect a rich playboy, Emilio Largo, and search the area around his yacht and then the area where they think the yacht may have travelled. After finding the plane—but without the nuclear devices on board—the two agents arrange for Largo's yacht to be tracked and ambushed once <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> are being moved by Largo.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> was {{designed}} for aerial bombardment and maximum efficiency after being dropped. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> had a very thin metal sheet as its only cover, as little as 1/32 in. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> is approximately 8 in in diameter, with a nose {{the shape of a}} hemisphere. <b>The</b> M108 <b>bomb</b> fuse at <b>the</b> nose of <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> detonated <b>the</b> weapon, allowing for the release of the contents inside. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> is designed to carry either white phosphorus (WP) or a mustard agent (H). However, <b>the</b> H <b>bomb</b> filler was found to leak from <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> when loaded, and the M47 and its variant M47A1 were not allowed to be loaded. This was due to the thin steel walls on the weapon. In storage and handling, both corrosion and rough handling were found to cause <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> to leak. When <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> is loaded with the chemical filler H, it weighs approximately 93 lb, 73 lb of which are from H.|$|R
5000|$|Different reports gave {{different}} {{accounts of}} <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> These included {{reports of a}} double-car bomb, truck bomb, suicide bomber and a combined gunman-suicide attack. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> ignited a large fire, which spread throughout the hotel.

5|$|On 4 April 1945, 24 B-17s {{attacked}} fortified {{targets in}} Hamburg.

Immediately, the party stopped and everyone was alarmed. A bomb disposal unit was called by the American forces to check <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> and found out that it was live. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> squad unit successfully removed <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> and finally <b>the</b> house was out of danger.|$|R
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E

The FBI determined it would take 4 men to move it {{and there was no}} way to know if <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> was truly disarmed or safe to move. The FBI decided that <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> would have to be disarmed in the hotel. All guests and their belongings were evacuated from the hotel and the gas main was shut off.|$|R
5000|$|The range tables {{specified}} {{the barrel}} angle and propellant charges required. The additional cordite propelling charge bags were dropped {{down the barrel}} if necessary, or necessary number of propellant charges removed from <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bomb's</b> fuze was set. The gunners stood back, <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> was dropped down the barrel, the detonator {{in the base of}} the [...]303 cartridge in the base of <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> struck a pin {{in the bottom of the}} barrel and fired, igniting the guncotton charges in the base of <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> which in turn ignited the cordite charges if present.
