5|$|The zenith of B-52 {{attacks in}} Vietnam was Operation Linebacker II (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Christmas Bombing), conducted from 18 to 29 December 1972, which consisted of waves of B-52s (mostly D models, but some Gs without jamming equipment and with a smaller bomb load). Over 12 days, B-52s flew 729 sorties and dropped 15,237tons of bombs on Hanoi, Haiphong, and other targets. Originally 42 B-52s were committed to the war; however, numbers were frequently <b>twice</b> <b>this</b> figure. During Operation Linebacker II, fifteen B-52s were shot down, five were heavily damaged (one crashed in Laos), and five suffered medium damage. A total of 25 crew men were killed in these losses. North Vietnam claimed 34 B-52s were shot down.|$|E

5|$|As the CPL playoffs {{began on}} February 5, a February 21 {{championship}} game clash between Okafor and Alexander was pondered {{in the local}} press after the 32-team brackets were announced. The CPL playoffs began with victories over Perspectives Charter by 71–37 and North Lawndale Charter High School 75–63. Against North Lawndale, Alexander had 27 points, 15 rebounds and 5 blocks. On February 16, Curie defeated Simeon 71–64. Alexander had 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 blocks earning a February 19 CPL semifinals rematch against Hyde Park Academy High School who they have already beaten <b>twice</b> <b>this</b> season. Alexander and Curie won 58–56 to reach the anticipated city championship matchup with Young and Okafor at the Jones Convocation Center. Alexander had a triple double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 blocks. The matchup was the most anticipated city championship game since at least 1998 when fellow McDonald's All-Americans Quentin Richardson of Young and Corey Maggette of Fenwick High School were both top 15 players. On February 20, Alexander improved his first place total in the Mr. Basketball USA Tracker, holding eight first place and two second place votes. Curie won the city championship 69–66 in quadruple overtime as Alexander had 20 points, 14 rebounds and 4 blocks according to Chicago Tribune and Comcast SportsNet, while the Chicago Sun-Times and Sports Illustrated credited him with just 12 rebounds. This came against Okafor who had 16 points and 9, 8 or 4 rebounds before fouling out with 2:13 remaining in regulation depending on which of the three sources you believe. The CPL Championship game was attended by Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and was the lead story on the late edition of SportsCenter. Seven days later, Curie was forced to forfeit all of its wins and the CPL championship due to the academic ineligibility of seven of its players. The title will remain vacant.|$|E

25|$|In Ward 12, the city's website {{initially}} named John Caruso as {{the winner}} with 1,798 votes, to challenger Joscelyne Landry-Altmann's 1,756.

25|$|The Eastern Østfold Line {{opened in}} 1882, with the Skotbu {{population}} {{forced to use}} either Kråkstad Station or Tomter Station. A station at Skotbu was permitted built by the Norwegian State Railways after the local population had offered to finance the stop. Originally named Skodbo, the station opened on 1 March 1908. It lacked a passing loop and was only manned to handle passengers and cargo. The station had 1,382 boarding passengers, not including month pass holders, in 1910. This increased to 3,404 five years later. The numbers were nearly <b>twice</b> <b>this</b> during the 1920s, with 7,377 in 1925, but then fell to 5,869 in 1928.|$|E

25|$|Private {{vehicles}} {{are the main}} form of transportation within Auckland, with around 7 per cent of journeys in the Auckland region undertaken by bus in 2006, and 2 per cent undertaken by train and ferry. For trips to the city centre at peak times {{the use of public}} transport is much higher, with more than half of trips undertaken by bus, train or ferry. Auckland still ranks quite low in its use of public transport, having only 46 public transport trips per capita per year, while Wellington has almost <b>twice</b> <b>this</b> number at 91, and Sydney has 114 trips. This strong roading focus results in substantial traffic congestion during peak times.|$|E
25|$|Skeletal muscle burns 90mg (0.5 mmol) of glucose each minute during {{continuous}} activity (such as when repetitively {{extending the}} human knee), generating ≈24 W of mechanical energy, and since muscle energy conversion is only 22–26% efficient, ≈76 W of heat energy. Resting skeletal muscle has a {{basal metabolic rate}} (resting energy consumption) of 0.63 W/kg making a 160 fold difference between the energy consumption of inactive and active muscles. For short duration muscular exertion, energy expenditure can be far greater: an adult human male when jumping up from a squat can mechanically generate 314 W/kg. Such rapid movement can generate <b>twice</b> <b>this</b> amount in nonhuman animals such as bonobos, and in some small lizards.|$|E
25|$|On January 19, 2008, Jones faced former 147 and 154 pound five-time world {{champion}} Félix Trinidad at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The bout was fought at a catchweight of 170lbs. Jones had a noticeable size and speed advantage, and in round seven, a short {{right hand to}} the temple dropped Trinidad to his knees. Jones fired a combination in the tenth round to send Trinidad down once more. Jones won the fight by scores of 117–109 and 116–110 (<b>twice).</b> <b>This</b> {{was the first time}} a former Heavyweight Champion returned to fight successfully at 170lbs.

25|$|The Dowker {{notation}}, {{also called}} the Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation or code, for a knot is a finite sequence of even integers. The numbers are generated by following the knot and marking the crossings with consecutive integers. Since each crossing is visited <b>twice,</b> <b>this</b> creates a pairing of even integers with odd integers. An appropriate sign is given to indicate over and undercrossing. For example, in this figure the knot diagram has crossings labelled with the pairs (1,6) (3,12) (5,2) (7,8) (9,4) and (11,10). The Dowker notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6 12 2 8 4 10. A knot diagram {{has more than one}} possible Dowker notation, and there is a well-understood ambiguity when reconstructing a knot from a Dowker notation.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1955, {{the state}} doubled tolls to $1.80 round trip for cars and $4.00 {{or more for}} trucks {{in order to pay}} for repairs, new toll booths, and a new punched card system {{compatible}} with the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. The toll plazas, which had numbered three - one for each bridge - were consolidated to two, one {{at the south end of}} the main bridge and one at the north end of the Nansemond River Bridge. Thus the Crittenden Bridge became free for local traffic. In addition, passenger vehicles and light trucks only had to pay at the first booth they reached; large trucks and buses had to pay <b>twice.</b> <b>This</b> meant that light vehicles crossing only the main bridge (for instance between Smithfield and Newport News) only had to pay southbound.|$|E
