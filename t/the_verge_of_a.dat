5|$|Elizabeth's {{plan to have}} Mary {{married to}} Louis of France divided the court. The Lackfis, {{the master of the}} {{treasury}} Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August, which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and replacing them with Garai's partisans. The kingdom was on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil war when Charles decided to invade, encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul, Bishop of Zagreb. Charles' imminent arrival forced Elizabeth to yield and abandon the idea of French marriage. While her envoys in Paris were preparing for Louis's journey, Elizabeth came to terms with her opponents and designated Szécsi as the new palatine.|$|E
5|$|As Rafael moved northward, it {{continued}} to intensify rapidly in spite of moderate wind shear. An eye became visible on microwave imagery during the morning hours of October16, during which time the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 969mb (hPa; 28.61inHg). By the afternoon hours of that same day, data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicated that Rafael was on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weakening trend, attributed to decreasing sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear. Though the system retained hurricane-force winds, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone on October17, a process it completed by 1800UTC that same day after interacting with a cold front; {{at the time of}} the transition, Rafael was positioned well southwest of Nova Scotia. The remnants of the cyclone looped around a larger extratropical low, over the north-central Atlantic Ocean for several days, before resuming its eastward motion. The extratropical remnant of Rafael later made landfall on Portugal and dissipated by 1800UTC on October26.|$|E
5|$|In April 1925, Sunderland {{completed}} {{the signing of}} centre forward Dave Halliday, after Buchan left for Arsenal. In his second season Halliday scored 38 goals, helping Sunderland secure a third-place finish in the League. In the 1928–29 season Halliday scored 43goals, a club record for the most individual goals in a season. Kyle, who had been Sunderland's manager since 1905, resigned {{at the end of}} the 1928–29 season, after 25seasons in charge of the club, managing 817matches and taking Sunderland to <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> League and cup double. He was replaced by Johnny Cochrane, who arrived from St Mirren. With Cochrane in charge, Sunderland reached the 1930–31 FA Cup semi-final, where they lost to Birmingham City. Sunderland's next success came in the 1934–35 season when they finished as runners-up to Arsenal. The following season Sunderland managed to win their sixth League title, by a margin of eight points. They scored 109goals during the season, with Raich Carter and Bobby Gurney each scoring 31.|$|E

50|$|By 1972 however, musical tastes had changed. Acoustic rock (with folk-rock influences) was on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{explosion}} {{fueled by}} {{artists such as}} León Gieco, and a heavier rock had become dominant. Blues-rock fell out of favor, and Manal couldn't make the transition. Their third album in 1972 was poorly received, leading to the break-up of the band that same year. Pappo, who was more at ease courting heavy metal audiences, would become the godfather <b>of</b> Argentine blues, <b>a</b> role he kept for over thirty years.|$|R
50|$|Charles I was {{not well}} {{received}} in Castile.

The Castilian nobility and the cities were on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> uprising to defend their rights. Many Castilians favoured the king's younger brother Ferdinand, who grew up in Castile, and in fact the Council of Castile opposed the idea of Charles as King of Castile.|$|R
