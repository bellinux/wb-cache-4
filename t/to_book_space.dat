40|$|As {{part of the}} European Capital of Culture 2005 {{celebrations}} for Cork, {{the exhibition}} (budget £ 350, 000) showcased work of Cork’s silversmiths and goldsmiths over four centuries. It contained over 165 pieces some of which came from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Breaking the rules of conventional exhibition methods for silver and gold, the showcase materials, artefact organisation and lighting were reanalysed {{as a part of}} the design process. The cabinets, 47 in total and varied in size and shape, were all free-standing, to allow for the mobility requested in the brief. They were constructed from untreated Corten steel to amplify the spectacle of the objects, by providing them with a contemporary counterpoint. Traditionally blue-toned light is used to display silver but, with the development and availability of new lighting, the opportunity to innovate resulted in the use of white light, a first in the displaying of precious metals. Fluorescent tubes (with colour designation ‘white light’ and a correlated colour temperature of 4000 Kelvin) combined with PMMA fibre optics tailed from a halogen light generator (white light - 4200 Kelvin) were combined within the cabinets behind a pearl acrylic to generate a ‘pure white’ environment for the silver and gold to be viewed. Received the highest number of visitors to the Crawford Gallery for any single exhibition. Moved to the Hunt Museum, Limerick, Ireland in April 2007.

40|$|BookThe idea of ‘flirting’ {{with space}} is central <b>to</b> this <b>book.</b> <b>Space</b> is {{conceptualized}} {{as being in}} constant flux as we make our way through contexts in our daily lives, considered in relation to encounters with complexities and flows of materiality. Through considerations of dynamic processes of contemporary life-spaces, the book engages the inter-relations of space and journeys, and how creativity happens in those inter-relations. Unravelled through wide-ranging investigations, this book builds new critical syntheses of the intertwining of space and life: the mundane and exotic, ‘lay’ and ‘artistic’. The book creates a fascinating and original view of our interaction with space...|$|R

Therefore, this project report also details the related processes: microphone selection and placement, editing, compression, use of reverb and delay, as well as basic mix techniques and "synthestration" - writing for and mixing virtual instruments.

50|$|The Union Philosophical Society was {{permitted}} to meet in Professor of History, Robert Davidson's recitation room in Denny Hall. During the 1904 fire of Denny Hall, many early records of the society were destroyed. In 1791, the Union Philosophical Society began to gather a collection of books. As the collection grew, the Union Philosophical Society, {{as well as the}} Belles Lettres Society were granted a small space {{on the third floor of}} West College to use as a library. As both societies continued <b>to</b> collect <b>books,</b> the <b>space</b> was soon overcrowded. In 1886, the Bosler Memorial Hall was completed and the collections of both literary societies, along with the collections of the college were kept in the new library, Bosler. These collections were absorbed by the greater Dickinson library, now Waidner-Spahr Library. While the Belles Lettres library room was entirely destroyed in a 1984 renovation of Denny, the UPS library room now stands as Denny 317 (also called the Temple of Minerva). The room is framed with stained glass windows that prominently display the UPS crest as well as commemorate the fire that destroyed Denny Hall.|$|R
