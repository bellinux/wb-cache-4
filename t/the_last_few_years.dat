5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Georgia family, Chivers became {{interested}} in poetry at a young age.

5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Most {{of these findings}} have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E

A biography by Michał Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him {{as a symbol of}} patriotism, and a reminder of military successes.
