2500|$|Predating {{the modern}} age of pornography, facials were {{described}} in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing facials in his work The 120 Days of Sodom, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads [...] "... I show them my prick, <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> suppose I do? I squirt the fuck in their face... That's my passion my child, I have no other... and you're about to behold it." ...|$|E
6000|$|GEORGE. <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> talk about--your minds? [CLARE {{looks at}} him] Will you answer a {{straight}} question? Is he {{falling in love}} with you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think that}} they meant?" [...] cried De Catinat impatiently. [...] "For heaven's sake, let us come to some conclusion, for every minute is of importance." ...|$|E
60|$|She sat up, and her intense relief {{almost made}} itself {{perceptible}} like a fresh {{atmosphere in the}} room. 'Yes. <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come for?' she asked calmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>then?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> then?" [...] {{demanded the}} stranger, rising {{from his seat}} with sudden energy, his voice deep, insistent, masterful. [...] "Tell me what you did?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{undoubtedly}} {{you were}} right; {{it must have}} been gratification; it could not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger with such a question as that. <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> reckon she did? Why, {{she turned}} on that smirking Spanish fool like a wildcat, and out with a 'navy' and shot him dead in open court!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All {{these things}} I know, I know. [...] And that's why {{my heart is}} breaking!' [...] <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> gain by pretending so? [...] 'The joy of an old wound waking.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{can manage}} that, sooner or later. The main thing is, we must watch our chances and strike {{as soon as}} the right moment arrives. Now <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say, Shepley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come riding {{over here}} for, <b>then?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> take all this risk for? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> rush {{over here to}} share my disgrace--for YOU are as much mixed up with this now as I am--if you didn't {{calculate}} to share EVERYTHING ELSE with me? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come here for, then, if not for ME?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I little {{know how}} you got into this fix, but I mean to find out," [...] said Marilla. [...] "Come {{right down to the}} kitchen--it's too cold up here--and tell me just <b>what</b> you've <b>done.</b> I've been expecting {{something}} queer for some time. You haven't got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due. Now, <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to your hair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrade Jarvis," [...] he said, [...] "I {{fear that}} as a smoking-concert {{this is not going}} to be a success. I understand, however. Comrade Repetto and his colleagues have come here on business, and nothing will make them forget it. Typical New York men of affairs, they close their minds to all {{influences}} that might lure them from their business. Let us get on, <b>then.</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> wish to see me about, Comrade Repetto?" ...|$|R
6000|$|JOHNNY. [...] | [...] <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean {{by saying}} that-- [...] | HYPATIA. [...] | [...] Do {{you mean to}} say that I-- [...] | BENTLEY. [...] | [...] Oh, you are a rotter. Youre afraid-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expressed}} to you my conviction {{a little way}} back that it was doubtful whether poor Lady Janet would be much longer competent to manage her own affairs. Perhaps you thought me hasty <b>then?</b> <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither {{did your}} father, {{or he would}} not have been so foolish as to sell {{everything}} he had for money. By the way, it's lucky for you he did not sell this bedstead. Now, <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> forgotten, <b>then?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{expect to}} find? I know {{what sort of}} girl I am; but all the same I am not the sort that men turn their backs on--and {{you ought to know}} it, unless you aren't made like the others. Oh, forgive me! You aren't like the others; you are like no one in the world I ever spoke to. Don't you care for me? Don't you see--?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE FLOWER GIRL [far from reassured] <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{take down}} my words for? How do I {{know whether you}} took me down right? You just show me what you've wrote about me. [The note taker opens his book and holds it {{steadily}} under her nose, though {{the pressure of the}} mob trying to read it over his shoulders would upset a weaker man]. What's that? That ain't proper writing. I can't read that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> Edie, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think of}} a neat cottage and a garden, and a daily dole, and {{nothing to do but}} to dig a little in your garden when you pleased yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want?" [...] {{its owner}} said sharply, {{as she opened}} the door in reply to his knock. [...] "There's nothing for you here. You can look round if you like. It's been all {{stripped}} clean days ago, so I tell you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think St. Nicholas did? In {{his hand}} {{he held a}} little plug of wood, and no sooner had Ill-Luck entered the nut than he stuck the plug in the hole, and there was man's enemy as tight as fly in a bottle.|$|E
60|$|By and by Johnny Chuck {{really did}} find some clover--just the sweetest clover that {{grew in the}} Green Meadows. Johnny Chuck ate and ate and ate and <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think he did? Why, he curled right up in the nice sweet clover and went fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> Soundings, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think of}} the third ship in the French line?" [...] {{continued}} Bury, disregarding the levity of the youth: [...] "did you ever see such top-masts, as she carries, before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well <b>then,</b> girls, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say to {{a stroll}} around the village?" [...] asked their uncle. [...] "I'm told it's a proper place to buy silk {{stockings}} and inlaid wood-work. They come assorted, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man, of course. Very good. Because {{you are a}} man, you may court contamination. Because I am a woman, I may not. Contamination contaminates, <b>does</b> it not? <b>Then</b> <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{here with}} me? Out upon you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Reddy went. There {{was nothing}} else to do. He didn't dare disobey. Granny watched until Reddy had readied his hiding-place. <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think she did?

6000|$|... â€œAnd <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think? That Stafford {{begins to}} tear his hair. Just so. Tugs {{at it with}} both hands without saying anything. Cloete gives a push to the table which nearly sends the fellow off his chair, {{tumbling}} inside the fender; so that {{he has got to}} catch hold of it to save himself. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "That won't do any good," [...] was the reply. [...] "We rooks {{have decided}} the matter already. We mean {{to rule the}} forest, after this, and if any one, {{or all of the}} birds, dare to oppose us, we'll fight until we force them to serve us.

60|$|BRASSBOUND. In Heaven's name <b>then,</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> like! Only don't worry me with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} Maria and myself. But never mind that.

60|$|I <b>then</b> pinted majestickly--to <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think?--to my PLUSH TITES! those sellabrated inigspressables {{which have}} {{rendered}} me famous in Yourope.|$|R
6000|$|... "You crooked cur! But you're only my half-brother, after all. I {{always knew}} you'd come to {{something}} bad, but I never thought you'd disgrace the Naabs and break your father's heart. Now <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want here? Be quick. This's our range {{and you and}} your boss can't ride here. You can't even water your horses. Out with it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's Dunsey, <b>then?</b> <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> stand talking there for? Go and fetch Dunsey, as I tell you, {{and let him}} give {{account of}} what he wanted the money for, and what he's done with it. He shall repent it. I'll turn him out.

6000|$|Most unwisely (seeing {{that he had}} to {{deal with}} a clever child, and that child a girl), Mr. Sarrazin tried flat denial as {{a way out of the}} difficulty. He said: [...] "I don't know why she has gone away." [...] The next {{question}} followed instantly: [...] "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think about it?" [...] In sheer despair, the persecuted friend said the first thing that came into his head.|$|E
60|$|Florentia. <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> fault <b>do</b> <b>you</b> find? Dorriforth. Simply this--that {{the whole}} is a {{pictorial}} whole, not a dramatic one.

6000|$|LADY UTTERWORD [not {{interested}} in Ellie]. When <b>you</b> saw me <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean {{by saying that}} you thought, and <b>then</b> stopping short? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> think? ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Bedad I am, {{said the}} little old man. I have two {{bouncing}} grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now, <b>then!</b> <b>What</b> age <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds. That was {{before you were}} born.|$|R
