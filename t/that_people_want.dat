5|$|Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a {{link between}} letter names and {{donations}} has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, Rita and Mitch). They {{found that people who}} shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.|$|E

25|$|In Marx's {{critique}} of political economy, any labor-product has a value and a use value, {{and if it}} is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a general utility, implied by the fact <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.|$|E
25|$|Many {{web sites}} {{benefit from a}} network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges. For example, eBay {{would not be a}} {{particularly}} useful site if auctions were not competitive. However, as the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more things being sold <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>want.</b> Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.|$|E
25|$|New {{forms of}} New Media are {{emerging}} like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with {{video games and}} the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube {{for the world to}} see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.|$|E

The defeat led {{to the end of}} Specter's nearly 30-year Senate career, the longest of any Pennsylvania Senator in history. Afterward, Sestak declared, [...] "This is what democracy should look like: a win for the people over the establishment.

[...] Specter conceded defeat and said, [...] "It's been a great privilege to serve the people of Pennsylvania. It's been a great privilege to be in the United States Senate." [...] Commentators suggested Specter's defeat signaled an electorate unsatisfied with the establishment in both major parties, and indicated that the backing of prominent politicians had little effect on voters during this political age. Sestak's victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for Obama, who strongly and publicly advocated for Specter during the race. Several news outlets reflected that Sestak's television advertisements condemning Specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been the primary factor in his victory. The Washington Post said the Pennsylvania race drew more attention than any other primary election in 2010 due to Specter's longevity and his switch to the Democratic party.|$|E

[...] Sarah Rodman of the Boston Herald remarked: [...] "For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child." [...] Music critic Gene Stout commented she [...] "has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves." [...] 'N Sync and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance.

Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: [...] "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style." [...] Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated [...] "scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson" [...] who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as [...] "Janet-come-lately's." [...] Other artists who have drawn comparison to her include Mýa, Brandy, Tatyana Ali, Christina Milian, Lady Gaga, Namie Amuro, and BoA.

[...] Joan Morgan of Essence magazine remarked: [...] "Jackson's Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted.
