The friendly feeling which has been expressed toward me in the vote upon the resolution you have just rejected is all that reconciles me to its defeat. Its adoption might have spared me a duty which I find painful. But perhaps it is best that I should discharge it. As to the sermon which called forth that resolution it is only just to say that I intended no personalities in it, and I humbly entreat any one who felt himself aggrieved to believe me." [...] Every one looked at Gerrish to see how he took this; he must have felt it the part of self-respect not to change countenance. [...] "My desire in that discourse was, as always, to present the truth as I had seen it, and try to make it a help to all. But I am by no means sure that the author of the resolution was wrong in arraigning me before you for neglecting a very vital part of Christianity in my ministrations here. I think with him, that those who have made an open profession of Christ have a claim to the consolation of His promises, and to the support which good men have found in the mysteries of faith; and I ask his patience and that of others who feel that I have not laid sufficient stress upon these. My shortcoming is something that I would not have you overlook in any survey of my ministry among you; and I am not here now to defend that ministry in any point of view. As I look back over it, {{by the light of the}} one ineffable ideal, it seems only a record of failure and defeat." [...] He stopped, and a sympathetic dissent ran through the meeting. [...] "There have been times when I was ready to think that the fault was not in me, but in my office, in the church, in religion. We all have these moments of clouded vision, in which we ourselves loom up in illusory grandeur above the work we have failed to do. But it is in no such error that I stand before you now. Day after day it has been borne in upon me that I had mistaken my work here, and that I ought, if there was any truth in me, to turn from it for reasons which I will give at length should I be spared to preach in this place next Sabbath. I should have willingly acquiesced if our parting had come in the form of my dismissal at your hands. Yet I cannot wholly regret that it has not taken that form, and that in offering my resignation, as I shall formally do to <b>those</b> <b>empowered</b> by the rules of our society to receive it, I can make it a means of restoring concord among you. It would be affectation in me to pretend that I did not know of the dissension which has had my ministry for its object if not its cause; and I earnestly hope that with my withdrawal that dissension may cease, and that this church may become a symbol before the world of the peace of Christ. I conjure such of my friends as have been active in my behalf to unite with their brethren in a cause which can alone merit their devotion. Above all things I beseech you to be at peace one with another. Forbear, forgive, submit, remembering that strife for the better part can only make it the worse, and that for Christians there can be no rivalry but in concession and self-sacrifice." ...|$|E

50|$|By {{letters patent}} dated 17 December 1540 the king erected the abbey of Westminster into an episcopal see, and {{appointed}} Thirlby the first and, as it happened, the last {{bishop of the}} new diocese. He was consecrated on 29 December in St. Saviour's Chapel in the cathedral church of Westminster. Soon afterwards he was appointed by the convocation to revise the translation of the epistles of St. James, St. John, and St. Jude. In January 1540-1 he interceded with the crown for the grant {{of the university of}} the house of Franciscan friars at Cambridge. In 1542 he appears {{as a member of the}} privy council, and was also despatched as ambassador to the emperor in Spain. He returned the same year. In April 1543 he took part in the revision of the ‘Institution of a Christian Man,’ and on 17 June in that year he was one of <b>those</b> <b>empowered</b> to treat with the Scots ambassador concerning the proposed marriage of Prince Edward with Mary Queen of Scots. In May 1545 he was despatched on an embassy to the emperor, Charles V. He attended the diet of Bourbourg, and on 16 January 1546-7 he was one of those who signed a treaty of peace at Utrecht. He was not named an executor by Henry VIII and consequently was excluded from Edward VI's privy council. He remained at the court of the emperor till June 1548, taking leave of Charles V at Augsburg on the 11th. Thirlby took part in the important debates in the House of Lords in December 1548 and January 1548-9 on the subject of the sacrament of the altar and the sacrifice of the mass. He declared that 'he did never allow the doctrine’ laid down in the communion office of the proposed first Book of Common Prayer, stating that he mainly objected to the book as it stood because it abolished the ‘elevation’ and the ‘adoration’. When Somerset expressed to Edward VI some disappointment at Thirlby's attitude, the young king remarked, ‘I expected nothing else but that he, who had been so long time with the emperor, should smell of the Interim’. He voted against the third reading of the act of uniformity on 15 January 1548-9, but enforced its provisions in his diocese after it had been passed. On 12 April 1549 he was in the commission for the suppression of heresy, and on 10 November in that year he was ambassador at Brussels with Sir Philip Hoby and Sir Thomas Cheyne. On 29 March 1550 Thirlby resigned the bishopric of Westminster into the hands of the king, who thereupon dissolved it, and reannexed the county of Middlesex, which had been assigned for its diocese, to the see of London. While bishop of Westminster he is said to have ‘impoverished the church’.|$|E

40|$|T oday’s tumultuous {{economic}} and political conditions require universities to adapt—fast. Leaders must attend to unforeseen crises, events, and opportunities in ways that align with their core missions, promote their universities ’ continued existence, and help achieve disparate goals (Rowley, Lujan, and Dolence 1997). Good planning and good plans involve iteration; simple cause-and-effect thinking is no longer enough. Universities can—and frequently do—suffer when they use linear, mechanistic thinking (Presley and Leslie 1999; Rowley, Lujan, and Dolence 1998). Leaders can make too many erroneous assumptions about the future. And, when users view strategic plans as fixed road maps, they often fail to recognize the faulty assumptions that hinder their success along the way. They generally fail to harness emerging opportunities as well.

40|$|Rethinking {{business}} through reengineering {{is based}} on the assumption that to meet contemporary demands of quality, service, flexibility, and low cost, processes must be kept simple. Examples of simplifying processes are combining several jobs into one, letting workers make decisions, performing the steps in a process in a natural order, and performing work where it makes the most sense. The net result is that work may be shifted across functional boundaries several times to expedite its accomplishment. Traditional inspection and control procedures are often eliminated or deferred until the process is complete, providing further cost savings. The authors, focusing their research on enterprises from Oltenia Region, demonstrate how reengineering can be carried out in a variety of corporate settings. But although workers are the ones who need to be empowered to carry out reengineering, the authors are adamant that the process must start at the top. This is because it involves making major changes that are likely to cut across traditional organizational boundaries. <b>Those</b> <b>empowered</b> to make the changes at lower levels must know they have the support of top management, or change wonï¿½t occur. reengineering, rethinking business processes, regional economy, leadership, organization...|$|E

40|$|In 2010, Celia de Fréine {{published}} the Gaelic translation of “Penelope”, {{a poem by}} the Galician poet Xohana Torres which challenges the passive role ascribed to women by Western literary tradition and claims for the unknown seas as the space into which women must venture. In 2011, De Fréine published a revised version of her previous Gaelic rendering and added an English translation, a signal of her attraction towards the symbolic figuration of this alternative Penelope the navigator. Along a similar line, De Fréine’s 2010 poetry collection imram: odyssey, framed by the Gaelic genre of the imram about the voyage and its challenges, sheds light on women’s long-repressed wanderlust and yearning for adventure.

40|$|In this essay—considering 2 ̆ 2 privacy 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secrecy 2 ̆ 2 in courts—I first offer a {{brief history}} of the public performance, through adjudication, of the power of rulers, who relied on open rituals of {{judgment}} and punishment to make and maintain law and order. Second, I turn to consider why, during the twentieth century, the federal courts became an unusually good source of information about legal, political, and social conflict. Third, I map how, despite new information technologies, knowledge about conflicts and their resolution is being limited by the devolution of court authority to agencies, by the outsourcing of decisions to private providers, and by the internalization in courts of rules that promote private management and settlement of conflicts in lieu of adjudication. Fourth, I argue that deployment of new procedures of dispute resolution requires new answers to questions about what processes should be presumptively public and that, given their political implications, these answers should not be left to judges, as rulemakers or doctrine-producers alone. Fifth, I explain why new regulations are needed to protect the public dimensions of courts and to create public dimensions for their alternatives. Public processes generate not only knowledge about the uses of power but also a commitment to fair treatment by government, to accountability in government, and to norm development, all of which should not be controlled exclusively by the parties to a dispute nor by <b>those</b> <b>empowered</b> to resolve it...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{have long}} sought to {{identify}} manipulable factors distinct from student socioeconomic status and race-ethnicity that might increase overall student achievement or reduce differences in achievement between white and non-white students who attend the same school. Numerous quantitative research syntheses that researchers {{mounted in the}} 19802 ̆ 7 s generally uncovered few factors. In recent years, however, researchers have applied different synthesis methods to old data. Some of these analyses have produced evidence of several statistically significant relationships between factors such as class size and achievement. Nevertheless, this evidence is unconvincing for numerous reasons, creating a need for additional research with new data. In this study, I investigate the relationship among several school policies, practices and resources, the reading achievement of fourth-grade students, and differences in reading achievement between white and non-white fourth-grade students who attend the same school by applying a series of multilevel statistical models to data from the 1994 National (NAEP) and Trial State Assessments (TSA) of Educational Progress. Analyses of Pennsylvania data indicate that per-pupil spending, school racial composition, and an interaction between class size and teacher experience are associated with reading proficiency. Analyses of New York data indicate that per-pupil spending, school racial composition, and teacher experience are associated with reading proficiency while teacher certification level is associated with differences in reading proficiency between white and non-white students who attend the same school. Finally, analyses of United States data indicate that school racial composition is associated with reading proficiency while teacher certification level and school location are associated with differences in reading proficiency between white and non-white students who attend the same school. The evidence produced here provides new, potentially useful information to policy makers at national, state, district, and school levels.
