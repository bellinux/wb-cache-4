5|$|On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one {{of their}} own until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro {{requests}} that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.|$|E

However, this {{operation}} ends in a disaster as Rintarō ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake. After this failure, Rintarō receives a message from his future self, telling him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1.048596%, which he dubs the 'Steins Gate'. Returning to the past again, Rintarō puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu's life, prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory, and fool his past self, setting him on his journey through time. Returning to the Steins Gate world line, safe from the threat of a third world war, Rintarō and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance (or by fate) in the streets of Akihabara.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{organization}} {{and efficiency of}} early law enforcement was often a source of public controversy. Because of this, a parliamentary committee was appointed to investigate {{the current system of}} policing. Upon Sir Robert Peel being appointed as Home Secretary in 1822, he established a second and more effective committee, and acted upon its findings. Robert Peel, believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> standardise the police was to make it an official paid profession, to organise it in a civilian fashion, and to make it answerable to the public. After he presented his ideas to Parliament, they were approved and made official with the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{an earlier}} {{generation}} of Germans had found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> defeat the supposedly impregnable Maginot Line {{was simply to}} go around one end of it, so too {{hundreds of thousands of}} East Germans found an escape route across the border of East Germany's erstwhile ally, Hungary. The inner German border's integrity relied ultimately on other Warsaw Pact states fortifying their own borders and being willing to shoot escapees, including East Germans, around fifty of whom were shot on the borders of Polish People's Republic, Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Hungarian People's Republic, Socialist Republic of Romania and People's Republic of Bulgaria between 1947 and 1989. However, this meant that as soon as one of the other eastern bloc nations relaxed its border controls, the East Germans would be able to exit in large numbers.|$|E
25|$|Hagrid is {{introduced}} in the opening chapter of the first novel. Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house {{after they have been}} murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about {{the fact that it was}} Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher’s Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get past Fluffy is to play music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron’s older brother, Charlie Weasley, works.|$|E

25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> improve recoveries was to use small bubbles {{in the order of}} 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|E
500|$|When she was young, Varian {{developed}} {{an interest in}} finding the [...] "perfect" [...] horse. She soon realized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> achieve her goal was to begin breeding horses. Her first Arabian was the mare Farlotta (Lotnik × Farza), obtained in 1952. Farlotta became a finished spade bit horse who won both stock horse (reining) and western pleasure championships. Although loved and cared for by Varian, the mare had been neglected in her first two years prior to being purchased by Varian, {{and as a result}} of underlying health damage died at the age of seven.|$|E
500|$|One of Vargas Llosa's {{more recent}} novels, The Way to Paradise (El paraíso en la otra esquina), is set largely in France and Tahiti. Based on the {{biography}} of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia. Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> Paradise lacks the [...] "audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius" [...] that was present in his previous works.|$|E

500|$|Verity never {{spun the}} ball very far, {{particularly}} after his second tour to Australia, and preferred {{to concentrate on}} bowling a good length. However, critics {{did not think that}} Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch. By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches, and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness. Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut. Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: [...] "Do not praise me when I have taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when I have got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket." [...] At times, Verity almost seemed bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.|$|E
500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E
