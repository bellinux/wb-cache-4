5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules <b>to</b> <b>couple</b> <b>with</b> the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E

The moths remain in copula for up to an hour, but the {{transfer}} of the spermatophore is usually accomplished within 10 minutes. Male moths can inseminate more than one female. Multiple mating in females is possible, but uncommon, because the female stops releasing the attracting pheromone after mating. After mating, the females begin depositing the eggs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{marriage}} of Samael and Lilith {{is known as}} the [...] "Angel Satan" [...] or the [...] "Other God", but it was not allowed to last. To prevent Lilith and Samael's demonic children Lilin from filling the world, God castrated Samael. In many 17th century Kabbalistic books, this mythologem is based on the identification of [...] "Leviathan the Slant Serpent and Leviathan the Torturous Serpent" [...] and a reinterpretation of an old Talmudic myth where God castrated the male Leviathan and slew the female Leviathan in order to prevent them from mating and thereby destroying the earth. After Samael became castrated and Lilith was unable to fornicate with him, she left him <b>to</b> <b>couple</b> <b>with</b> men who experience nocturnal emissions. A 15th or 16th century Kabbalah text states that God has [...] "cooled" [...] the female Leviathan, meaning that he has made Lilith infertile and she is a mere fornication.|$|E

60|$|If {{the history}} of these Porto Santo rabbits had not been known, most naturalists, on observing their much reduced size, their colour, reddish above and grey beneath, their tails and ears not tipped with black, would have ranked them as a {{distinct}} species. They would have been strongly confirmed in this view by seeing them alive in the Zoological Gardens, and hearing that they refused <b>to</b> <b>couple</b> <b>with</b> other rabbits. Yet this rabbit, which {{there can be little}} doubt would thus have been ranked as a distinct species, as certainly originated since the year 1420. Finally, from the three cases of the rabbits which have run wild in Porto Santo, Jamaica, and the Falkland Islands, we see that these animals do not, under new conditions of life, revert to or retain their aboriginal character, as is so generally asserted to be the case by most authors.|$|E

The beautiful girl herself was unconscious of the attention she excited; but one who knew her secret might easily detect the intense feeling with which she awaited the issue. The opinions of her confessor had seemed so reasonable, that Isabella was {{on the point of}} assenting to the report of the commissioners, and of abandoning altogether the secret hopes and expectations she had begun <b>to</b> <b>couple</b> <b>with</b> the success of the navigator's schemes, when a gentler feeling, one that belonged peculiarly to her own feminine heart, interposed to give the mariner another chance.

6000|$|Such a {{conception}} of women must make [...] "Telemaque," [...] {{to the end of}} time, useless as a wholesome book of education. It must have crippled its influence, especially in France, in its own time. For there, for good and for evil, woman was asserting more and more her power, and her right to power, over the mind and heart of man. Rising from the long degradation of the Middle Ages, which had really respected her only when unsexed and celibate, the French woman had assumed, often lawlessly, always triumphantly, her just freedom; her true place as the equal, the coadjutor, the counsellor of man. Of all problems connected with the education of a young prince, that of the influence of woman was, in the France of the Ancien Regime, the most important. And it was just that which Fenelon did not, perhaps dared not, try to touch; and which he most certainly could not have solved. Meanwhile, not only Madame de Maintenon, but women whose names it were a shame <b>to</b> <b>couple</b> <b>with</b> hers, must have smiled at, while they hated, the saint who attempted to dispense not only with them, but with the ideal queen who should have been the helpmeet of the ideal king.|$|E

40|$|Recently, Cappell and Miller {{extended}} the classical {{construction of the}} analytic torsion for de Rham complexes <b>to</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>with</b> an arbitrary flat bundle and the holomorphic torsion for ∂̅-complexes <b>to</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>with</b> an arbitrary holomorphic bundle with compatible connection of type (1, 1). Cappell and Miller studied the properties of these torsions, including the behavior under metric deformations. On the other hand, Mathai and Wu generalized the classical construction of the analytic torsion to the twisted de Rham complexes with an odd degree closed form as a flux and later, more generally, to the Z_ 2 -graded elliptic complexes. Mathai and Wu also studied the properties of analytic torsions for the Z_ 2 -graded elliptic complexes, including the behavior under metric and flux deformations. In this paper we define the Cappell-Miller holomorphic torsion for the twisted Dolbeault-type complexes and the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion for the twisted de Rham complexes. We obtain variation formulas for the twisted Cappell-Miller holomorphic and analytic torsions under metric and flux deformations. Comment: 21 page...|$|R
