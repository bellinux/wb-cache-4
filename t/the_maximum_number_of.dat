30|$|This {{section is}} devoted to {{investigate}} {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithm to solve medium size 0 – 1 knapsack problems. Ten instances are taken from [42], where sizes of these instances include 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 and 75 items. The information about these instances such as dimension, parameters and optimum solution are listed in Table  3.
