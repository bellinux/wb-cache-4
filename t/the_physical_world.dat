5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} decade {{research}} {{groups as well as}} a number of commercial software developers have started to deploy embodied conversational characters in the user interface especially in those application areas where a close emulation of multimodal human-human communication is needed. Most of these characters have one thing in common: In order to enter <b>the</b> user’s <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> they need to be <b>physical</b> themselves. <b>The</b> paper focuses on challenges that arise when embedding synthetic conversational agents in <b>the</b> user’s <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> We will start from work on synthetic agents that populate virtual worlds and anthropomorphic robots that inhabit <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> and discuss how the two areas need to be combined in order to populate <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> with synthetic characters. Finally, we will report on so-called traversable interfaces that allow agents to cross the border from <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> space to <b>the</b> virtual space and vice versa. ...|$|R
40|$|Until the 20 th-century, {{our society}} was {{structured}} {{in such a}} way that most social activities took place in what you could call the "physical real world. " After the last decade of the 20 th-century, a "cyber network society " began to emerge thanks to the advancement of information and communication technologies (Fig. 1). While <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> real <b>world</b> is governed by physical and chemical laws such as gravity and human biological characteristics, activities in the cyber network society are designed based on “artificial ” standards, regulations, laws, and so on. To design 21 st-century social infrastructures, therefore, it is crucial to study how we can integrate <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> real <b>world</b> and <b>the</b> cyber network society. One idea to realize this cyber-real integration is to link and merge dynamical flows in <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> real <b>world</b> and <b>the</b> cyber network society; the former is characterized by the flows of goods, people, and energy and the latter by the flow o...|$|R
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> (including all the {{fluctuations}} which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} times, {{rather than}} making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his Book of Optics in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed {{to figure out how}} to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.|$|E

5|$|The game's 21skills fall evenly {{under the}} {{categories}} of combat, magic, and stealth, and many skills complement more than one area. Combat skills are used primarily for battle and incorporate armor and heavy weapons like blades, axes, maces, and hammers. Magic skills rely {{on the use of}} spells to alter <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> to affect the minds of others, to injure and debilitate enemies, to summon monsters to help fight, and to heal wounds. Stealth skills allow the player to crack locks, haggle for goods, use speech to manipulate people, and apply cunning in combat (through the use of a bow or with a sneak attack). The spells, weapons, and other tools such that a player needs to employ and enhance these skills, such as lockpicks, can be purchased in shops, stolen from NPCs, or found as loot on the bodies of foes or in dungeons.|$|E

25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> Jackson does not give a {{positive}} justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> but some would ask how we could argue for their existence {{if they did not}} affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E

The proposed “building” becomes the frame of these relationships. The built project is the landscape of connections shaped by its passengers- the networked individual and the incessant flow of information. “Community” has been sentimentalized in our American culture as the suburban “neighborhood”. By contrast I see community as networked individuality, human sociability which takes place at {{the interface}} of <b>the</b> digital and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> and therefore transcends geographical space and time. In effect, community becomes a space of distant intimacy. It is the purpose of this project to materialize this space. Space is what is available; space holds potential.
