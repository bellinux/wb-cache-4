Terisa is a troubled young woman who doubts the reality of her own existence, even before she is summoned <b>to</b> <b>Mordant,</b> where the {{prevailing}} belief among Imagers is that the things they summon from their magic mirrors (such as Terisa) do not actually exist before Imagery brings them into the world of Mordant.|$|E
40|$|Aluminium {{sulphate}} {{was chosen}} as the simplest mordant, and purpurine (1, 2, 4 -hydroxyanthraquinone) as the simplest dye suitable for use in experiments with mordants. It was shown by a series of experiments that a solution containing about 16 atoms of aluminium to each molecule of purpurine has special properties. A section already dyed with an aluminium/purpurine solution till chromatin is dark and cytoplasm lightly tinged, is in equilibrium with such a solution: that is to say, it neither takes up more dye nor loses any part of what it already holds. If the proportion of dye <b>to</b> <b>mordant</b> is increased, the section will take up more of the dye; if the proportion of the mordant to the dye is increased, the section will lose part or all of the dye it held. The experiments described in the paper, taken in conjunction with existing know-ledge of the behaviour of aluminion ions in solution and of their capacity to form chelate compounds with anthraquinonoid dyes, afford a basis for the following theory of single-bath mordant dyeing by aluminium/purpurine. One purpurine ion chelates with one hydrated aluminium ion to form a comple...|$|E
40|$|Michel Garcia’s {{workshop}} The Many Shades of Cochineal Red at the in Arlington Arts Center in Arlington, Virginia, {{was packed}} with multiple steaming pots, a couple of blown fuses and multiple vibrant hues of red, purples and oranges. Garcia demonstrated how the selection of mordanting processes {{used in conjunction with}} cochineal dye resulted in different nuances of the color red in the final dyed cloth and yarn. As a bonus and demonstration of other reds from natural dyes, Garcia also used madder to dye more fiber. The three mordanting methods outlined by Garcia were what he called the classical method, the forgotten method and the unknown method. The classical method uses the mineral salt alum (aluminum sulfate) and cream of tartar <b>to</b> <b>mordant</b> the fiber. The forgotten method uses bio-accumulators of Aluminum in place of mineral salts as a mordant. This method was in use in some countries until the 18 th century. Both the classical and forgotten methods require that the fiber be mordanted separately before being dyed in a cochineal bath. The third or unknown method is a one-bath process using plant tannins and citric acid together with the cochineal all at the same time. The classical mordanting method of mineral alum (15 % weight of fiber/WOF) with an addition of cream of tartar (6 % WOF) simmered and then dyed in the cochineal bath produced a rosy red on wool gauze and cool blue-toned purple-red on felted wool and wool yarn. A bonus dye bath on silk produced a deep rose pink...|$|E

30|$|Newspaper {{advertisements}} refer <b>to</b> <b>mordants</b> such as alum (potassium aluminium sulphate), verdigris (copper acetates), copperas or green/blue vitriol (possibly iron and/or copper sulphate), {{cream of}} tartar (potassium bitartrate, KC 4 H 5 O 6), arsenic, and granulated tin (possibly tin chloride).

30|$|Again, {{ferrous sulfate}} as a {{transition}} metal having coordination number 6 forms {{a large number of}} complexes with the dye molecules (Mongkholrattanasit and Punrattanasin 2012). As a result, when they interact with the silk fiber, some coordination sites remain free, and at that time, amino and carboxylic groups on the fiber can occupy these free sites. Thus, ferrous sulfate can form a ternary complex on one site with the fiber and in another site with the dye (Fig.  4). This strong coordination tendency can enhance interaction between the fiber and the dye (Bhattacharya and Shah 2000). This resulted in higher dye uptake as well as shade change due <b>to</b> <b>mordanting</b> with ferrous sulfate (Uddin 2014).|$|R

30|$|This {{study was}} planned {{in search of}} greener {{alternative}} to satisfy the consumers’ growing demand of eco-friendly products, and {{progress has been made}} with this study in the use of mango leaves extracts. The maximum relative color strength of the extracted dye liquor was found to be at pH 10. But the extracted dye liquors have shown good pH stability in acidic conditions. It was shown that different fashion hues were obtained on silk fabric from the same dye extract using mordants and their combinations. Again, color yields were found to be influenced by the addition of mordants. In single mordanting, the order of color yield was ferrous sulfate[*]>[*]alum[*]>[*]tin. In combined mordanting, the order was ferrous sulfate-alum[*]>[*]alum-tin-tannic acid[*]>[*]ferrous sulfate-alum-tin[*]>[*]alum-tin. Other color values were also found to be influenced due <b>to</b> <b>mordanting.</b> Washing and light fastness properties were found to be from good to excellent in most of the cases.

30|$|In contrast, {{aluminum}} and tin salts formed weak coordination complexes with the dyes.
