60|$|The {{foundation}} of the long and dreadful quarrel between these royal cousins was, as has been already remarked, their consanguinity, which made them both competitors for the same throne; and as that throne was, in some respects, the highest and most powerful in the world, {{it is not surprising}} that two such ambitious women should be eager and persevering in their contest for it. By turning to the genealogical <b>table</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 68, where a view is presented of the royal family of England in the time of Elizabeth, the reader will see once more what was the precise relationship which the two queens bore to each other and to the succession. By this table it is very evident that Elizabeth was the true inheritor of the crown, provided it were admitted that she was the lawful daughter and heir of King Henry the Eighth, and this depended on the question of the validity of her father's marriage with his first wife, Catharine of Aragon; for, as has been before said, he was married to Anne Boleyn before obtaining any thing like a divorce from Catharine; consequently, the marriage with Elizabeth's mother could not be legally valid, unless that with Catharine had been void from the beginning. The friends of Mary Queen of Scots maintained that it was not thus void, and that, consequently, the marriage with Anne Boleyn was null; that Elizabeth, therefore, the descendant of the marriage, was not, legally and technically, a daughter of Henry the Eighth, and, consequently, not entitled to inherit his crown; and that the crown, of right, ought to descend to the next heir, that is, to Mary Queen of Scots herself.|$|E

Published records of ketosis, pneumonia and lameness {{have been found}} less commonly. These diseases have more complex case definitions, and may require more advanced diagnostic tests.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of solving Dirichlet-Neumann problems via the Craig-Sulem (CS) expansion, the Ablowitz-Fokas-Musslimani (AFM) implicit formulation, the dual AFM formulation (AFM*), a boundary integral collocation method (BIM), and the transformed field expansion (TFE) method. The first three methods involve highly ill-conditioned intermediate calculations that we show can be overcome using multiple-precision arithmetic. The latter two methods avoid catastrophic cancellation of digits in intermediate results, and are much better suited to numerical computation. For the Craig-Sulem expansion, we explore the cancellation of terms at each order (up to 150 th) for three types of wave profiles, namely band-limited, real-analytic, or smooth. For the AFM and AFM* methods, we present an example in which representing the Dirichlet or Neumann data as a series using the AFM basis functions is impossible, causing the methods to fail. The example involves band-limited wave profiles of arbitrarily small amplitude, with analytic Dirichlet data. We then show how to regularize the AFM and AFM* methods by over-sampling the basis functions and using the singular value decomposition or QR-factorization to orthogonalize them. Two additional examples are used to compare all five methods {{in the context of}} water waves, namely a large-amplitude standing wave in deep water, and a pair of interacting traveling waves in finite depth.

Does it work, and how good is it? A new Cochrane re-view [1] has pulled together the evidence. Searching Searching was exhaustive. Randomised trials were sought in which nicotine replacement was compared with placebo or no treatment, or studies with different doses of nicotine. Stud-ies had to report cessation rate. Outcomes The outcome was smoking cessation, with at least six months of follow-up. The estimate at 12 months was taken when avail-able, with six months being taken only when 12 -month data were unavailable. The strictest criterion available was used to define abstinence, preference being given to biochemical confirmation of abstinence. Patients lost to follow up were regarded as being continuing smokers.
