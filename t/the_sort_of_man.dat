5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the most}} zealous and untiring fieldsman I ever saw, <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who, if {{standing}} or fretting at deep square-leg, might be relied upon to back up cover-point on an emergency. Who that has experienced it will ever forget the sound, as of a mighty rushing steam-engine behind him, as he went to fetch a fourer when Inglis was on the war-path! His activity in very sooth covered not only much ground, but a multitude of other people's sins.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{engagement}} to Artie, Betty and Joe fall in love. When Norma discovers a manuscript with Joe and Betty's names on it, she telephones Betty and insinuates <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> that Joe really is. Overhearing, Joe invites Betty {{to come see}} for herself. When she arrives, Joe feigns satisfaction with {{his life as a}} kept man, but after Betty tearfully leaves, he packs to return to his old newspaper job. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him. He bluntly informs her that the public has forgotten her, there will be no comeback, and her fan letters are written by Max. As Joe walks away, Norma shoots him three times. He falls into the pool, ending the flashback.|$|E

500|$|Savage {{was hired}} by MSNBC {{president}} Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, [...] "Is this <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who embodies the values of NBC?" [...] Sorenson, at the time, called Savage [...] "brash, passionate and smart," [...] and promised that he would provide [...] "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge." ...|$|E
500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Mantle played Maynard in Ben Bolt's TV movie, Second Nature, which starred Alec Baldwin in {{the leading}} role, and {{appeared}} in the first episode of the series Fortysomething. He portrayed Percy, described as a [...] "big, bashful Northern mill-worker who lives with his mum", in Patrick Sanford's stage production of Rattle of a Simple Man at the Clwyd Theatr Cymru in Mold, Flintshire. Gail Cooper of the Western Mail praised his performance and said: Mantle, better known as dishy and confident consultant Mike Barrett in Casualty, is cast completely against type as Percy, the 42-year-old virgin who admits to being only 35. His body language is superb: awkward, self-effacing, obsessively tidy – Coronation Street fans should think Roy Cropper {{if they want to}} imagine <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> Percy is. In 2003, Mantle began filming The Bingo Club, one of five specially commissioned one-hour plays which were screened in January 2004 on BBC1. Co-starring Paula Wilcox and John McArdle, The Bingo Tales relates the story of three women facing romantic hardship and growing old. During production, Mantle fell on his face while shooting a fencing scene and was rushed to Selly Oak Hospital with a ruptured ligament in his leg.|$|E

Men who will do such deeds as that are not <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> to be paid by money." ...|$|R
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{has what}} scholar Cora Kaplan {{labelled}} in 2002 a [...] "curious" [...] legacy that {{has evolved over}} time: [...] "for an author-activist adept in many genres... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft's life has been read much more closely than her writing". After the devastating effect of Godwin's Memoirs, Wollstonecraft's reputation lay in tatters for a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth, who patterned the [...] "freakish" [...] Harriet Freke in Belinda (1801) after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays, Charlotte Turner Smith, Fanny Burney, and Jane West created similar figures, all to teach a [...] "moral lesson" [...] to their readers. (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.) One writer who never mentioned Wollstonecraft by name, but whose novels often contain allusions to her was Jane Austen. The American scholar Anne Mellor noted as example that the character of Wickham in Pride and Prejudice seems to be based upon <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> that Wollstonecraft claimed that standing armies produce while the sarcastic remarks that Elizabeth Bennet makes about [...] "female accomplishments" [...] in the same novel closely echo Wollstonecraft's condemnation of [...] "female accomplishments" [...] in A Vindication of the Rights of Women; the balance between a woman must strike between feelings and reason in Sense and Sensibility follows what Wollstonecraft had recommended in her novel Mary; the moral equivalence that Austen drew between slavery and the treatment of women in British society in Mansfield Park follows one of Wollstonecraft's favorite arguments; and presentation of Anne Eliot in Persuasion as better qualified to manage her family estate than her father also echoes a thesis of Wollstonecraft.|$|E

"Whenever I've {{seen one}} of those 'Gun-free Zone' signs, {{especially}} outside of a school filled with our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, I've always wondered exactly who these signs are directed at.

2500|$|Hippias of Elis: {{a famous}} sophist, {{originally}} from Elis. Known throughout ancient Greece, he was reputed to have mastered mathematics, astronomy and rhetoric; he boasted {{that he could}} speak on any subject at Olympia without preparation. [...] Plato presents him as setting himself up as an expert on Homeric criticism, and over-reaching his expertise. Hippias is exactly <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> Socrates complains about in the Apology, a man who develops expertise {{in one or more}} areas, and then imagines he knows everything.|$|E

During this aside I sat thinking, and then at his desire I told him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>men.</b> He searched me with questions.

Even as the Red Army battled the Panzers to a standstill on the outskirts of Moscow. At this distance, {{it is hard to imagine}} what a lonely line this was to take.

2500|$|While {{taking an}} {{entrance}} examination, the captain {{who was the}} proctor realized that Vang knew almost no written French. The captain dictated the answers to Vang so he could join the army. Vang insisted the captain gave him the answers but did not actually guide {{his hand on the}} paper. Anne Fadiman, author of The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, said Vang did not express any embarrassment over this cheating. Fadiman added [...] "it is worth noting that in this incident, far from tarnishing Vang Pao's reputation — as, for example Ted Kennedy's fudged Spanish exam at Harvard University tarnished his — merely added to his mythology: this was <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who could never be held back by such petty impediments as rules." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{heroine of}} the story, Lucile, is {{believed}} to have been modelled upon Churchill's mother, Lady Randolph Churchill. Lucile is the wife of the out-of-touch ruler of Laurania, Molara. Lucile abandons Molara for the charms of Savrola, a character more like Churchill himself. One of the characters, Tiro, an officer in the republican guard, discusses his life in conversation with Savrola, mirroring the life of a subaltern officer in the Indian Army which Churchill had experienced. Savrola himself is described as [...] "vehement, high and daring", and <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who could [...] "know rest only in action, contentment only in danger, and in confusion find their only peace... Ambition was the motive force, and he was powerless to resist it". The story contains a nurse, who again has been compared to Churchill's own nurse, Mrs Everest. The book is dedicated to the officers of the 4th Hussars, Churchill's regiment.|$|E
2500|$|The revived {{programme}} establishes that Time Lords invent {{their own}} names. In [...] "The Sound of Drums" [...] (2007), the Tenth Doctor remarks to the Master {{that they both}} chose their names, with the Master calling him sanctimonious for identifying himself as [...] "the man who makes people better." [...] "The Name of the Doctor" [...] and [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] elaborate that the Doctor chose the name as a promise for <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he wants to be: [...] "Never cruel or cowardly. Never giving up and never giving in." [...] By contrast, the Eleventh Doctor spoke of the War Doctor (John Hurt) as being the man who broke that promise, being the one {{to fight in the}} Time War before learning the actual fate of the Time Lords. Since contradicted by the television series, the 2003 Telos novella Frayed by Tara Samms, set prior to the programme's first episode in 1963, presents the alternative explanation that the Doctor was given that name by medical staff on a foreign planet and liked it.|$|E

60|$|The {{spirits of}} the company being {{somewhat}} damped by this embarrassing line of conduct {{on the part of}} their host, nothing more was said for a long time; but at length Mr Cobb took upon himself to remark, as he rose to knock the ashes out of his pipe, that he hoped Joe would thenceforth learn to obey his father in all things; that he had found, that day, he was not one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> who were to be trifled with; and that he would recommend him, poetically speaking, to mind his eye for the future.|$|R

[...] It seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by <b>the</b> right <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man,</b> and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. [...] "Very good, Pip," [...] he observed, when I had concluded, [...] "I'll go round presently, and pay our friend off." [...] Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with.
