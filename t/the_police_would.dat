25|$|<b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> {{start an}} investigation, never {{directed}} at any single individual, following the landslide. It was closed on November 21, 2005, however, because unlawful acts {{would have happened}} too long before the slide. In a press release, the municipality's cabinet leader Monica Mæland apologized for the decision, stating that an investigation would have uncovered {{all sides of the}} case.|$|E

50|$|Thirty-three {{officers}} {{were arrested in}} a wide-ranging investigation of corruption at the 30th Precinct station house up in Harlem. Some of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> officers <b>would</b> illegally search known drug dealers' apartments, seizing drugs and cash. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> officers <b>would</b> then sell the seized drugs {{straight out of the}} 30th Precinct station house itself at half-market price in order to profit from their spoils.|$|R

25|$|In addition, {{the police}} were widely seen as often corrupt and {{involved}} in crimes, and crime rates had been rising since the 1980s. Trust in most police is generally low (particularly in Caracas, with some exceptions for municipal police of wealthier municipalities in Caracas), and only around a third of violent crimes are reported to the police, with half of survey respondents citing a lack of belief that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> do anything.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, 23 September 1957 eight black {{students}} entered Central High. When word spread {{that the students}} were inside a crowd of approximately 1,000 gathered outside the school. There was a concern that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to}} handle the crowd, but tensions eased when the {{black students}} were removed from Central. A force of 150 Guardsmen had been assembled and placed on five-minute notice to assist the police at Central, but they were not called on.|$|E

25|$|The Central Labor Council, the Building Trades Council and the Teamsters Joint Council {{approached}} Mike Johannes, the Minneapolis Chief of Police, {{to propose}} a truce, under which the local would cease picketing for twenty-four hours if {{the police and the}} employers ceased trying to move trucks. The employers, the Teamsters and the building trades signed a formal truce agreement. Johannes, however, declared that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> move trucks once the truce expired, leading the union to announce that it was resuming picketing.|$|E
25|$|In August, 2015, San Francisco Supervisor John Avalos {{announced}} plans to introduce an ordinance that would set a “San Francisco Right-of-Way Policy” that would make citations for bicyclists who safely yield at stop signs the lowest law enforcement priority. Running a stop sign would still be illegal, but <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> be discouraged from enforcing it, making this a proxy for a stop-as-yield law. The bill was passed in an initial vote by the Board of Supervisors on December 16, 2015. However, on January 20, 2016, the Mayor vetoed the bill.|$|E
25|$|After {{the appeal}} {{made to the}} supreme court was {{rejected}} an ultimatum was set for the users of Ungdomshuset. The ultimatum stated that the users had until 14 December 2006 to leave the house. If not <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> be called in to evict the house by force. A peaceful solution to the conflict now seemed to be impossible. The users of Ungdomshuset started to mobilize for a physical defense of the house. In December they called for three days of actions and demonstrations starting on 14 December. These included a demonstration on 16 December.|$|E
50|$|Through his {{position}} in the municipal government he also became, for a brief period, the chairman of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> committee of <b>the</b> city.

25|$|The 1872 work {{stoppage}} {{did not result}} in the formation of police union. Most of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> not have considered forming a union, as they considered the police a quasi-military institution. Despite the tens of men dismissed after the 1872 strike, members of the Metropolitan Force later took action again. In July 1890 they conducted a {{work stoppage}} over low police pensions. The government argued {{that it would not be}} held hostage by their demands, but Parliament passed the Police Pensions Bill (1890) to address inequities, in a matter of weeks.|$|E
25|$|When {{initially}} questioned for {{ten hours}} by the police, Shepherd {{refused to discuss}} Stewart's disappearance. Afterwards, he spoke with an activist named Quanell X, whom officers credit with helping to obtain a confession. Quanell informed Shepherd that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> look for incriminating forensic evidence if he was involved. Shepherd started crying as the two spoke and later led the activist and a detective to a trash can where he stated he left the body. When no {{body was found in}} the trash container, Shepherd confessed to the murder. However, investigators did discover Stewart's teeth in the disposal.|$|E
25|$|The {{house was}} overcrowded, {{and she and}} her husband moved several times, first in December 2003 to Goverton Square, Bulwell, then, after {{complaining}} to the Nottingham City Council that they were still being harassed by their overbearing family, to temporary accommodation in St Anns, Nottingham. The family reported them missing so <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> reveal their address; Craig applied to be re-housed in Lincolnshire to escape the family's influence, but that application was rejected. When no permanent place became available, the Hudsons moved back to the family home in Stockhill, where the violence towards her began.|$|E

25|$|On December 5, 2008, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal {{held that}} her {{statements}} {{were taken in}} violation of her Miranda rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> have inevitably {{found it in the}} normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Hirsi Ali is a {{prominent}} opponent of female genital mutilation (FGM), {{which she has}} criticized in many of her writings. When in Dutch parliament, she proposed obligatory annual medical checks for all uncircumcised girls living in the Netherlands who came from countries where FGM is practised. She proposed that if a physician found that a Dutch girl had been mutilated, a report to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> be required– with protection of the child prevailing over privacy. In 2004 she also criticized male circumcision, particularly as practiced by Jews and Muslims, which she regarded as being another variant of mutilation practiced {{without the consent of}} the individual.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, September 23, 1957, nine black {{students}} entered Central High. These nine students were Elizabeth Eckford, Minnijean Brown, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrance Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls. When word spread {{that the students}} were inside, a crowd of approximately 1,000 gathered outside the school. There was a concern that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to}} handle the crowd so {{for the safety of the}} students they were escorted back out of the school for the day. A force of 150 Guardsmen had been assembled and placed on five-minute notice to assist the police at Central, but they were not called on.|$|E

25|$|On September 29, 1973, {{there was}} a {{national}} protest at Besançon; 100,000 persons demonstrated under pouring rain. The protest was nicknamed the marche des 100,000 (March of 100,000). Chérêque of the CFDT disapproved of this demonstration, fearing that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> be provoked. An old farmer then went to see Michel Rocard {{and told him that}} he had heard, during a family meeting, a member of the special police forces boast that he had thrown Molotov cocktails and burned more cars than the May '68 demonstrators. Rocard decided to send a letter to the organizers of the demonstration, warning them. The demonstration was non-violent.|$|E
25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E
25|$|Stallard {{had never}} ridden a massed event {{on the open}} road in Britain. The English cycle-racing {{authorities}} had, {{since the end of}} the 19th century, banned racing on the roads, fearing <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>would</b> ban all cycling as a result. The National Cyclists' Union, the governing body, demanded races be held only on tracks and, later, on circuits such as airfields that were closed to traffic. Although time trials (races between individuals competing against the clock) had started as a revolt against the NCU's ban – the races were held at dawn on courses kept secret from the public with riders dressed from head to toe in black to complete the secrecy – there were no races on open roads between riders starting together.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the former}} Interior Minister Cristian David {{declared}} that <b>the</b> Border <b>Police</b> <b>would</b> be gradually integrated into <b>the</b> National <b>Police</b> until 2010 or 2011, when Romania {{was expected to}} join the Schengen Area, <b>the</b> Border <b>Police</b> keeps its current status and remains the sole agency tasked with border security and passport control.|$|R

50|$|A {{police officer}} finds a goat roaming {{the streets of}} Bansha and, presuming her to be either a loiterer or a prostitute ('Stholler', as used in the poem, has both of these definitions), announces that he will soon send her off to prison. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> officer and <b>the</b> goat argue over the {{circumstances}} of her arrest, {{and whether or not}} <b>the</b> <b>police</b> officer <b>would</b> actually {{be able to get a}} conviction for a crime not committed. At the end of the song, the goat accuses <b>the</b> <b>police</b> officer of being drunk, and asserts that if she had had enough money to purchase illegal liquor for <b>the</b> <b>police</b> officer, <b>would</b> have been allowed to go free.|$|R
