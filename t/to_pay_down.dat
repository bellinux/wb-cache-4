5|$|While {{political}} maneuvering {{was continuing}} in Minnesota, by early April {{it was reported}} that Nashville had become the favored place for relocation over New Orleans. The Nashville offer became the preferred option as it included $80 million for the franchise from Gaylord Entertainment and an additional $20 million to be paid to the city of Minneapolis <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> debt at the Target Center. New Orleans later reemerged as the lead candidate for relocation by the end of April when Top Rank announced a purchase price of $152.5 million. By early May, the Minnesota state legislature approved a bill that would use public funds to purchase the Target Center for $48 million. The purchase by the state was contingent on ownership agreeing to keep the franchise in the arena for 30 years. However, ownership could not find a local suitor willing to pay what Top Rank had offered for the franchise setting the stage for relocation.|$|E

25|$|During Guthrie's tenure, the {{treasury}} had large budget surpluses {{due to the}} discovery of gold in California. He used much of these surpluses <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> the national debt, which shrank from $63 million in 1853 to $25 million in 1857. He also purchased silver bullion for coinage which aided struggling banks by returning money to circulation and increasing their depleted reserves. He encouraged more efficient processes in the Treasury Department as a whole, and required monthly, rather than quarterly, reports from customs agents. In 1853, he employed Captain Alexander Bowman of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of an extension to the Treasury Building's south wing. Many considered Guthrie to be the ablest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton.|$|E

25|$|These {{conflicts}} put {{an enormous}} {{strain on the}} resources of the Republic, however, and for that reason the Republic (like its opponent, the France of Louis XIV) was deeply in debt {{at the end of the}} War of the Spanish Succession. The regents of the Republic more or less abandoned its Great-Power pretensions after 1713, cutting down on its military preparedness in a vain attempt <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> this overhang of public debt. That debt brought a significant rentier class into being that helped change the nature of the economy from one invested primarily in trade and industry into one in which a significant financial sector played a dominant role. By the end of the 18th century the Republic was the major market for sovereign debt, and a major source of foreign direct investment.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} were obligated {{to repay the}} loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day {{in the guise of}} the state owned KfW bank, (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> the debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{first debate}} between Linda McMahon and Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 Senate race {{occurred}} on October 4, 2010, moderated by Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier and televised live on Fox Connecticut. In the debate, McMahon identified Blumenthal {{as a career}} politician, touted her job creation record while CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, criticized Washington partisanship for Republicans not being invited {{to the negotiating table}} during healthcare reform discussions in Congress, and stated that remaining stimulus dollars were a waste that should now be used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> debt. Blumenthal as well criticized partisanship, saying that he would have sided with Republicans who voted against the Troubled Assets Relief Program. He also used the debate to argue that middle class tax cuts should not have to wait for current tax rates on top income earners to be extended, stated that he would oppose special interests in Washington, and criticized McMahon for outsourcing WWE products overseas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift has {{been related to}} the debt {{deflation}} theory of economic crises, being called [...] "the paradox of debt" [...] – people save not to increase savings, but rather <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> debt. [...] As well, a paradox of toil and a paradox of flexibility have been proposed: A willingness to work more in a liquidity trap and wage flexibility after a debt deflation shock may lead not only to lower wages, but lower employment.|$|E
50|$|After the war, the Liberty bonds were {{reaching}} maturity, but the Treasury {{was unable}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> each <b>down</b> fully with only limited budget surpluses.

50|$|A July 2012 {{survey of}} balance sheet {{recession}} research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by household leverage levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the subprime mortgage crisis. In other words, according to the accounting equation, as {{the value of their}} primary asset (homes) fell, mortgage debt initially remained fixed, so equity also fell, causing the ratio of debt to equity (a measure of leverage) to rise. This sudden increase in leverage, causing consumers to shift from spending <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> <b>down</b> debt, can account for a significant decline in employment levels, as employers cut back due to concerns of lower consumer demand. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.|$|R
2500|$|Corbyn has campaigned against Private Finance Initiative (PFI) schemes; {{supported}} {{a higher rate}} of income tax for the wealthiest in society [...] and John McDonnell, his shadow chancellor, proposed the introduction of a £10 per hour living wage.

In June 2011, Gingrich was the first Republican presidential candidate to sign the Lean Six Sigma [...] "Strong America Now" [...] pledge. The pledge commits to reducing federal government spending and starting <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>down</b> the national debt by 2017.

At a fundraiser in 2004, she told a crowd of financial donors that [...] "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you" [...] but that [...] "We're saying that for America {{to get back on}} track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you.
