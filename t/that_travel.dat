5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{after the}} closing of his father's estate and sale his father's property, he moved west to {{homestead}} and farm at Manitoba, in the Little Saskatchewan district, near Minnedosa. A few years later, {{he had come to}} the realization that farming was not an efficient means of business for him; his farm had been situated in an area that was so far removed from a town <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> to deliver his products had been cumbersome. He then gained employment as a carpenter and builder with the Manitoba and North Western Railway, where he was tasked with building rail bridges and stations. He would later move to Winnipeg where he continued working in his field. He would join the contracting firm of Murray & McDermot, serving as foreman on various projects, including the building of the Manitoba Hotel. After some 13 years, he went to Carberry, Manitoba where he continued contracting, this time also entering the furniture business. In 1902, he would also be involved {{in the construction of the}} Union Bank building there.|$|E

5|$|MT 87 {{begins at}} the MontanaIdaho state line, {{traveling}} through Raynolds Pass. The highway proceeds northward, intersecting a small road before entering rural areas within Gallatin National Forest. The route continues northeast, intersecting several forest roads before bending northwestward. The route intersects several small roads while it runs parallel to a small creek. It crosses over the Madison River after passing several small buildings. The highway continues northwestward to its northern terminus, an at-grade intersection with US 287. The highway is maintained by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT). Part of {{the job of the}} MDT is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> along a portion of the highway. In 2011, the highway had an AADT count of 583 vehicles. No portion of the highway is listed as part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E

5|$|Several {{months after}} opening in December 2015, a Sefton Council {{committee}} meeting recorded {{that the road}} was being very well used, with noticeably less traffic on the roads it was bypassing, those being the Northern Perimeter Road and Lydiate Lane respectively. It was subsequently reported in January 2016 that {{a section of the}} road would need to undergo a series of repair works during the evenings of a three-week period, just five months after the road opened to traffic. A year after opening, road users were giving generally positive feedback, with some confirming <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> times had been reduced and offers a more convenient means of accessing the motorways, although a common recurring concern were the junction issues at Switch Island.|$|E
5|$|The company {{operates}} both regional {{trains to}} Gjøvik, {{as well as}} line 300, the Oslo Commuter Rail, to Hakadal or Jaren. Most north-bound trains originate at Oslo Central Station (OsloS), but some rush-hour services start at Skøyen, and operate through the Oslo Tunnel to OsloS, to serve large working districts of Oslo. NSB Gjøvikbanen has a train leave and depart OsloS every 40minutes; however, the trains have three different stopping patterns and termini, giving {{each of the three}} services a two-hour headway. Two services are commuter trains, and stop at all stations. The one operates until Hakadal, while the other operates until Jaren. In addition, there is a regional services that operates to Gjøvik. The regional service only calls at the major stations until Grua, but serves all stations after <b>that.</b> <b>Travel</b> time from OsloS to Hakadal is 40 minutes, to Jaren it is 1 hour 22 minutes, while it is 1 hour 55 minutes to Gjøvik. The Gjøvik Line accounts for six percent of passenger transport on the national rail network.|$|E

5|$|The {{highway is}} {{maintained}} by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) {{who is responsible for}} constructing and maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, ADOT surveys volumes of traffic on their highways. These surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is the number of vehicles <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> a road during an average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that an average of only 450 vehicles used the road daily at both termini.

5|$|Though {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the leading}} goalkeepers of his era, he never played for his native country. Trautmann met with the German national coach, Sepp Herberger, in 1953, who explained <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> and political implications prevented him from selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he were playing in a German league. Consequently, Trautmann's international isolation prevented him from playing in the 1954 World Cup, in which his countrymen were victorious. Trautmann's only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players in the Football League representative team for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.|$|E
5|$|Two large reservoirs, Shasta Lake and Trinity Lake, {{are formed}} {{by a pair}} of dams in the {{mountains}} north of the Sacramento Valley. Water from both of these lakes are released into the Sacramento River, which flows to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, at controlled rates. There, before it can flow on to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, some of the water is intercepted by a diversion channel and transported to the Delta-Mendota Canal, which conveys water southwards through the San Joaquin Valley, supplying water to San Luis Reservoir (a SWP-shared facility) and the San Joaquin River at Mendota Pool in the process, eventually reaching canals that irrigates farms in the valley. Friant Dam crosses the San Joaquin River upstream of Mendota Pool, diverting its water southwards into canals <b>that</b> <b>travel</b> into the Tulare Lake area of the San Joaquin Valley, as far south as the Kern River. Finally, New Melones Lake, a separate facility, stores water flow of a San Joaquin River tributary for use during dry periods.
