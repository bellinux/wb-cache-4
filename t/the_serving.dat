5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by <b>the</b> <b>serving</b> of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{served as}} {{chairman}} from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and <b>the</b> <b>serving</b> England captain. Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly. While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey, who had successful careers and {{were part of a}} strong English batting line-up. At least one member of the England team, Jim Laker, resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals. Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place; critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of Les Jackson for reasons of class. Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed. He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain, and speaking to the press. In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, <b>the</b> <b>serving</b> captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship. When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.|$|E

5|$|Northallerton was {{formerly}} a parliamentary borough. Its first representatives were John le Clerk and Stephen Maunsell, who were {{elected to the}} parliament of King Edward I in 1298, {{but for some reason}} or other no subsequent return was made until 1640, when the privilege was again resumed by order of the House of Commons. From 1640 to 1885 The town formed the parliamentary borough of Northallerton, returning two Members of Parliament until 1832, and one thereafter. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, boundaries were extended to include neighbouring Brompton and Romanby and its representation was reduced to a single member. In 1885 the constituency was abolished and was absorbed into the Richmond division of the North Riding. <b>The</b> <b>serving</b> member for Richmond constituency is the Conservative, Rishi Sunak, who has held the seat since 2015 when he succeeded former party leader and Foreign Secretary William Hague.

2500|$|A serve (or, more formally, a [...] "service") {{in tennis}} is a shot {{to start a}} point. <b>The</b> <b>serve</b> is {{initiated}} by tossing {{the ball into the}} air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching <b>the</b> net. <b>The</b> <b>serve</b> may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. If the ball hits the net on <b>the</b> first <b>serve</b> and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a [...] "let" [...] and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. There can also be a let if <b>the</b> server <b>serves</b> <b>the</b> ball and the receiver isn't prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on <b>the</b> second <b>serve,</b> then they get one more try to get <b>the</b> <b>serve</b> in <b>the</b> box.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and <b>the</b> <b>serving</b> of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still <b>the</b> <b>serving</b> British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E

50|$|Serve and volley is a {{style of}} play in tennis where <b>the</b> player <b>serving</b> moves quickly towards the net after hitting a <b>serve.</b> <b>The</b> server then {{attempts}} to hit a volley (a shot where the ball is struck without allowing it to bounce), {{as opposed to the}} baseline style, where the server stays back following <b>the</b> <b>serve</b> and attempts to hit a ground stroke (a shot where the ball is allowed to bounce before contact is made). <b>The</b> <b>serve</b> and volley style of play has diminished in recent years with advances in racquet and string technologies which allow players to generate a great amount of top spin on ground strokes and passing shots. The slowing of court surfaces and deflation of balls, promoting longer rallies for the enjoyment of spectators, has also put a damper on <b>the</b> <b>serve</b> and volley style. Some also claim that a lack of teaching of <b>the</b> <b>serve</b> and volley to juniors, who are too small to effectively employ this method, has caused it to become obsolete in grassroots tennis.|$|R
