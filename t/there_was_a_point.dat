5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E

Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, and I have a lot of respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E
500|$|Raised in Columbia, Maryland, Greenwald {{first went}} to a Guitar Center store at age 14 to buy his first {{electric}} guitar. After that however, he rarely went to the former shop and instead bought equipment from local stores like Atomic Music in Beltsville, Maryland {{for most of his}} life. He disliked Guitar Center for its [...] "dystopian" [...] and [...] "unpleasant" [...] environment, {{which was one of the}} major parts of him being influenced to make No Stairway: [...] "I wanted to take something unattractive and be able to extract beauty from it. I wanted to make that environment float on a cloud. [...] I wanted to inspect little nuances, capture them, and paint with them." [...] While living in New York City, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> where Greenwald became bankrupt and wanted to create great-sounding tracks with no budget whatsoever without the need of using samples from a digital audio workstation or other computer software. While waiting for the train one day, he went to a Guitar Center store near Atlantic Terminal out of boredom. At the store, he heard someone playing a Green Day song on an electric guitar and noticed the instrument's poor tone: ...|$|E

500|$|According to the 2010 book, The Red Hot Chili Peppers: An Oral/Visual History, Frusciante had {{originally}} {{intended for the}} album to {{be very different from}} how it was eventually completed. Frusciante wanted an album of two different types of songs: songs that were more [...] "English-sounding" [...] and melodic, and songs that were more punk-rock sounding. Frusciante's punk inspiration came from listening to music by The Damned and Discharge, among others. Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material. However, one punk rock influenced song was recorded during these sessions, [...] "Body of Water," [...] but did not make the final cut and was instead included on [...] "The Zephyr Song" [...] single. Many of the more melodic inspired songs came from Frusciante being heavily into music by The Beach Boys and The Beatles along with doo-wop groups and their harmonies. These new styles as well as Frusciante being especially prolific during this era came to alienate Flea, who'd wanted the band to return to its earlier funk-influenced sound. Frusciante felt the band had already thoroughly explored funk and was more interested in creating something new for the band. According to Kiedis, Flea felt his voice wasn't being heard, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> where he considered leaving the band. While speaking to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, Frusciante mentioned that he listened to guitarists such as John McGeoch for his work on the Magazine's albums and Siouxsie and the Banshees' Juju, Ron Mael of Sparks [...] for Kimono My House, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and Keith Levine of PiL. He also credits XTC singer/guitarist Andy Partridge in the 2002 issue of Total Guitar magazine for being an influence on his guitar work for the album.|$|E

Malati (Shyamsundar's wife) sounded the closing gong, after the track had built to what author Simon Leng {{describes as a}} [...] "dervishlike climax". Apple employees Mal Evans and Chris O'Dell attended this session also. The latter, along with her mother, joined the backing chorus, at Shyamsundar's invitation.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with series creator Reki Kawahara, when asked whether Kirito's personality and character were based off his own, the author responded {{that he does not}} usually put aspects of himself into his characters, and jokingly remarked that [...] "but if I had to say <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming parties. We [...] tend to play solo in these games a lot." [...] He also added that he wrote the series to change popular opinion of online gaming; viewing it not a social ill or just an escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. When fans asked him about Kirito using a sword in a gun-based game, Kawahara responded that the energy sword in Halo can be the most powerful weapon if used properly.|$|E
2500|$|Within the series, Maggie's {{relationship}} with Henry soon ends, but {{the character is}} not heavily romantically linked with any other man for months and Maggie's {{relationship with}} Bianca continues to deepen. Hendrickson was perplexed by this aspect. [...] "Maggie was asexual for a long time. It was frustrating, and I was getting confused how I should play it," [...] said Hendrickson. [...] "So I kept it honest: She loved Bianca as a friend. There was a possibility that she could love her more intimately. She still does love her, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> in time when she might have thought otherwise. But ultimately she likes men." [...] Despite Hendrickson's early views about the character's sexual orientation, the show continued to showcase Maggie sending [...] "mixed signals" [...] to Bianca, with her romantic feelings for Bianca coming through as intense. The character is shown to resort to having sex with good guy and best friend Jamie Martin on several occasions to bury these feelings, though most of her sexual interaction with Jamie takes place offscreen. Maggie's romantic attraction to Bianca finally gets the better of her, and she impulsively kisses her. Maggie panics, however, and tells Bianca it meant nothing. Heartbroken, she finds comfort in Jamie.|$|E

[...] The episode was selected as recommended viewing by several TV critics, including Dydd Iau of the Liverpool Daily Post, and Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury, who noted: [...] "It sounds a bit strange, but there's snow, carols and an uplifting happy ending for a change." [...] The Mirror Maeve Quigley called it [...] "a timeless story", though questioned the plausibility of {{a world in which}} Elliot's patients went untreated, as [...] "the NHS isn't a one- man band after all". In contrast, Robert Hanks of The Independent reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "incompetent to the point of sacrilege". Hanks wrote: [...] "What it did add to the mix, that James Stewart never achieved, was to give the viewer an authentic frisson of empathy: <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> towards the end - during an encounter with Elliot's miraculously resurrected, motor-neurone-disease-afflicted yet remarkably soignée and articulate wife - when I began to see never having been born as preferable, sometimes, to prime-time TV." ...|$|E
