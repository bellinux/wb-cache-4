5|$|The figure {{eventually}} {{turns to}} {{its right to}} look at the hand. By this time, the leaves outside are still. The figure <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the camera, now steady, again briefly, then back to its hand. After a series of jump cuts in which they turn rapidly {{back and forth between the}} two positions, the figure looks directly at the camera and points to it.|$|E
5|$|Azar and {{a healer}} provide {{alternative}} treatment for Waterston, who fully recovers. He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but {{it turns out to be}} Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of the last few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E
6000|$|He went on grumbling as he walked. I {{followed}} him. Halfway {{across the}} field we met {{the owner of the}} voice. She was a pleasant-looking lass, not exactly pretty--not the sort of girl one <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> in a crowd--yet, having seen her, it was agreeable to continue looking at her. St. Leonard introduced me to her as his eldest daughter, Janie, and explained to her that behind the study door, if only she would take the trouble to look, she would find a time-table - ...|$|E
60|$|The Major gave an {{involuntary}} start, and then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him curiously.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Andre {{across the}} wide space that now {{separated}} them.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Joe again. He {{was staring}} as blankly as ever.|$|R
6000|$|CHRIS--[Hurriedly.] Ay go up bow. All hands asleep 'cepting fallar on vatch. Ay gat heave line to dat fallar. [He {{picks up}} a coil of rope and hurries off toward the bow. ANNA walks back toward the extreme stern {{as if she wanted}} to remain as much {{isolated}} possible. She turns her back on the proceedings and stares out into the fog. THE VOICE is heard again shouting [...] "Ahoy" [...] and CHRIS answering [...] "Dis way" [...] Then there is a pause--the murmur of excited voices--then the scuffling of feet. CHRIS appears from around the cabin to port. He is supporting the limp form of a man dressed in dungarees, holding one of the man's arms around his neck. The deckhand, JOHNSON, a young, blond Swede, follows him, helping along another exhausted man similar fashion. ANNA <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. Chris stops for a second--volubly.] Anna! You come help, vill you? You find vhiskey in cabin. Dese fallars need drink for fix dem. Dey vas near dead.|$|E
50|$|In the Batcave, Carrie disembarks {{from the}} Batmobile and {{approaches}} the Batcomputer terminal. Bruce Wayne stands {{there with a}} crutch and <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her with an unreadable expression.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Rembrandt's 1660 {{depiction}} of Peter's Denial. Jesus, {{in the upper}} right hand corner, is at the high priest's house, his hands bound behind him, and <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Peter.|$|E
60|$|Trot <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{her sweet}} face was grave and curious.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the newcomer, {{and saw the}} Lizard {{directly}} behind him.|$|R
60|$|This time he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. The old dagger {{was drawn}} in her.|$|R
5000|$|The DVD {{features}} exclusive backstage {{footage of}} the concert, including a look into the dancers' dressing rooms and a prank played on Kylie during the show entitled 'Will Kylie Crack'. The prank consist of stage personnel doing random things below the stage where Kylie can see them when she <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the back drop during [...] "So Now Goodbye".|$|E
50|$|The figure {{eventually}} {{turns to}} {{its right to}} look at the hand. By this time the leaves outside are still. The figure <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the camera, now steady, again briefly, then back to its hand. After a series of jump cuts in which it turns rapidly {{back and forth between the}} two positions, it looks directly at the camera and points to it.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{criteria}} for sunglasses worn when piloting an aircraft {{are similar to those}} for land vehicles. Protection against UV radiation is more important, as its intensity increases with altitude. Polarised glasses are undesirable as aircraft windscreens are often polarised, intentionally or unintentionally, showing Moiré patterns on looking through the windscreen; and some LCDs used by instruments emit polarised light, and can dim or disappear when the pilot <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|E
60|$|A picador {{passes on}} horseback in his uncouth clothes, and all <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|In sheer amazement M. Binet {{checked in}} his stride, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his companion.|$|R
60|$|Alora <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her father. He was filing {{his pipe}} and scowling more darkly than ever.|$|R
5000|$|As Q {{is leaving}} the rooftop, a crowd from the party gathers to see what happened. One {{of the people in}} the crowd turns to Q and says, [...] "Yo, you got the juice now, man." [...] Q <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, shakes his head in disgust, and walks away. The film ends with a {{flashback}} clip of the four friends together in happier times as Bishop yells, [...] "Wrecking Crew!" ...|$|E
50|$|Two months later, {{everyone}} is attending a wedding. Gaby {{is still trying}} to keep Ana in line, catching her flirting with a man at the wedding. Lynette excuses herself as she rushes to the bathroom, likely due to morning sickness. Bree is seen sitting next to Orson, but slowly <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Karl, indicating they are likely still seeing one another. The scene ends on Mike as the groom, kissing an unidentified bride.|$|E
50|$|Like the London self-portrait, the {{painting}} is dominated by black and dark brown hues, with red overtones. De Leeuw {{is presented as a}} serious young man with a rather intense gaze. He is wearing a black chaperon and black fur lined jacket. He <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the viewer while holding a gold ring band with a red jewel, a symbol of his profession, although some have suggested that it might indicate a recent marriage engagement, or even, given his direct gaze, that the painted is meant for his intended.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} the prince <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his sister. She was gazing earnestly into his face.|$|R
60|$|She neither <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him nor spoke. No ghost or {{stranger}} {{could have}} passed more silently.|$|R
60|$|He {{gripped his}} knees and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me again. For half a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.|$|R
50|$|One day, things {{begin to}} change. On {{a trip to}} the local grocery store for potatoes, Vernon sees the store owner, an old man named Milt, arguing with a {{customer}} over the price of the potatoes. Vernon has the same argument with Milt, as Steph had gone to his store a few days before and bought potatoes for the same price. Milt kicks Vernon out of the store, and the customer interrupts him on the way out to tell him he had done well. Vernon <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her and discovers that the customer was Maxine.|$|E
50|$|Maliella runs in, {{with the}} Camorrists after her. Rafaele is in pursuit, he being {{the leader of}} the band, a handsome, flashy blackguard. When he {{advances}} to seize and kiss her, she draws out a hat pin. Laughing, he throws off his coat, like a duellist, grasps and holds her tightly. She stabs his hand, making it bleed, then throws away the pin. He laughs disdainfully, passionately kisses the wound. There is an extended scene with accepting and rejecting flowers, wearing them, tossing them away. Rafaele heads for the inn - she <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{split screen}} effect is {{used during the}} first scene of a boy and girl using their powers to stop their 'brother' {{stealing}} a puzzle box; the close ups of the mother holding the boy as his eyes begin to glow and she <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him are achieved as above this time without a black line separating the freeze frames of the boy from the live motion of the mother. The final effect of the children's eyes zooming out of the flames of their burning school house utilized multiple exposures of a model head with glowing eyes which the camera zoomed in on.|$|E
60|$|Receiver <b>to</b> ear, he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Paula. Graham, {{bending over}} her but not {{touching}} her, met his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{walked slowly}} to the bow. As he did this, Wingate <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him in a {{speculative}} way.|$|R
60|$|James {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Mary, who was coming towards him with letters in her hand.|$|R
50|$|The Fog Warning is a {{painting}} with a narrative, though its tale is disturbing rather than charming. As {{indicated by the}} halibut in his dory, the fisherman in this picture has been successful. But the hardest task of the day, the return to the main ship, is still ahead of him. He <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the horizon, measuring {{the distance to the}} mother ship, and to safety. The seas are choppy and the dory rocks high on the waves, making it clear that the journey home will require considerable physical effort. But more threatening is the approaching fog bank, whose streamers echo, even mock, the fisherman's profile.|$|E

He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the movie}} reveals that an Israeli soldier, Youssef (Maher Bsaibes), {{stationed}} at the border {{is in love with}} Lamia. After Lamia comes to live in Samy’s house, she barely eats or sleeps or talks; this goes on for 20 days. Later, during an argument with her husband, Lamia tells him that she loves someone else, who turns out to be Youssef. Samy’s family gets frustrated with Lamia and takes her to the border so that she can talk to her mother. Lamia is given binoculars, but instead of looking at her mother, she <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Youssef and exchanges smiles with him. Both families fume at this and her binoculars are taken away.|$|E
60|$|James <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his uncle, noting {{a little}} contemptuously {{the change of}} his costume, and its extravagant juvenility.|$|R
60|$|They <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the bird, which fluttered {{its wings}} and {{stared back at}} them with its big eyes.|$|R
60|$|But when Boabdil was {{crossing}} the mountains he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the city he had lost, {{and burst into}} tears.|$|R
