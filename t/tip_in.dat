5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the <b>tip)</b> <b>in</b> shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1938, the Mingo Oak failed to produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state {{forester}} D.B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing {{theory is that the}} tree died from the release of poisonous gases and sulfur fumes from a burning spoil <b>tip</b> <b>in</b> nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections being sent to the Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Patricia set {{multiple}} {{records for}} maximum strength, rate of intensification, {{and rate of}} weakening throughout its relatively short existence. With maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere. In terms of central pressure, {{it is also the}} second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, just shy of Typhoon <b>Tip</b> <b>in</b> 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone, surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00UTC October22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph (140km/h) to 205mph (335km/h), a record increase of 120mph (195km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95mbar (hPa; 2.81inHg). Despite record over-water weakening prior to striking Mexico, Patricia became the most intense Pacific hurricane to make landfall, with a pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.52inHg).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Patricia was the second-most intense {{tropical}} cyclone on record worldwide, behind Typhoon <b>Tip</b> <b>in</b> 1979, {{with a minimum}} atmospheric pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg). Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, south of Mexico, in mid-October2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October20. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within {{the first day of}} its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category5 hurricane in just 24hours—a near-record pace. On October23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h). This made it the most intense {{tropical cyclone}} on record in the Western Hemisphere, and the strongest globally in terms of 1-minute maximum sustained winds.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the <b>tip</b> <b>in</b> all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there was no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
5|$|The Shetland {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} British breeds. The ewes are usually polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, although horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is noted for its very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool on their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the <b>tip</b> <b>in</b> hair, not wool.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{contemporary}} documents describing the design or methods of {{construction of the}} canal and nothing about its opening. However, a report from 1632 on alterations to the river noted that 600 men {{were involved in the}} work, so presumably there was sufficient labour locally for such tasks. Wigmore probably used handbills at local inns to recruit his workers, since there were no newspapers to carry advertisements. The work would have been done using pickaxes, shovels and wheelbarrows. The excavated ditch was then lined with blue clay to make it watertight. Excavations for a sewer in 1974 and work on a rubbish <b>tip</b> <b>in</b> 1979 revealed the layers of blue clay, and there were clay pits near Stamford, which supported a pottery industry, although their precise location is unknown.|$|E
5|$|With maximum {{sustained}} {{winds of}} 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Hurricane Patricia is the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever observed, {{just shy of}} Typhoon <b>Tip</b> <b>in</b> 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). It is also the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. It exceeded the previous sustained wind record of 190mph (305km/h) set by Hurricane Allen in 1980 and the pressure record of 882mbar (hPa; 26.05inHg) set by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, both in the Atlantic basin. In the Eastern Pacific basin, north of the equator and east of the International Dateline, the previous basin record-holder was Hurricane Linda in 1997 with winds of 185mph (295km/h) and a pressure of 902mbar (hPa; 26.64inHg). Reconnaissance also found a pressure gradient of 24mbar (hPa; 0.71inHg) per nautical mile early on October23, among the steepest gradients ever observed in a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at the <b>tip.</b> <b>In</b> A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at the tip. The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a small, brown Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded <b>tip.</b> <b>In</b> M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E
