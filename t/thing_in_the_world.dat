Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends remark that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town so upset. When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity is the most important <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks {{out of the house and}} decapitates the statue.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

[...] Michael W. Phillips, Jr. concurs, calling the film [...] "a marked improvement on the original film [...] still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright." [...] Phillips again praises Holden's performance and also Pichel's portrayal of Sandor, but finds the rest of the cast weak.|$|E
500|$|Sappho 16 is a {{fragment}} of a poem by the archaic Greek lyric poet Sappho. [...] It is from Book I of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry, and is known from a second-century papyrus discovered at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. [...] Sappho 16 is a love poem – the genre for which Sappho was best known – which praises the beauty of the narrator's beloved, Anactoria, and expresses the speaker's desire for her now that she is absent. [...] It makes the case that the most beautiful <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is whatever one desires, using Helen of Troy's elopement with Paris as a mythological exemplum to support this argument. [...] The poem is at least 20 lines long, though it is uncertain whether the poem ends at line 20 or continues for another stanza.|$|E

Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003.

500|$|Riegels {{sent letters}} to athletes who made similar mistakes.

Riegels wrote in the letter: [...] "For many years I've had to go along and laugh whenever my wrong-way run was brought up, even though I've grown tired listening and reading about it. But it certainly wasn't the most serious <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> I regretted doing it, even as you do, but you'll get over it." [...] In addition, during an NFL game in 1964 between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota defensive end Jim Marshall ran a recovered fumble 66 yards into his own end zone (resulting in a safety, but the Vikings won 27–22). Riegels reportedly later sent Marshall a letter reading [...] "Welcome to the club".|$|E

Adding to his guilt is when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are upset as well, telling Bart that they would attack the culprit {{critically}} as they did not actually mean what they said about the statue before. Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would face if his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular was the most important <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that Homer told him. It was then Homer realized that he inspired Bart of his popularity advice that caused him to commit the crime in the first place, and feels extremely guilty of doing so. Bart then decides to return the head back where it belongs, and Homer follows along, holding himself responsible for the events. They are found by the angry mob, returning the story to the beginning.|$|E

500|$|In a {{collection}} of Renaissance metalwork Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71) represents the ultimate attribution, as his genuine works as a goldsmith are rarer than paintings by Giorgione. [...] In his 1902 catalogue Charles Hercules Read mentions {{that many of the}} pendants had been attributed to Cellini, but refrains from endorsing the attributions. [...] A small silver hand-bell (WB.95) had belonged to Horace Walpole, who praised it extravagantly in a letter as [...] "the uniquest <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> a silver bell for an inkstand made by Benvenuto Cellini. It makes one believe all the extravagant encomiums he bestows on himself; indeed so does his Perseus. Well, my bell is in the finest taste, and is swarmed by caterpillars, lizards, grasshoppers, flies, and masques, that you would take it for one of the plagues of Egypt. They are all in altissimo, nay in out-issimo relievo and yet almost invisible but with a glass. Such foliage, such fruitage!" [...] However Baron Ferdinand had realized that it was more likely to be by Wenzel Jamnitzer, goldsmith to the Emperor Rudolf II, to whom it is still attributed. [...] Another piece no longer attributed to Cellini is a large bronze door-knocker, with a figure of Neptune, 40cm high, and weighing over 11 kilos.|$|E

The cover art depicts a child hopscotching off a cliff and a gathering of kids waiting to follow, a concept that begun with bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu and sketched by a friend of Jonathan Davis before being submitted to McFarlane. It marked the third straight Korn cover featuring children in a disturbing context, which Davis explained by saying that [...] "Children are always scared when they're all happy and stuff.
