The second daughter of a noted barrister and a renowned classical scholar, {{she and her sister}} were encouraged by her father, whom she remembered as a deeply loving and caring parent, to read and use their imaginations. Writing about her childhood many years later, she recalled how vividly her father described characters from various books and the infinite world of knowledge and adventure that lay on <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>page.</b> She noted that the desire to read, which soon transformed into a need to write, was a legacy from her father that would be hers for a lifetime.|$|E

500|$|Like Angelou's two {{previous}} autobiographies, Singin' and Swingin' [...] received mostly positive reviews.

500|$|According to Professor John Meisel, {{who wrote}} a book about the 1957 campaign, Diefenbaker's {{speaking}} style was [...] "reminiscent of the fiery orators so popular in the nineteenth century. Indeed, Mr. Diefenbaker's oratory has been likened to that of the revivalist preacher." [...] As a new face on the national scene given to outspoken attacks on the government, he began to attract unexpectedly large crowds early in the campaign. When reduced to the written word, however, Diefenbaker's rhetoric sometimes proved to be without much meaning. According to journalist and author Peter C.

50|$|In {{order for}} the pages {{to come out in}} the correct order, the {{printers}} would have to properly lay out the pages of type in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> press.

If a printer was printing a folio in 8s, as described above, he would have to <b>print</b> <b>pages</b> 1 and 16 on one side of a leaf with pages 2 and 15 on the other side of that leaf, etc. The arrangement of the pages of type in the press is referred to as the imposition and there are a number of methods of imposing pages for the various formats, some of which involve cutting <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>pages</b> before binding.|$|R

In most of the editions since 1574, the Shulhan ‘Arukh was printed with HaMapah, thus creating an interesting tension that was realized on <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>page.</b> It was an act of integrating the Sephardic tradition and its accommodation into the Ashkenazi world, the confirmation of the authority and its undermining appearing on the same page." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{tradition}} of Lull, Zwemer ‘left behind a mighty highway of print almost a book a year in English for over half a century.’ As part of this great literary undertaking, he settled in Cairo in 1912 {{to work with the}} Nile Mission Press to make it ‘a production point for Christian Literature for Muslims.’ As an outcome of the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference in 1910, he established the quarterly The Moslem World in 1911 because ‘If the Churches of Christendom are to reach the Moslem world with the Gospel, they must know of it and know it.’ He edited it until 1947, paying for much of it out of his own pocket. He founded the American Christian Literature Society for Moslems (A.C.L.S.M) which raised over {{a quarter of a million}} dollars for the production of evangelical literature. Its Constitution expressed Zwemer’s belief that <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> <b>page</b> ‘has a unique value as a means of carrying the Gospel to Mohammedans... finds an entrance into many doors closed to the living witness and can proclaim the Gospel persistently, fearlessly and effectively.’ Zwemer saw printed page as ‘the [...] "leaves for the healing of the nations" [...] in his program of mission strategy.’ ...|$|E
