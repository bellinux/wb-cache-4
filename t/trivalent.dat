5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly <b>trivalent</b> in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the <b>trivalent</b> actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with <b>trivalent</b> lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a <b>trivalent</b> actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium.

Cornops aquaticum is a South-American grasshopper that lives and feeds on water-hyacinths, and has three polymorphic Robertsonian rearrangements in its southernmost distribution area in Central Argentina and Uruguay. The orientation of <b>trivalents</b> in metaphase I, the formation of abnormal spermatids and the frequency and position of chiasmata in the <b>trivalents,</b> was analysed in a polymorphic population of C. aquaticus. In this study we observed a correlation between the number of <b>trivalents</b> with the frequency of abnormal spermatids; additionally, the number of chiasmata, especially proximal and interstitial ones, was strongly correlated with the frequency of the linear orientation. Therefore we confirmed our previous assumption, based on other evidence, that the chiasmata redistribution in fusion carriers is essential to the maintenance of the polymorphisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Rb translocations are {{chromosomal}} rear-rangements frequently {{found in}} natural {{populations of the}} house mouse Mus musculus domesticus. The stan-dard diploid karyotype of the house mouse consisting of 40 telocentric chromosomes may be reduced {{by the emergence of}} metacentric Rb chromosomes. Multiple simple Rb heterozygotes form <b>trivalents</b> exhibiting higher anaphase nondisjunction frequency and conse-quently higher number of unbalanced gametes than in normal males. This work will attempt to establish whether frequencies of aneuploidy observed in hetero-zygote spermatids of the house mouse M. musculus domesticus show differences in chromosomes derived from different <b>trivalents.</b> Towards this goal, the number and distribution frequency of aneuploidy was assessed via FISH staining of specific chromosomes of sperma-tids derived from 2 n= 32 individuals. Our results showed that for a given set of target chromosomes, 90 % of the gametes were balanced, resulting from alternate segregation, and that there were no differences (approx. 10 %) in aneuploidy frequencies in chromo-somes derived from different <b>trivalents.</b> These observa-tions suggest that segregation effectiveness does not depend on the type of chromosomes involved in triva-lents. As a consequence of the <b>trivalent’s</b> configuration, joint segregation of the telocentric chromosomes occurs thus favoring their appearance together in early sperma-tids. Our data suggest that Rb chromosomes and their telocentric homologs are subject to architectural con-straints placing them close to each other. This proximity may ultimately facilitate fusion between them, hence contributing to a prevalence of Rb metacentric chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Failure of {{homologous}} synapsis during meiotic prophase triggers transcriptional repression. Asynapsis of the X and Y chromosomes {{and their}} consequent silencing {{is essential for}} spermatogenesis. However, asynapsis of portions of autosomes in heterozygous translocation carriers may be detrimental for meiotic progression. In fact, {{a wide range of}} phenotypic outcomes from meiotic arrest to normal spermatogenesis have been described and the causes of such a variation remain elusive. To better understand the consequences of asynapsis in male carriers of Robertsonian translocations, we focused on the dynamics of recruitment of markers of asynapsis and meiotic silencing at unsynapsed autosomal <b>trivalents</b> in the spermatocytes of Robertsonian translocation carrier mice. Here we report that the enrichment of breast cancer 1 (BRCA 1) and histone γH 2 AX at unsynapsed <b>trivalents</b> declines during the pachytene stage of meiosis and differs from that observed in the sex body. Furthermore, histone variant H 3. 3 S 31, which associates with the sex chromosomes in metaphase I/anaphase I spermatocytes, localizes to autosomes in 12 % and 31 % of nuclei from carriers of one and three translocations, respectively. These data suggest that the proportion of spermatocytes with markers of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) at <b>trivalents</b> depends on both, the stage of meiosis and the number of translocations. This may explain some of the variability in phenotypic outcomes associated with Robertsonian translocations. In addition our data suggest that the dynamics o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Meiotic {{behaviour}} was {{studied in}} males of the Ctenomys perrensi superspecies from Argentina that show variations in their chromosome number mostly due to Robertsonian translocations (Rb). A significant positive cor-relation between cell chiasma frequencies and total chromosome numbers was found. The reduction in chiasma fre-quency observed in individuals with Rb rearrangements occurred mainly at expenses of proximal and interstitial chi-asmata, although {{significant differences between}} Rb <b>trivalents</b> and bivalents both in chiasma distribution and univa-lent frequency were also observed. Nevertheless, not all changes in chiasma distributions could be ascribed to Rb re-arrangements. Chromosome synapsis was analysed in Rb hetero- and homozygotes. <b>Trivalents</b> showed a high frequency of synapsis at pericentromeric regions, suggesting no mechanical incompatibilities or delay in the synap-tonemal complex formation in such regions. The relationship between chiasma distributions and synaptic patterns is discussed and a hypothesis about the possible role of telocentric or subtelocentric regions in these processes is pro-posed. It is also concluded that one or two Rb translocations in heterozygosis have weak direct effects on the fertility of the male carriers; therefore C. perrensi superspecies may be prone to maintain Rb chromosomal rearrangements...|$|R

We distinguished the chromosomes of both parental species by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), whereas the individual chromosomes were identified {{on the basis of}} their multicolour FISH banding patterns obtained after a second hybridization with two species-specific satellite repeats as probes. All the four BC 1 plants possessed two genomes of A. inodora and one of A. aurea. Variable numbers of recombinant chromosomes, resulting from meiotic recombination in the interspecific hybrid, were present in these plants. The homologous A. inodora chromosomes generally formed bivalents, leaving the homoeologous A. aurea chromosomes unassociated. High frequencies of <b>trivalents</b> were observed for the chromosome sets that contained recombinant chromosomes, even when the recombinant segments were small. Chromosome associations in the <b>trivalents</b> were restricted to homologous segments.

40|$|The hybrid between Arachis duranensis and A. glabrata was a {{triploid}} and had 8 - 11 bivalents {{with a mean}} of 10 bivalents per meiocyte. Ten bivalents {{were observed}} in 30 % of the cells analysed. <b>Trivalents</b> were rarely observed. Forty-eight percent of the pollinations formed pegs when A. duranensis × A. glabrata was pollinated with A. hypogaea pollen. Morphologically, the hybrid had erect growth habit and resembled A. hypogaea. The flower buds had short hypanthium and flowers were pale yellow as observed on A. duranensis. Of the 485 pegs formed, 3 pods were obtained. Two of the pods had large but immature seeds and one pod had a mature seed. Triploid hybrid A. diogoi × A. glabrata was crossed with A. glabrata. The bivalent formation in the hybrid ranged from 7 to 10 {{with a mean of}} 9 per meiocyte. The number of univalents ranged from 10 to 16 with a mean of 12 per meiocyte. Both ring (4 per cell) and rod (6 per cell) bivalents were present. The occurrence of more number of rod than ringbivalents and of 12 univalents in 30 % of the cells showed that there was some restriction in chromosome pairing in A. diogoi × A. glabrata.

The sterile triploids were then doubled with colchicine to obtain fertile hexaploid plants. These plants and their open pollinated progeny varied in their chromosome number from 73 to 82 chromosomes, the majority being the expected 78 chromosomes. Chromosome associations included bivalents, <b>trivalents,</b> quadrivalents, and hexavalents. The caducous bract trait varied from being similar to each parent species to intermediate expression. Backcrossed to G. hirsutum, progeny with 61 to 67 chromosomes were obtained with associations including frequent <b>trivalents,</b> quadrivalents, and one hexavalent. The caducous bract trait was not expressed in most plants and only variable in others. Progeny from open pollination or backcrossing these plants gave chromosome numbers closer to the tetraploid parent, with ranges of 56 to 64 chromosomes in open pollinated progeny and 52 to 58 for backcrossed plants. Again, the caducous bract trait was variable, possibly due {{to the influence of}} the A and D genomes of the New World cottons. Tetraploids recovered from the progeny had bivalent pairing and chiasma frequencies similar to G. hirsutum. Further backcrossing is hoped to increase the expression of the caducous bract trait...|$|R

Both groups display varying degree of chromosome associations. Group I species showed the prevalence of bivalents, however occasional quadrivalents besides univalents were also encountered. About 48 % of the PMCs analyzed in C. mangga showed 21 bivalents (II) meiotic configurations, 32 % in C. comosa and 16 % in C. haritha. Group II species as expected showed the presence of <b>trivalents</b> besides bivalents, univalents and quadrivalents. About 32 % of the PMCs analyzed at MI in C. sylvatica showed 21 <b>trivalents</b> (III) meiotic configurations, 24 % in C. longa and 8 % in C. caesia. Overall, low frequency of multivalent associations as compared to bivalents indicates that Curcuma is an allopolyploid complex. Moreover, x = 21 is too high a basic number, therefore, we suggest that the genus Curcuma has evolved by hybridization of species with different chromosome numbers of 2 n = 24 and 18, resulting in a dibasic amphidiploid species...|$|R

5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals.

Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is <b>trivalent</b> with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a <b>trivalent,</b> silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a <b>trivalent</b> metallic radius of 171pm.

The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number: an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of <b>trivalent,</b> unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides.

Speciation mediated by centric fusions is a peripatric speciation model that does not postulate populational phenomena atypical of those characteristic of most mammals.

IMPF: 03. 40 RONO: 00 Genomic {{in situ hybridization}} (GISH) was {{used to make a}} detailed study of chromosome pairing at metaphase I (MI) of meiosis in six F 1 hybrid plants of the allotetraploid Festuca pratensis ? Lolium perenne (2 n = 4 x = 28; genomic constitution FpFpLpLp). The mean chromosome configurations for all hybrids analysed were 1. 13 univalents + 11. 51 bivalents + 0. 32 <b>trivalents</b> + 0. 72 quadrivalents, and the mean chiasma frequency was 21. 96 per cell. GISH showed that pairing was predominantly intragenomic, with mean numbers of L. perenne (Lp/Lp) and F. pratensis (Fp/Fp) bivalents being virtually equal at 5. 41 and 5. 48 per cell, respectively. Intergenomic pairing between Lolium and Festuca chromosomes was observed in 33. 3 % of Lp/Fp bivalents (0. 62 per cell), in 79. 7 % of <b>trivalents</b> ? Lp/Lp/Fp and Lp/Fp/Fp (0. 25 per cell), and in 98. 4 % of quadrivalents ? Lp/Lp/Fp/Fp and Lp/Lp/Lp/Fp (0. 71 per cell). About 4. 0 % of the total chromosome complement analysed remained as univalents, an average 0. 68 Lp and 0. 45 Fp univalents per cell. It is evident that in these hybrids there is opportunity for recombination to take place between the two component genomes, albeit at a low level, and this is discussed in the context of compromising the stability of Festulolium hybrid cultivars and accounting for the drift in the balance of the genomes over generations. We speculate that genotypic differences between hybrids could permit selection for pairing control, and that preferences for homologous versus homoeologous centromeres in their spindle attachments and movement to the poles at anaphase I could form the basis of a mechanism underlying genome drift.

40|$|Intergeneric hybrids were {{produced}} between hexaploid wheat variety Chinese Spring and five different accessions of Aegilops geniculata; 2 n= 4 x= 28 C U C U M O M O (Aegilops ovata). The {{objective was to}} detect differences in chromosomal associations at meiotic metaphase- 1 in the F l hybrids using squash preparations of prefixed immature anthers. Chromosome pairing between all the hybrids raged between 35 univalents to 3 rod bivalents except for hybrid between Chinese Spring x Ae. geniculata accession 361881. This hybrid exhibited chromosome pairing up to 4 rod bivalents, 1 ring bivalent and 2 <b>trivalents</b> with the chiasma frequency of 4. 10 per cell. This indicated possibilities of homoeologous chromosome pairing and genetic exchange between chromosomes of wheat and of Ae. geniculata. Significance of this pairing and the potential of Ae. geniculata for improvement of stress tolerance in wheat would be discussed in detail...|$|R
