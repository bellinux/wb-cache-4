40|$|This paper {{shows the}} Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) {{technique}} {{developed for the}} complete emulation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) based hybrid systems. This approach {{is based on the}} coupling of an emulator test rig with a real-time software for components which are not included in the plant. The experimental facility is composed of a T 100 microturbine (100 kW electrical power size) modified for the connection to an SOFC emulator device. This component is composed of both anodic and cathodic vessels including also the anodic recirculation system which is carried out with a single stage ejector, driven by an air flow in the primary duct. However, no real stack material was installed in the plant. For this reason, a real-time dynamic software was developed in the Matlab-Simulink environment including all the SOFC system components (the fuel cell stack with the calculation of the electrochemical aspects considering also the real losses, the reformer, and a cathodic recirculation based on a blower, etc.). This tool was coupled with the real system utilizing a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) data exchange approach (the model receives flow data from the plant at the inlet duct of the cathodic vessel, while it is able to operate on the turbine changing its set-point of electrical load or turbine outlet temperature). So, the software is operated to control plant properties to generate the effect of a real SOFC in the rig. In stand-alone mode the turbine load is changed with the objective of matching the measured Turbine Outlet Temperature (TOT) value with the calculated one by the model. In grid-connected mode the software/hardware matching is obtained through a direct manipulation of the TOT set-point. This approach was essential to analyze the matching issues between the SOFC and the micro gas turbine devoting several tests on critical operations, such as start-up, shutdown and load changes. Special attention was focused on tests carried out to solve the control system issues for the entire real hybrid plant emulated with this HIL approach. Hence, the innovative control strategies were developed and successfully tested considering both the Proportional Integral Derivative and advanced approaches. Thanks to the experimental tests carried out with this HIL system, a comparison between different control strategies was performed including a statistic analysis on the results The positive performance obtainable with a Model Predictive Control based technique was shown and discussed. So, <b>the</b> <b>HIL</b> <b>system</b> presented in this paper was essential to perform the experimental tests successfully (for real hybrid system development) without the risks of destroying the stack in case of failures.

40|$|A {{need for}} a cost effective, {{versatile}} {{and easy to use}} suspension component testing method has arisen, following the development of a four-state hydro-pneumatic semi-active spring-damper system. A method known as hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) was investigated, in particular its use and compatibility with tests involving physical <b>systems</b> – previously <b>HiL</b> was used predominantly for Electronic Control Unit (ECU) testing. <b>The</b> suitability of <b>HiL</b> in <b>the</b> development of advanced suspension systems and their control systems, during which various vehicle models can be used, was determined. A first step in vehicle suspension design is estimating a desired spring and damper characteristic, and verifying that characteristic using software simulation. The models used during this step are usually low-order, simple models, which hampers quick development progress. To predict vehicle response before vehicle prototype completion, many researchers have attempted to use complex and advanced damper models to simulate the vehicle’s dynamics, but these models all suffer from some drawback – it is either based on empirical data, giving no indication of the physical parameters of the design sought; it may be overly complex, having many parameters and thus rendering software impractical; or it may be quick but {{based on the premise that}} there is no hysteresis in the damping character. It can be seen that an obvious answer exists – use a physical commercially available or prototype damper in the software simulation instead of the mathematical model. In this way the suspension deflection, i. e. the true motion of the damper is used as excitation, and the true damper force is measured using a hydraulic actuator and load cell. The vehicle mass motions are simulated in a software environment. This is basically what <b>HiL</b> simulation does. <b>The</b> <b>HiL</b> method was verified by comparing HiL simulations and tests to globally accepted testing methods, employing widely-used vehicle models: linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and two-degrees-of-freedom (2 DOF) or quarter-car models were used. <b>The</b> <b>HiL</b> method was also compared to a non-linear physical system to verify that the method holds for real vehicle suspension geometries. This meant that HiL had to perform adequately at both ends of the suspension-testing spectrum – base software and real system simulation. The comparison of <b>the</b> <b>HiL</b> and software/real <b>system</b> simulation was done using the “Error Coefficient of Variance” (ECOV) between the compared signals; this quantitative measure proved very sensitive and performed dubiously in the presence of signal offsets, phase lags and scaling errors, but remains a tangible, measurable parameter with which to compare signals. Visual confirmation was also obtained to back the ECOV values. It was found that even using a relatively low-force actuator, <b>the</b> <b>HiL</b> simulation results followed the software/real system responses well. Phase lags and DC offsets in <b>the</b> <b>HiL</b> simulation’s measured signals (as well as the real systems responses) has an adverse effect on the performance of <b>the</b> <b>HiL</b> simulation.

The model comprehends a detailed physical description of hydraulic cir-cuit, clutches, synchronizers and gears, and simplified vehicle and internal combustion engine sub-models. As the oil circulating in the system has a large bulk modulus, the pressure dynamics are very fast, possibly causing instability in a real-time simulation; the same challenge involves the servo valves dynamics, due to the very small masses of the moving elements.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} design of a model and <b>HIL</b> <b>system</b> {{produced}} to support the development and testing of Electronic Control Unit/Engine Management System (ECU/EMS) software for a V 6 turbo-charged automotive diesel engine. The engine model, developed in Simulink, is compiled to execute on a dSpace platform and interacts with the ECU/EMS module in real time. The main features of the engine model are outlined. The configuration of <b>the</b> model and <b>HIL</b> components are described, and the performance of the system is illustrated and discussed. Practical decisions on the inclusion of real or virtual sensors and actuators, and other implementation issues, are explained. Recent and potential future applications of the system are described...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of high impedance layer (HIL) in (Bi) CMOS millimeter wave on-chip antennas is studied. <b>The</b> <b>HIL</b> consists of grounded two-dimensional periodic dogbone-shaped elements that use a metal {{layer of the}} CMOS structure. Two different mechanisms that take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>HIL</b> in on-chip antenna design are investigated. First, we implant <b>the</b> <b>HIL</b> below <b>the</b> on-chip dipole antenna {{to act as an}} artificial magnetic conductor (AMC), which enhances the radiation of the dipole. We have obtained 1. 2 dB realized gain for a dipole antenna placed above a 45 dogbone array at 90 GHz. The second use of <b>the</b> <b>HIL</b> is directly as a radiating antenna, without the need of the dipole antenna on top. In this case we have obtained 2 dB accepted gain from a HIL made of 55 dogbone array, fed by two microstrip lines having 180 phase difference. The results are obtained by full-wave simulation. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
