5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still <b>there.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{business}} issues forced Tibbets's family {{to return to}} Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934. During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines. After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only {{a year and a}} half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> party was so messy.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason the}} Raider name was in <b>there</b> is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} Midget AAA hockey team was {{administered by the}} Junior Raiders team.|$|R

25|$|The {{infection}} {{usually has}} its {{origin in the}} vagina and ascends to the Fallopian tube from <b>there.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> infection can spread via the lymph vessels, infection in one Fallopian tube usually leads to infection of the other.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September, Meagher's handbag {{was found}} by police in a laneway near Hope Street, Brunswick. This was close to where she lived. Police were {{suspicious}} as to how {{it came to be}} <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> area had previously been searched by them.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 Shell drilled {{the first}} well off Nova Scotia, the Sable Offshore Energy Project C-67 well. Located on desolate, sandy Sable Island (best {{known for its}} herd of wild horses), the well {{bottomed}} in gas-bearing Cretaceous rocks. Drilling stopped <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> technology did not exist to handle the super-pressures the well encountered.|$|E

25|$|At Bolling Field, he {{was greeted}} by Acting Secretary of State Robert Olds, Mexican Ambassador Miguel Tellez, other dignitaries and spectators. The next day, he had lunch with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge whom hosted the aviator at the Pan American Union. According to the New York Times, the two had to have lunch <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>The</b> White House larder was empty due to the first family's {{impending}} departure for a vacation. While in Washington, he placed a wreath on {{the tomb of the}} unknown soldier.|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{recalled}} {{having to}} work with Gaga on her dancing in the video, and to make her a better dancer she wanted Gaga to be confident. Gaga chose New York to shoot the video because the city is her birthplace. Before shooting started, Gibson and Gaga decided {{there was only one}} place to work on the avant-garde, modern dance routine for the video, Alvin Alley, where Gibson had studied dance. [...] "We rehearsed <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> choreography is really modern-based. It's, like, more technical than anything she's ever done," [...] she recalled. Shooting also took place in Brooklyn for two days. Since Gaga did not want set pictures to be taken before the video was ready, her team had to hide the location and were successful, except at the last day when paparazzi started sneaking around.|$|E
500|$|A {{dichotomy}} {{of musical}} styling {{was featured in}} the album's songs. [...] "Hotel Arizona", [...] "Sunken Treasure", and [...] "Misunderstood" [...] featured personal language and more surrealism compared to alternative country songs such as [...] "The Lonely 1" [...] and [...] "Far, Far Away". To enhance this dichotomy between simple and surreal, each song was practiced, recorded, and mixed in only one day. The album's name {{was taken from the}} 1979 comedy Being <b>There,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> band believed that Peter Sellers' character Chance had an analogous mentality to the mindset of the album. Wilco sought to incorporate influences from other bands, but not to an overbearing degree; however, they were unable to accomplish this with songs like the Rolling Stones-influenced [...] "Monday". Unlike radio-friendly A.M., the band had no preference about whether Being There could yield radio hits.|$|E

50|$|Serra {{was also}} {{present at the}} {{founding}} of the Presidio of Santa Barbara (Santa Barbara, California) on April 21, 1782, but was prevented from locating <b>the</b> mission <b>there</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> animosity of Governor Felipe de Neve.|$|R
500|$|On 23 October, the {{day after}} the broadcast, Griffin {{announced}} he would be lodging a formal complaint over the programme, over its focus on BNP issues rather than topical subjects. Griffin stated, [...] "There is not much support for me <b>there</b> , <b>because</b> <b>the</b> place is dominated by ethnic minorities. There is an ethnic minority that supports me: the English. But there's not many of them left." [...] A spokesman for the BNP said that London was too [...] "multicultural" [...] to be fair to it and that a location like the northwest of England would have been more favourable. The BNP were also going to file a Freedom of Information Request to the BBC to determine the decision-making process behind hosting the programme in London, and in allowing the debate to focus on the BNP, arguing that criticism of the BNP had dominated the whole programme.|$|E
500|$|The party scenes at Jesse's house {{sought to}} {{illustrate}} Jesse's internal guilt and self-hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher {{in the third}} season finale, [...] "Full Measure". Gilligan said these scenes were written {{because he wanted to}} demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences. The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale, and went with the course of events in [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience. Bryan Cranston praised these scenes, saying [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} way to show a person going through a private hell. That everybody suffers, deals with their own personal loss in many different ways." [...] The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> party was so messy. Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse's state of mind, using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep. During one scene when Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together, Badger leans down outside of the shot to take the drugs, then Skinny Pete pops back up in a match cut. The shot was conceived by MacLaren during filming.|$|E
500|$|Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice {{wrote in}} a {{positive}} review that [...] "this [...] pushes right past competent into mostly legitimately enjoyable" [...] but added that [...] "the movie is still dumb as catbutt. It's an honest and accomplished dumbness, however, where the stupidest stuff seems to be <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> movie would be less fun without it." [...] The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy was critical about the film's use of 3D and accurate reflection of the franchise's comic book and cartoon origins, but predicted it would still earn better than its predecessor, [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade of [...] "B-", calling it [...] "well-executed technocratic action fluff" [...] and commented: [...] "In its dehumanized and trivial way, it's a triumph of razor-sharp, hyper-violent style over formulaic substance ... Hollywood has now evolved {{to the point that}} it can deliver these kinds of thrills with maximum brute force and keep the impact so light that the result can still be regarded as a 'harmless' diversion for 14-year-olds." [...] Glen Heath Jr. of Slant Magazine gave it two out of four stars, criticizing the film's [...] "cut-happy style" [...] and plot, but lauding the action sequences and Chu's direction as [...] "poetry in high-speed motion." [...] Writing for Indiewire's The Playlist Blog, Todd Gilchrist gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] and wrote: [...] "As one might expect, there are more than a handful of loose ends once justice has been served, but there’s something to be said for a film which aims to please in a sincere and straightforward way, without attempting to be the biggest ever. 'Retaliation' is no masterpiece, but it’s a movie whose fun doesn’t feel like a four-letter word" ...|$|E
25|$|Theodorus of Cyrene {{proved the}} irrationality of the surds of whole numbers up to 17, but stopped <b>there</b> {{probably}} <b>because</b> <b>the</b> algebra he used couldn't {{be applied to}} the square root of 17.|$|R

2500|$|Cherry {{moved to}} the United Kingdom when she was 14, {{in the midst of}} the punk era, and she remembers finding [...] "her people" [...] there. Cherry had met Tessa Pollitt, Viv Albertine and Ari Up from The Slits earlier as her stepfather, Don Cherry, was touring with them and brought the 15-year-old Neneh along. She and Ari lived in a squat in Battersea. She felt at home, after ending up <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>The</b> Slits invited Don Cherry to go on tour with them with Prince Hammer and Creation Rebel.|$|E
2500|$|Like the piers to it south, its {{historic}} uses were superseded by containerization, {{and it was}} remodeled to house shops and restaurants. Triad Development bought the pier in 1995, and in the late 1990s it was remodeled as a headquarters for Go2Net, which was merged into InfoSpace, and fared poorly in the 2000–2001 crash that followed the dot-com bubble. Immediately before that remodel, in 1998 [...] was filmed <b>there.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> Central Waterfront piers are not zoned residential, the building was officially a 24-hour-a-day film set for the shoot.|$|E

2500|$|Franklin T. [...] "Frank" [...] Wilson, an {{assistant}} professor of criminology at Indiana State University, and a former PhD student at Sam Houston State University, stated that about 2% of the people buried at the Byrd Cemetery had been executed, but the public believes that all executed prisoners are buried <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Huntsville Unit, the site of execution in Texas, is in close proximity. Most executed prisoners are claimed by their families. While most prisoner funerals at Byrd Cemetery are held on Thursdays, in order to allow families of executed prisoners to make a single trip to Huntsville instead of two separate trips, the burial of an executed prisoner not claimed by the family is usually done the day after his or her execution.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, eighteen-year-old Charles Starkweather was {{introduced}} to 13-year-old Caril Ann Fugate by Caril's older sister, whom he had previously dated, but who had chosen to end their relationship. After Caril's sister introduced the two, they continued to talk, even after the relationship of Charles and her sister had ended. Starkweather {{had dropped out of}} Lincoln High School in his senior year and became employed at a Western Union newspaper warehouse. He sought employment <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> warehouse was located near Whittier Junior High School in Lincoln, where Fugate was a student. His employment allowed him to visit her every day after school. Starkweather was considered a poor worker and his employer later recalled, [...] "Sometimes you'd have to tell him something two or three times. Of all the employees in the warehouse, he was the dumbest man we had." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{memories}} of the First Toungoo Empire still loom large not just in Myanmar but also in Thailand and Laos. In Myanmar, Tabinshwehti's and Bayinnaung's exploits are widely recounted in schoolbooks. According to Myint-U, Bayinnaung is the favourite king of the present-day Burmese generals, who often see themselves [...] "as fighting the same enemies {{and in the same}} places... their soldiers slugging their way through the same thick jungle, preparing to torch a town or press-gang villagers. The past closer, more comparable, a way to justify present action. His statues are <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> ordeal of welding a nation together by force is not just history." [...] On {{the opposite side of the}} same token, warrior kings Naresuan of Ayutthaya and Setthathirath of Lan Xang remain the most celebrated kings in Thailand and Laos respectively—Naresuan for returning Siam to independence and Setthathirath for his pesky resistance to the empire.|$|E
50|$|Enoura, {{a coastal}} area of Odawara {{known for its}} {{pristine}} sea, has an abundance of kumamomi, a type of fish which prefers clear and clean water.
