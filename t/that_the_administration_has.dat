25|$|The Review Commission held {{hearings}} on Guam in December 2003 to take testimony of {{survivors of the}} Japanese occupation concerning their wartime and post-war experiences, and in February 2004 it held a conference in Washington, DC, to hear opinions and insights of legal experts {{on a variety of}} war claims-related issues. These efforts eventually culminated in an 82-page written report, with numerous appendices, which the Review Commission submitted on June 9, 2004, to the Secretary of the Interior, the House Committees on Resources and the Judiciary, and the Senate Committees on Energy and Natural Resources and the Judiciary. As provided by law, the Review Commission then went out of existence on July 10, 2004. It is the FCSC's understanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> not taken a position on any of the findings and recommendations contained in the Review Commission's report.|$|E
50|$|Supporters of {{drilling}} in ANWR argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> {{agreed to a}} number of measures to minimize the impact {{of drilling}} on the Arctic environment. For example, roadways would be constructed of ice that would melt in the spring, when activity on the roads would cease. Also, supporters say that the total surface disturbance due to drilling would be limited to not more than 2,000 acres (8 km²).|$|E
5000|$|... "The quashing of the {{complaints}} is an empty victory for the administration. It merely demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> the capacity to deploy the advantages of incumbency to save the president from being unseated. Until the president stands trial where she can defend herself and {{where it can be}} shown that the accusations are false and do not constitute impeachable offenses, {{it would be hard for}} her to regain public confidence and reestablish the legitimacy of her government." ...|$|E
5000|$|The administration's actions {{influenced}} U.S. Steel {{to rescind}} the price increase. The Wall Street Journal wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> acted [...] "by naked power, by threats, by {{agents of the}} state security police." [...] Yale law professor Charles Reich opined in <b>The</b> New Republic <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict U.S. Steel for collusion so quickly.|$|R

5000|$|In sum, {{we remain}} as unpersuaded by the DOJ's 42-page {{attempt to find}} {{authority}} for the NSA spying program as we were of its initial five-page version. The DOJ's more extended discussion only reaffirms our initial conclusion, because it makes clear that to find this program statutorily authorized would requires rewriting not only clear specific federal legislation, but major aspects of constitutional doctrine. Accordingly, we continue to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> failed to offer any plausible legal justification for the NSA program.|$|E
5000|$|As of August 1, Orange Peel for the 2007-2008 {{school year}} has been canceled. Cancelation has been {{attributed}} to the financial insolvency of past events and outstanding debt owed by the University Student Government Association to the University Student Union (Allegedly $300,000). Multiple attempts by student leaders to [...] "bring back Orange Peel" [...] have been dismissed by school administrators as recently as 2013. It is widely believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> little interest in brokering a payment workout given their long standing campaign to discourage events which might encourage the consumption of alcohol.|$|E
5000|$|Critics of {{the bill}} {{expressed}} concern, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> been guided {{by the same people}} who previously lobbied for patent reform on behalf of IBM and Microsoft, and that their appointments were a violation of the Obama Administration's [...] "Revolving Door Ban". USPTO Director David Kappos represented IBM, Marc Berejka (Senior Policy Advisor, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce) lobbied on behalf of Microsoft, and Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, to whom the USPTO reported until Locke was made Ambassador to China on August 1, 2011, also has extensive ties to Microsoft.|$|E
50|$|A senior <b>administration</b> {{official}} said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> assessed {{it likely that}} Abu Sayyaf was {{in direct contact with}} Islamic State leader and self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.|$|R
50|$|A {{large stone}} {{monument}} added in 2013 at the entranceway {{to the campus}} caused controversy when it became apparent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> used approximately $1 million in public funds for its construction and surrounding landscaping.|$|R
50|$|In January 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted}} a performance {{audit of the}} district.

5000|$|But {{perhaps most}} damagingly, Clarke claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> done [...] "a terrible job" [...] {{fighting}} terrorism, even since September 11. In particular, {{he feels the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq played right into Osama bin Laden's hands. For years, bin Laden had been producing propaganda saying that the US wants to invade and occupy an oil-rich middle eastern country, which was essentially validated by the US invasion of Iraq. As a result, says Clarke, it's not surprising that Al-Qaeda and its offshoots are having much greater success recruiting new members.|$|E
5000|$|... "I am not {{convinced}} that giving the President the authority to launch a unilateral, first-strike attack on Iraq is the appropriate course of action at this time. While I believe that under international law and {{under the authority of}} our Constitution, the United States must maintain the option to act in its own self-defense, I strongly believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> not provided evidence of an imminent threat of attack on the United States that would justify a unilateral strike. I also believe that actions alone, without exhausting peaceful options, could seriously harm global support for our war on terrorism and distract our own resources from this cause." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} {{said they will}} provide Rp30 billion, or about US$2.5 million, from the state budget {{for the construction of}} the airfield. In the meantime, Gabriel Asem, the head of Tambrauw district, remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> budgeted Rp9 billion, or about US$752 thousand, for the construction of the airport and Rp3 billion, or about US$250 thousand, for acquiring the land for the airport.The airport needs a land area of 200 hectares, including for its runway, taxiway, and the apron. The area of the runway is 500 x 23 meters, while the runway strip is 520 x 60 meters.The Werur Airport will facilitate the locals and tourists to reach Raja Ampat and other locations in West Papua.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, as {{the economy}} {{continued}} to grow, Kennedy became concerned {{with the issue of}} inflation. He asked companies and unions to work together to keep prices low, and met initial success. Bobby Kennedy took <b>the</b> position <b>that</b> <b>the</b> steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices. The administration's actions influenced U.S. Steel to rescind the price increase. The Wall Street Journal wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> acted [...] "by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police."

50|$|Some {{commentators}} {{and newspaper}} readers {{believed that this}} Washington Post editorial contradicted a news article in the paper's same issue, which reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> misrepresented its actual confidence level in <b>the</b> intelligence reports <b>that</b> Hussein was seeking uranium.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, voices {{were raised in}} defence of the {{institutions}} involved, especially the social services. They argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> simply complied with the procedures and general setup {{for the prevention of}} child abuse, and that it was dangerous to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of the system from a single dramatic case.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in YouthKiAwaaz.com, he writes, [...] "Their hopelessness nonetheless seems reasonable to me, being a product of the same system and realising that the students have reason to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> let them down. But the onus lies with the university administration as much as it does with the schools themselves." [...] Speaking against the Internal Quota, Amartya Sen had remarked, [...] "If our interest lies not in the greater good of the society, if our only concern is limited to the academic opportunism that would benefit our own children, and to this end we employ Quotas, then {{it is safe to say}} that there is a fundamental lack in the thought process".|$|E
50|$|On September 20, 2002, The United Press International {{reported}} that there were:... doubts {{about the quality of}} some of the evidence that the United States is using to make its case that Iraq is trying to build a nuclear bomb emerged Thursday. While National Security Adviser Condi Rice stated on September 8 that imported aluminum tubes 'are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs' a growing number of experts say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> not presented convincing evidence that the tubes were intended for use in uranium enrichment rather than for artillery rocket tubes or other uses. Former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright said he found significant disagreement among scientists within the Department of Energy and other agencies about the certainty of the evidence.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "only {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{cited as}} justifying its proposals" [...] {{is the work}} of economist George Borjas, who has defended the bill, arguing that it [...] "makes sense" [...] and that [...] "low-skill immigration, which would likely suffer the largest cuts in the proposed bill, imposes costs on taxpayers and it imposes costs on low-skill workers already here." [...] Other economists have sharply contested Borjas's conclusions; economist Giovanni Peri stated that [...] "The average American worker is more likely to lose than to gain from immigration restrictions" [...] and [...] "most studies put the negative impact on low-skilled wages closer to zero," [...] and Michael Clemens argues that Borjas's position is based on a study with critical flaws.|$|E
5000|$|In United States House of Representatives v. Price (2016), Judge Collyer {{first found}} the House had {{standing}} to sue <b>the</b> Obama <b>Administration</b> and, then, found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> unconstitutionally spent billions of Treasury funds on health insurer subsidies without a Congressional appropriation. [...] Judge Collyer enjoined any further insurer reimbursements without a valid appropriation, but stayed her order pending appeal.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Lawrence v. Texas that sodomy laws against consenting adults was unconstitutional.

Is {{it any wonder that}} on the subject of Iraq, more and more Americans have little confidence in this Administration? We can not take ANY of this Administration's assertions on Iraq at face value anymore, and no amount of charts or statistics will improve its credibility. This is not a knock on you, General Petraeus, or on you, Ambassador Crocker. But the fact remains, gentlemen, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> sent you here today to convince the members of these two Committees and the Congress that victory is at hand.

50|$|Several days later, Reese {{leaves a}} faculty meeting {{as a result}} of the rest of the faculty's {{attempts}} to put all the blame on Malley for the violence and unrest of the past several weeks. A drunk Fr. Penny talks to him about the boys, telling Reese that he's had a revelation that the boys are clearly possessed. After Fr. Penny goes to bed, Reese gets the urge to deliberately cut his hand on a piece of glass. Dobbs comes storming out of the meeting and talks with Reese while patching up his hand. Reese shows his displeasure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> elected Malley as their scapegoat, and says, much to Dobbs confusion, that there is something else in the school scaring him, even though Malley hasn't been at school in three days. During this conversation a beaten-up Carre is thrown off the balcony in the faculty room, down the stairs, and to Reese and Dobbs, much to the latter's shock.|$|E

5000|$|King {{initially}} expressed [...] "serious reservations" [...] about {{proposals to}} establish the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, but expressed support for President Obama's creation of the monument in 2016, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> made commitments <b>that</b> convinced him that [...] "the benefits of the designation will far outweigh any detriment"; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monument would not hurt Maine's pulp and paper industry, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monument would help diversify the local economy.|$|R
50|$|The {{controversial}} {{dismissal of}} seven U.S. attorneys by the Bush administration's Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2006, and their replacement by interim appointees, led critics to argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> undermined both <b>the</b> {{integrity of the}} Department of Justice and the non-partisan tradition of U.S. Attorneys. Others likened the event to Watergate, referring to it as Gonzales-gate, and members of Congress from both parties called for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.|$|R
5000|$|The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) bill, which authorizes {{funding for}} a variety of projects, {{including}} beach nourishment, clean water, and flood control programs, passed both chambers of Congress, was vetoed by President Bush, but Democratic Party leaders promised to quickly override this veto. “When we override this irresponsible veto, perhaps the president will finally recognize that Congress is an equal branch of government and reconsider his many other reckless veto threats,” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Howard Marlowe of Marlowe & Company Marlowe & Company said, “Water resources are critical to the nation’s economy and international competitiveness. To say this is too expensive {{flies in the face of}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> done nothing over the past seven years to build water resources infrastructure.” [...] "Without a Water Resources Development Act, which is seven years overdue, we are seeing our coastline disappear," [...] said Rep.
