5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} of {{the principle}} of nonviolence, {{he was the first to}} apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Experiments with Truth.|$|E

500|$|Like Madama Butterfly, Pinkerton views Japanese {{culture from}} the {{perspective}} of an outsider who considers Japan fragile and sensual; the album infuses the Japanese allusions with its narrator's romantic disappointments and sexual frustration. Cuomo wrote that Pinkerton [...] "is really the clash of East vs West. My hindu, zen, kyokushin, self-denial, self-abnegation, no-emotion, cool-faced side versus my Italian-American heavy metal side." [...] He stated that [...] "the ten songs are sequenced in the order in which I wrote them (with two minor exceptions). So as a whole, the album kind of tells <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> struggle with my inner Pinkerton." ...|$|E

Thomas asked me if I wanted to tell <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life. Then they would {{know what to do with}} it."

500|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Diana Mandache, Marie {{published}} 34 {{books and}} short stories, both in Romanian and English, during her lifetime. This included her critically acclaimed autobiography, <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Life, published by Cassell in London, in three volumes. The book was reviewed by Virginia Woolf, who felt it was too familiarizing of the royal family. She stated that [...] "suppose that among the autumn books of 2034 is Prometheus Unbound, by George the Sixth, or Wuthering Heights, by Elizabeth the Second, what will be the effect upon their loyal subjects? Will the British Empire survive? Will Buckingham Palace look as solid then as it does now? Words are dangerous things, let us remember. A republic might be brought into being by a poem." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a preview}} of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse {{acknowledged}} the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that [...] "hard rock guitars and percussion come crashing in on the chorus." [...] Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to [...] "Kings and Queens", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described [...] "City of Angels" [...] as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brother and I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land." [...] Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams. Mary Ouellette, writing for Loudwire, felt that the song [...] "tells a passionate tale of finding comfort in calling the city of Los Angeles home." ...|$|E

She added, [...] "It's all about where I'm from and love of theater and love of music and love of the lie in art, and Steven really knows and understands that, [...] So we're making a beautiful video, and I'm so excited." [...] In May 2010, Gaga told The Times about the concept of the video: [...] " [...] purity of my friendships with my gay friends, and how I've been unable to find that with a straight man in my life. It's a celebration and an admiration of gay love—it confesses my envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together. In the video I'm pining for the love of my gay friends—but they just don't want me to be with them." ...|$|E
