5|$|Mick {{encounters}} two vampires who {{are looking}} for Coraline. Once they leave, Mick visits his vampire friend Josef, who tells him that one of them was Lance (Jason Butler Harner), a rich and powerful vampire. Mick finds Coraline at a storage facility working on a compound for the vampire cure. Coraline explains that during the French Revolution there were seven siblings of royal blood who were vampires, two of whom were Lance and Coraline. She then uses the compound to cure Mick's vampirism, although Lance arrives and takes her away. Mick enjoys life as a human, although the cure is only temporary. Beth's boss at BuzzWire is killed, and a new assistant district attorney named Benjamin Talbot (Eric Winter) investigates the murder. Mick and Beth discuss the problems of having a romantic relationship, and although they end up kissing, Mick tells her he needs <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> things out. Photos of Mick getting hit by a vehicle find their way into the hands of Talbot. Mick and Beth decide to start a romantic relationship, and go to a restaurant for their first date. When Beth quits her job at BuzzWire and becomes unemployed, Talbot offers her a job as a civilian investigator. Talbot receives a list of names of all the vampires in the area, including Mick, from an unknown source. Beth tells Mick that she cannot continue to date him because of their vampire-human situation, but Mick says that he loves her and they kiss.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulty}} of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for encrypting messages (e.g., RSA) depend on functions {{that are known}} to all, but whose inverses (a) are known only to a chosen few, and (b) would take one too long a <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays {{are based on the}} {{difficulty of}} a few number-theoretical problems.|$|E

500|$|By early 1989, {{the title}} of Mr. Wiggles had been retired as the band {{switched}} to the intentionally risqu√© [...] " [...] Daddies". Derived from a jive phrase the band had heard on a vintage race record, the name intended to reflect the group's jazz and blues influences {{as well as an}} edgy punk irreverence in the same vein as the Butthole Surfers, though the decision was ultimately made on impulse, as the members had run out of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out a name to put on their posters and doubted their longevity past a handful of shows. The band played their first show as the Cherry Poppin' Daddies at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall on March 31, 1989.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode to be written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, [...] "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> {{out how to get}} away from the life he was living, and I think a lot of people feel like that." [...] In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.|$|E

He said Linkin Park was still making a concept record, stating in another interview with MTV, [...] "we might need to just make a record and still try to do a concept but {{figure out a way}} to do it without actually waiting another five or six years to put out a record, to try to pull off all the grandiose insanity we were thinking of doing. And we're doing that." [...] Bassist Dave [...] "Phoenix" [...] Farrell predicted the band's fans would be divided about A Thousand Suns, saying, [...] "We've known [...] going to be different, and if fans were expecting Hybrid Theory or Meteora, they're going to be surprised.

500|$|A year later, {{the option}} {{on the book}} became {{available}} and was purchased by Aaron Ryder of Newmarket Films. In late 2001, Nolan became busy with the post-production of Insomnia, and asked his brother Jonathan to help work on the script. The writing process was a long collaboration between the Nolan brothers, occurring intermittently {{over a period of}} five years. In the script, the Nolans emphasized the magic of the story through the dramatic narrative, playing down the visual depiction of stage magic. The three-act screenplay was deliberately structured around the three elements of the film's illusion: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. [...] "It took a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out how to achieve cinematic versions of the very literary devices that drive the intrigue of the story," [...] Christopher Nolan told Variety: [...] "The shifting points of view, the idea of journals within journals and stories within stories. Finding the cinematic equivalents of those literary devices was very complex." [...] Although the film is thematically faithful to the novel, two major changes were made to the plot structure during the adaptation process: the novel's spiritualism subplot was removed, and the modern-day frame story was replaced with Borden's wait for the gallows. Priest approved of the adaptation, describing it as [...] "an extraordinary and brilliant script, a fascinating adaptation of my novel." ...|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking. [...] But the people who worked with her every day viewed her differently; her exercise rider in 2013, David Nuesch, described her as [...] "straightforward", explaining, [...] "she kind of likes it to be her idea and doesn't want to be told too much what to do." [...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She‚Äôs actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She‚Äôs not quirky because she‚Äôs worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she‚Äôs tougher than you." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{some time}} {{developing}} demos, the musicians returned to Henson in March 2012, recording seven songs before the band {{decided to take}} a break, as according to guitarist Mike McCready [...] "we had to take some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what we wanted to do." [...] Guitarist Stone Gossard added that despite the bandmembers thinking that after the productive sessions the album was nearing completion, eventually they considered the tracks [...] "didn‚Äôt feel strong enough for a record. Work on the album resumed only in March 2013 as the bandmembers regrouped with new compositions, mostly done separatedly in each member's home studio‚Äîthough McCready at times worked along with drummer Matt Cameron‚Äîbefore the group reunited to finish the songs together. O'Brien attributed the long break to the band's busy schedule, as the musicians got into side projects after putting the Pearl Jam album on hold: singer Eddie Vedder started a solo tour, drummer Matt Cameron returned to Soundgarden, guitarist Stone Gossard rejoined side project Brad, Ament recorded solo album While My Heart Beats and started the project RNDM, and McCready formed the group Walking Papers while also taking part in a partial reunion of Mad Season. Vedder still considered that all the diversions helped Pearl Jam to have [...] "more importance placed on the records" [...] and focusing on making the best album possible. Like with previous records the songs had their first recordings with all the musicians playing together, though O'Brien added that with Lightning Bolt [...] "we don‚Äôt keep as much of [...] as we used to." [...] Guest musicians include O'Brien himself at the keyboards, long time keyboardist Boom Gaspar, and violinist Ann Marie Calhoun. After six weeks of new recording sessions, the album was mixed in Seattle at the band's desire, with the process taking place in Studio X.|$|E

2500|$|Yellowcard {{announced}} {{in an interview}} in April 2008 that the group would be going on an [...] "indefinite hiatus." [...] The band's European tour set for 2008 was canceled, and they instead embarked on an acoustic tour in the spring of 2008 before going on hiatus. Among the reasons for the band's hiatus were individual member situations. Longineu Parsons took some time off in the winter to spend time with family and joined a side project band based in Jacksonville, Florida. Sean Mackin got married in 2008 and wanted to take some time off to spend with his family. Ryan Key stated that the members needed some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out their personal lives. The band members were unsure of the hiatus' length, but they assured their fans they planned to return as a group. In May 2008, Yellowcard left Capitol Records and was left unsigned. On June 16, 2009, Capitol released an EP titled Deep Cuts, which consists of four previously released tracks.|$|E

2500|$|Later in 1990, Alexandru Stefu (another {{old friend}} from Romania) invited ComƒÉneci and Panait to Montreal, {{where he was}} staying {{with his family and}} B√©la K√°rolyi.

Lately I have been nursing in Chicago, where I am better known than in New York and can get better wages. Since my return from Italy I've been saving to renew the search for Jason Jones. While nursing a Mrs. Tolliver at the Hotel Blackington, fortune suddenly smiled on me. I chanced to examine the hotel register last night and found you were registered with Colonel Hathaway's party. Your room number was marked opposite your name, so I had you properly located.
