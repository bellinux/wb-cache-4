25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and <b>thermal</b> <b>cover.</b> Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of prairie dog burrows provide {{the greatest amount of}} cover for black-footed ferrets. Black-tailed prairie dog colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed prairie dog colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of prairie dog burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed prairie dog burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded prairie dog burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|E

50|$|Snowshoe hares require dense, brushy, usually {{coniferous}} cover; thermal {{and escape}} cover are {{especially important for}} young hares. Low brush provides hiding, escape, and <b>thermal</b> <b>cover.</b> Heavy cover 10 feet (3 m) above ground provides protection from avian predators, and heavy cover 3.3 feet (1 m) tall provides cover from terrestrial predators. Overwinter survival increases with increased cover. A wide variety of habitat types are used if cover is available. Base visibility in good snowshoe hare habitat ranges from 2% at 16.5 feet (5 m) distance to 0% at 66 feet (20 m). Travel cover is slightly more open, ranging from 14.7% visibility at 16.5 feet (5 m) to 2.6% at 66 feet (20 m). Areas with horizontal vegetation density of 40 to 100% at 50 feet (15 m) are adequate snowshoe hare habitat in Utah.|$|E

50|$|Daily {{movements}} {{by individual}} mountain goats are primarily confined to {{areas on the}} same mountain face, drainage basin, or alpine opening. Daily movements reflect an individual’s needs for foraging, resting, thermoregulation and security from predators or disturbance. Seasonal movements primarily reflect nutritional needs (e.g., movements to and from mineral licks/salt lick), reproductive needs (i.e., movement of pre-parturient females to “kidding” areas; movement to rutting areas), and climatic influences (i.e., movement to areas in response to foraging conditions). In general, seasonal movements are likely to exhibit a strong elevational component, whereby lower, forested elevations are used during the spring-summer (security cover effects) to access lower elevation mineral licks, and during winter (<b>thermal</b> <b>cover</b> effects) to access forage. The farthest movements {{are expected to be}} by dispersing mountain goats. Such movements are likely to involve mountain goats crossing forested valleys as they move between mountain blocks.|$|E
50|$|A teapot is {{a vessel}} used for {{steeping}} tea leaves or an herbal mix in boiling or near-boiling water, and for serving the resulting infusion {{which is called}} tea. Dry tea is available either in tea bags or as loose tea, in which case a tea infuser or tea strainer may be of some assistance, either to hold the leaves as they steep or to catch the leaves inside the teapot when the tea is poured. Teapots usually have an opening with a lid at their top, where the dry tea and hot water are added, a handle for holding by hand and a spout through which the tea is served. Some teapots have a strainer built-in on the inner edge of the spout. A small air hole in the lid is often created to stop the spout from dripping and splashing when tea is poured. In modern times, a <b>thermal</b> <b>cover</b> called a tea cosy {{may be used to}} enhance the steeping process or to prevent the contents of the teapot from cooling too rapidly.|$|E

40|$|During recent years, much {{attention}} has been paid to the analysis of fire effect on steel structures because of fire importance and its effect on the stability of steel structures.

To do so and taking into account the high costs of lab tests and their limitations in investigation of numerous parameters during any test, finite element method is used as a powerful and valuable tool in modeling of steel frames under thermal conditions. In this study, the fire effect on steel beams is studied considering the softening of connection and decrease of materials strength. Then, structure durability in fire will be analyzed in the ANSYS software. The analyzed frame is a single span three dimensional one and different conditions including connection type, longitudinal expansion effect, thermal loading and the kind of fire will be analyzed and compared.

In late 2010, the tank squadron added five of the new Leopard 2A4Ms. The tank squadron operated with the three different Leopards until it was pulled from combat operations. The C-2 MEXAS with the mine ploughs, mine rollers and the dozers were used alongside the Leopard 2's, until a bracket was installed for the Leopard 2A6M to mount them.|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{focuses on}} the introduction of <b>thermal</b> <b>cover</b> factors and {{the assessment of the}}ir interaction with the electrical cover factors. Cover factors are used to quantify the mismatch or non-simultaneity of local production and consumption of electricity and heat. First, the electrical cover factors are redefined to include the losses related to the storage of electricity and other inherent losses. Thereafter, similar <b>thermal</b> <b>cover</b> factors are defined. This allows the assessment of the self-consumption and self-generation for locally generated heat by means of e. g. heat pumps. In this paper, a case study focuses on a net-zero energy building. Net- zero energy buildings require an increase in distributed energy resources (e. g. photovoltaic systems). To minimize the impact of the resulting bidirectional power flows on the distribution grid, demand side management and storage (thermal and electrical) are often mentioned as solutions; i. e. increasing the self-consumption of locally produced electricity. The building in this case study is heated by means of a heat pump.
