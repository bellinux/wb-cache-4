No change in the mechanism of decomposition was observed {{as a result of}} γ-irradiation, whereas an increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic values of the decomposition was recorded for pre-γ-irradiated samples. Addition of cross-linking agents to the carbon black modified rubber has significant effect on the kinetics values of thermal decomposition for the pre-γ-irradiated carbon-black modified rubber.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel model-based {{algorithm}} which finds the 3 D pose {{of an object}} from an image by breaking down the estimation process into two linear processing stages, namely the depth approximation and the pose calculation. The depth approximation stage determines the new positions of the model point set in 3 D space whereas the pose calculation step is a least-square estimation of the transformation parameters between the point set formed from the previous stage and the model set. The estimates are iteratively refined until converged. The advantage of using our algorithm is that, by splitting the nonlinear estimation problem into two linear steps, the computational cost is much reduced. We also perform an error analysis that demonstrates the capabilityaswell as limitations of the algorithm in this paper. We test our algorithm by applying it to a real time head tracking problem with satisfactory results. index : Pose Estimation, Real time vision, Human-computer Interface. S. H. Or, K. H. Wong and I.

40|$|Reliability of {{audience}} measurement reports {{both from the}} perspective of viewers and competitive relations between broadcasters have been of concern to the Regulators in most countries. Internationally, countries have largely come up with self-governing, not-for-profit institutions drawing membership from both advertisers and broadcasters that are responsible for, inter- alia, administering a reliable system of accreditation for broadcast audience measurement services. Ratings agencies are not allowed to be members of such bodies. Should this model be followed in our country as well; should there be an oversight body or should the TRP ratings and rating agencies be governed by some Standards prescribed and monitored by the regulating bodies? This consultation paper raises these issues and others relating to policy framework surrounding the TRP ratings and ratings agencies. The stakeholders are requested to send their comments and views preferably in the electronic form on the various issues mentioned in the paper by 21 April 2008.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} aimed at semi-quantifying the {{membrane}} density of multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) transporters in Chironomidae Orthocladiinae larvae from an urban stream by ELISA assay. The relationships between the MXR transporter membrane density and limnological parameters and pollutant concentrations, 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as per the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and seven polychlorobiphenyl congeners (PCBs), were assessed. Midge larvae were collected, and limnological parameters and pollutant concentrations were measured in three sites of a French Mediterranean urban stream, two located after sewage treatment plants, and one closed to the river mouth, and in two additional sites, one on the stream tributary, and one in a non-urbanized stream located in the same region. Results show that the PAH and PCB contamination levels are different between sites and that some congener concentrations are above their threshold toxic effect level (TEL). The MXR transporter membrane density was significantly higher in larvae from the tributary, the most polluted site, as compared with larvae from the non-urbanized stream. The MXR transporter density {{was positively correlated with}} 10 of the 16 US-EPA PAH concentrations and the increase in the MXR transporter density seems to be due to the US-EPA PAH concentrations that were above their <b>TEL.</b> <b>No</b> relations with PCB concentrations or limnological parameters were found.

In October 2010 Israel's Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov encouraged Israelis to boycott Turkey as a vacation spot in response to Turkey's stance on Gaza. The number of Israeli tourists in Turkey dropped to 300,000 in 2009 and to 110,000 in 2010; it declined further to about 62,000 between January and August 2011.
