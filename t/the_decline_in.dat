The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E

Our study suggests that <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national HIV prevalence {{in some of the}} SSA countries may not be representative of downward trends in prevalence in areas of high HIV prevalence, as much as the result of sharp <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> prevalence in areas of already low HIV prevalence.

40|$|This {{study has}} two main objectives. First, it {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which <b>the</b> <b>declined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market capitalization below the book values of the net assets represents an appropriate proxy for an indication that goodwill may be impaired by listed companies in Malaysia, as an example of listed companies in an emerging market. Using the findings from the first research objective, this study explores cases of late reporting of goodwill impairment losses. Results show that as a stand-alone, <b>the</b> <b>declined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market capitalization is not an ideal proxy for an indication that goodwill may be impaired, as it does not fully reflect the condition of the cash-generating-units containing goodwill, disclosed in the Notes to the financial statement. However, when <b>the</b> <b>declined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market capitalization is examined in relation to financial performance of companies and their segment results, it becomes a useful starting point in identifying cases of late reporting of goodwill impairment losses. The study provides important implications for policy makers and relevant authorities, in that, to enhance the quality of financial reporting, the relevant authorities need to closely monitor the disclosure of goodwill impairment by listed companies in the emerging market of Malaysia...|$|R
5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional factor in <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> huia numbers – introduction {{of these animals}} by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E

5|$|Some species {{including}} honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies.

5|$|The Hoops' defeat to Shelbourne in {{the first}} round of the FAI Cup in 1970, their first defeat in 32 Cup games over seven years, marked the start of <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the {{fortunes}} of the club. Despite only narrowly missing out on the League title in the 1970–71 season in controversial circumstances, the next twelve years proved to be a disaster for the club both on and off the field. On 25 April 1971, Rovers met Cork Hibs in Dalymount in a League play-off watched by 28,000 people. Their pre-match buildup was thrown into disarray when players and directors clashed over win bonuses. Hibs won the play-off 3–1. The next season, the Cunninghams, now under the control of sons Arthur and Des, sold the club to three brothers from Dublin; Paddy, Barton and Louis Kilcoyne. The Kilcoynes had witnessed decades of huge attendances at Irish football games and sought to take over the club primarily for business reasons. However, within the space of five years, the large crowds disappeared from Irish football stadia and combined with the demise of Drumcondra and Cork Hibs, <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> fortunes of a number of top clubs and the lack of action by the FAI, the League of Ireland was plunged into a drastic decline.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> C. graminis {{is likely}} to be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction.

Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the {{erection}} of stelae {{is linked}} to <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the institution of divine kingship, {{which began in the}} Late Preclassic. Originally the stelae depicted the king with symbols of power, sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir. By the Terminal Classic, kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords, who also played a prominent role in the events depicted. This reflected a decentralisation of power and the bargaining between high-ranking nobles so that the king could maintain power, but led to a progressive weakening of the king's rule. As the position of the king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger, the latter began to erect their own stelae, a function that was formerly the exclusive preserve of the king himself. Some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states, but even this did not last and they also ceased to erect monuments.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the conquest on {{the lower levels of}} English society is {{difficult}} to assess. The major change was the elimination of slavery in England, which had disappeared {{by the middle of the}} 12th century. There were about 28,000 slaves listed in Domesday Book in 1086, fewer than had been enumerated for 1066. In some places, such as Essex, <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> slaves was 20 per cent for the 20 years. The main reasons for <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> slaveholding appear to have been the disapproval of the Church and the cost of supporting slaves, who unlike serfs, had to be maintained entirely by their owners. The practice of slavery was not outlawed, and the Leges Henrici Primi from the reign of King Henry I continue to mention slaveholding as legal.|$|E
