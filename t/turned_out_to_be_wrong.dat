25|$|In 1985, after {{experiencing}} severe {{fatigue and}} suffering from {{pain in her}} upper legs {{on the set of}} Haunted Honeymoon in the United Kingdom, Radner sought medical treatment. For a period of 10 months, various doctors, most of them in Los Angeles, gave her several diagnoses that all <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> as she continued to experience pain.|$|E
25|$|Despite Thi's good {{relations}} with the Buddhists in his area, most notably the leading activist monk Thích Trí Quang, Kỳ reportedly had the monk's support for Thi's removal. If Kỳ thought that Thích Trí Quang would not organize demonstrations against Thi's dismissal, he <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> as the monk used to crisis to highlight Buddhist calls for civilian rule. There were claims that Thích Trí Quang had always intended to challenge Kỳ, {{regardless of whether or not}} Thi had been cast aside.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, John Nuckolls {{outlined}} {{the idea of}} ignition. This is a fusion chain reaction. Hot helium made during fusion reheats the fuel and starts more reactions. John argued that ignition would require lasers of about 1kJ. This <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> Nuckolls's paper started a major development effort. Several laser systems were built at LLNL. These included the argus, the Cyclops, the Janus, the long path, the Shiva laser and the Nova in 1984. This prompted the UK to build the Central Laser Facility in 1976.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{differences}} over {{the quality of}} the film, critics were in agreement that the film had drawn attention to von Stauffenberg's cause. It was applauded [...] "both as a history lesson and as a film". Tobias Kniebe of the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as [...] "maybe not the masterpiece we might have dreamed of ... but not much less", a sentiment shared by many German critics. The public-service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie [...] "neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century.... Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film." [...] The newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger reported that any fear that the [...] "myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter has <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> and prejudicial".|$|E
2500|$|He {{reported}} on initial modeling estimates that forecast impacts extending to south Asia, {{and perhaps to}} the northern hemisphere as well. Singer, on the other hand, said that calculations showed that the smoke would go to an altitude of about [...] and then be rained out after about {{three to five days}} and thus the lifetime of the smoke would be limited. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general, lofting to about [...] and a few times as high as [...]|$|E

50|$|This {{elaborate}} trick-photography sequence <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> only a dream when Joe Roberts rouses Keaton from bed. The bedroom then <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not a bedroom, but a {{set on a}} stage.|$|R
2500|$|Sagan listed {{modeling}} {{outcomes that}} forecast effects extending to South Asia, {{and perhaps to}} the Northern Hemisphere as well. Sagan stressed this outcome was so likely that [...] "It should affect the war plans."

2500|$|In 1994 a [...] (PUA) (parliamentary {{commission}} of enquiry) was installed after {{the resignation of}} the State Minister for the Interior Werner Hackmann, because of several accusations of xenophobia, with assaults and alleged police brutality. The commission was in existence for over two years— the longest term in Hamburg's history to date. In 1996 the findings stated that right wing extremist events in the police were no individual cases. During the investigations, State Police Colonel Heinz Krappen resigned too, but some accusations <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> The whole incident is known as Hamburg police scandal, and a police complaints authority— to investigate independent and unprejudiced, and to break the [...] "wall of silence", which was often noticed during investigations within the police— was installed in 1998, but dissolved by Senator Ronald Schill in 2001.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, repeats were {{observed}} in the archaeal organisms of Haloferax and Haloarcula species, and their function was studied by Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain. [...] Although his hypothesis <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> Mojica surmised {{at the time that}} the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in Haloferax volcanii. [...] Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time. [...] By 2000, Mojica's group had identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes. [...] In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who was searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.|$|E

6000|$|... "Who says?" [...] {{interrupted}} Mrs Dotropy; [...] "who are `they' who say so many {{stupid things}} {{that every one}} seems bound to believe? Joy does kill, sometimes. Besides, what if you <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> and raised hopes that were only destined to be crushed?

I set my face firmly against anything of the sort." ...|$|E
60|$|This was a pleasant, companionable little man, {{with the}} drawback, however, I must own, {{of being too}} fond, in season and out of season, of his joke, and of his {{plunging}} in rather a headlong manner into talk with strangers, without waiting to feel his way first. In society he was constantly making mistakes, and setting people unintentionally by the ears together. In his medical practice he was a more prudent man; picking up his discretion (as his enemies said) {{by a kind of}} instinct, and proving to be generally right where more carefully conducted doctors <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{first story}} arc, Armor Plated, was about Blue Beetle battling several robots that were attacking El Paso.

50|$|The accusations {{made against}} him <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> On February 2, 1998, ADQ Leader Mario Dumont offered a public apology for having made a rushed {{decision}} concerning Guitouni.|$|E

30|$|These {{possibilities}} {{have emerged}} as our classical concept of hydrolases will <b>be</b> always hydrolases <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not absolutely valid.

50|$|Later leads have <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead ends.

50|$|The design also <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsatisfactory. The {{network of}} {{corridors}} was so labyrinthine {{that even the}} warders got lost; and the ventilation system allowed sound to carry, so that prisoners could communicate between cells. The annual running costs <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an unsupportable £16,000.|$|R
50|$|Mr Jones was a Royal Mail driver. He became {{diabetic}} and insulin {{dependent and}} {{was removed from}} driving duties. The Post had done their own medical appraisal, which <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> He alleged that his dismissal was unfair.|$|E
50|$|The dinosaur Coelophysis {{was once}} {{suspected}} to practice {{this form of}} cannibalism but this <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> although Deinonychus may have done.

50|$|These words {{subsequently}} <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> In {{spite of}} careful watch, Diomedes managed {{to launch an}} attack upon the sleeping Trojans.

6000|$|... "Not much," [...] {{answered}} {{the real estate}} dealer's son. [...] "The police thought they had one or two clues, but they have all <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> false.

5000|$|Over time, some began <b>to</b> {{suspect it}} <b>was</b> a hoax. Mike and Diane looked older than 18 and {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> actors.
