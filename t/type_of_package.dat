50|$|One of {{the issues}} with the CSP <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> (which was {{intended}} to be soldered directly to an FR4 or flex circuit) was that for high-density interconnects, the soft solder bump provided less of a stand-off as the solder bump diameter and pitch were decreased. Different solutions were employed including one developed by Focus Interconnect Technology (former APTOS engineers), which used a high aspect ratio plated copper post to provide a larger fixed standoff than was possible for a soft solder collapse joint.|$|E
5000|$|The TO-220 {{package is}} a [...] "power package" [...] {{intended}} for power semiconductors and {{an example of}} a through-hole design rather than a surface-mount technology <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package.</b> TO-220 packages can be mounted to a heat sink to dissipate several watts of waste heat.

Thermal compound is often applied to further improve heat transfer from the package to the heatsink.|$|E
50|$|When {{selecting}} packaging films (web substrates) for EMAP {{of fruits}} and vegetables the main characteristics to consider are gas permeability, water vapour transmission rate, mechanical properties, transparency, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> and sealing reliability. Traditionally used packaging films like LDPE (low-density polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) and OPP (oriented polypropylene) are not permeable enough for highly respiring products like fresh-cut produce, mushrooms and broccoli. As fruits and vegetables are respiring products, {{there is a need to}} transmit gases through the film. Films designed with these properties are called permeable films. Other films, called barrier films, are designed to prevent the exchange of gases and are mainly used with non-respiring products like meat and fish.|$|E

50|$|Once {{a coffee}} bean is roasted, {{it is either}} {{packaged}} immediately for sale, or ground and then packaged for sale. Packages used are typically either an airtight plastic container or vacuum-sealed wrapping, or a folded-over bag with a pressure relief valve. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> has its own advantages. The airtight containers allow maximum freshness of the bean and prolong its shelf life, whilst the valve allows excess carbon dioxide, and other gases to escape. The carbon dioxide, as much as 10 L/kg of coffee for dark-roasted coffee, is not released because it is harmful to the flavour—quite the contrary, it protects the beans against oxidation, but excess pressure could damage the container. Reported experience is that {{a few days of}} carbon dioxide release is needed between roasting and brewing for best results. There is also informed opinion that storage of freshly roasted beans in a can pressurized with nitrogen gas, with excess pressure buildup vented via a relief valve, provides optimal storage for extended periods, while promoting a beneficial aging effect related to distribution of natural oils by the pressure.|$|E

50|$|PVC {{packaging}} A {{more recent}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> that is common {{as of the}} 2000s decade is PVC <b>packaging.</b> With this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging,</b> the cardboard card {{is replaced by a}} clear PVC plastic backing. The front <b>of</b> the <b>package</b> is a different piece of PVC plastic that is molded to include a bubble that will house the action figure and all of its accessories. Any colorful artwork designed to help draw attention to the package will be printed on a thin piece of paper that is placed between these two pieces of PVC, or will be affixed in sticker form to the front piece <b>of</b> PVC. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> is popular today and can be seen being used by McFarlane Toys for their Movie Maniacs line of action figures beginning with Series V. Other companies that utilize this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> are NECA/Reel Toys (National Entertainment Collectibles Association) with their Cult Classics and Pirates of the Caribbean line of figures, and Toy Biz with its Marvel Legends action figures, which included a comic book placed between the two PVC segments.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} different factors on some {{physical and chemical properties}} of nuts. The factors evaluated were {{the presence or absence of}} the inner skin, geographical origin, storage conditions (ambient temperature, in a stove at 30 and 50 °C, in a chamber at 30 and 50 °C and 90 % RH, refrigerated and freezing) and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> (none, low density polyethylene and low density polyethylene). The fruits studied were almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts from different countries. The properties measured were moisture content, water activity, colour coordinates (L*, a* and b*) and texture parameters (hardness and friability). Experimental data were modelled using neural networks. The results showed that the almonds from Spain and Romania had aw greater than 0. 6, and therefore, its stability was not guaranteed, contrarily to the other samples that presented values of aw lower than 0. 6. The colour coordinate lightness varied from 40. 60 to 49. 30 in the fresh samples but decreased during storage, indicating darkening. In general, an increase in hardness and friability was observed with the different storage conditions. Neuron weight analysis has shown that the origin was a good predictor for moisture content and texture; whereas, the storage condition was a good predictor for aw and colour. In conclusion, it was possible to verify that the properties of nuts are very different depending on origin; they are better preserved at lower temperatures and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> used did not impact the properties studied...|$|E
40|$|Nonfat dry milk (NOM) was {{evaluated}} {{to determine the}} effect of long term storage on its sensory quality, its solubility index and on the development of oxidative derivatives of sterols. Storage variables included the form of the milk, the atmosphere in the storage container, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> and the storage temperature. A trained taste panel evaluated the milk for the development of cooked, metallic, and oxidized/stale flavors, mouthfeel and overall acceptability. Gas chromatography was used to determine cholesterol content and the quantity of oxidative derivatives of cholesterol present in the samples. Although long term storage of NOM did not affect the solubility index of the milk, the sensory quality of the milk was affected. Over time storage temperature and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> had the greatest effect on sensory quality. Milk stored for 30 months at 32 C developed an unacceptable oxidized/stale flavor and at 42 months of storage, milk stored in polybags at 21 C had also developed an oxidized/stale flavor. These results substantiate the importance of controlling storage conditions during long term storage of NOM. NOM stored for four years did not develop harmful quantities of oxidative derivatives of cholesterol. However, certain expected results did occur. NOM stored in polybags developed more oxidative derivatives than samples stored in cans. Samples stored at 32 C developed more oxidative derivatives of cholesterol than any other sample analyzed and 7 S-hydroxycholesterol, the only known cytotoxic derivative of cholesterol identified, was present in the samples stored at 32 C. Fresh and control samples of NOM contained similar quantities of oxidative derivatives of cholesterol...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{dehydrated}} products {{is a concern}} because, due to their very low moisture content, they tend to rehydrate quite easily, thus compromising the chemical, enzymatic or microbial stabilities, {{as well as the}} nutritional and sensorial properties. Having this in mind, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of storage in walnuts, under certain conditions of temperature, relative humidity and different types of packaging. The fruit samples used were from Chile, Portugal, Romania and United States. The storage of the walnuts lasted for 90 days, and the conditions tested were: room temperature; a stove at 30 and 50 °C without control over relative humidity of the air; refrigeration and freezing. The two types of plastic package tested were low density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). The water activity was measured by a hygrometer; moisture content by oven drying until constant weight and colour with a colorimeter. From the results obtained it was concluded that the samples from the different origins are different with respect to moisture content, water activity and colour, regardless of the storage conditions and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package.</b> Furthermore, it was verified that to assure the good preservation of the walnuts the storage at 50 ºC should be avoided, since it caused an extensive dehydration of the product and a high change in colour in comparison to the unstored samples. Finally, regarding the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package,</b> it was observed that the use of plastic bags did not really improve the products characteristic in relation to the unpacked samples...|$|E
