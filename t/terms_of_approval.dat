His friend Cuitcatl and his promised bride were prisoners in Mexico, and he fought now to deliver them. It was nearly a year from the time when he had first retreated along the fatal causeway; and in that time his frame had broadened out, and his strength increased; and so terrible were the blows he dealt that Cortez, himself, had several times spoken to him in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of his valor, and had appointed him to be one of his own bodyguard.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and marketing of}} agricultural biotechnology applications has led to controversies over whether and how to regulate this new technology. The European Union has imposed severe restrictions on agricultural biotechnology, particularly in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> and labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food. The United States has maintained a far more permissive approval policy and has not required labeling. This article explains these differences {{in terms of the}} collective action capacity of consumer and producer interests and the institutional environment in which regulation has taken place. We find that the regulatory outcome in the EU {{can be traced back to}} NGOs ' increased collective action capacity due to public outrage, an institutional environment favorable to biotech-critical NGO interests (multilevel regulatory policy-making), and a disintegration of the producer coalition due to NGO campaigns and differences in industrial structure. U. S. biotechnology politics has been dominated by a strong and cohesive coalition of pro-biotech up- and downstream producers and farmers. Because of lower public outrage and a less favorable institutional environment (centralized regulatory policy-making), biotech-critical NGOs in the U. S. have been largely excluded from agri-biotech policy-making. ...|$|E
30|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} are a {{very attractive}} market segment to target due to the potential for significantly higher prices and gross margins. Companies like Myriad, Genomic Health or PathGen Diagnostics have developed innovative molecular diagnostics despite the risk that comes along with such developments in terms of development, approval, rates of provider adoption, sales prices or time-to-payer coverage. Since these risks are often underestimated, the (micro-) economics of molecular diagnostic companies that launched products vary significantly. The most important factors in this market are the rate of payer adoption and the time that is needed for approval. In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> by the FDA, a 510 (k) approval may be sufficient for diagnostics that are prognostic indicators. Though, if a test directly influences clinical decision-making {{to go for a}} specific therapy, the FDA very likely will ask for a premarket approval that further increases the time to market significantly. In the present market and regulatory environment, molecular diagnostic companies therefore face challenging economics. However, as personalized medicine is progressing and evolving fast, more diagnostic tests will become available with developers, clinicians, patients, regulators and payers gaining more experience in this field. This in turn will likely influence and speed up the approval processes, and introduce better transparency.|$|E
40|$|Transgenic {{mosquitoes}} {{are being}} developed as novel components of area-wide approaches to vector-borne disease control. Best practice is to develop these in phases, beginning with laboratory studies, before moving to field testing and inclusion in control programs, to ensure safety and prevent costly field testing of unsuitable strains. The process of identifying and developing good candidate strains requires maintenance of transgenic colonies over many generations in containment facilities. By working in disease endemic countries with target vector populations, laboratory strains may be developed and selected for properties that will enhance intended control efficacy in the next phase, while avoiding traits that introduce unnecessary risks. Candidate strains aiming toward field use must consistently achieve established performance criteria, throughout the process of scaling up from small study colonies to production of sufficient numbers for field testing and possible open release. Maintenance of a consistent quality can be demonstrated {{by a set of}} insect quality and insectary operating indicators, measured over time at predetermined intervals. These indicators: inform comparability of studies using various candidate strains at different times and locations; provide evidence of conformity relevant to compliance with <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> for regulated use; and can be used to validate some assumptions related to risk assessments covering the contained phase and for release into the environment...|$|E

40|$|The EC {{harmonized}} {{market entry}} regulation for pharmaceuticals {{from the early}} sixties on, but it achieved neither its goal of uniform national regulatory decisions nor that of automatic mutual recognition. Subsequent attempts to Europeanize the procedures themselves resulted in two alternatives in 1995 : a Centralized Procedure for innovative pharmaceutical products implemented at the EU level, and a Decentralized Procedure which tries to assure mutual recognition. First, the paper analyzes the distinctive modes of Europeanization employed in these regulatory alternatives, examining both {{their impact on the}} effectiveness of European governing and the balance they strike between European interventionism, national participation and national autonomy. Second, it tries to assess whether Europeanization furthers the goals of pharmaceutical market entry policy as defined in European regulations – public health protection, creation of a single market and the reduction of regulatory costs to industry. There is little evidence that the public’s health is less well protected when regulation is Europeanized. Only the Centralized Procedure contributes significantly to the goal of establishing a single market. Regulatory costs in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> time did go down especially for pharmaceutical firms using the Centralized Procedure, mainly because of efficiency-enhancing legal provisions and institutionally induced regulatory competition between national authorities...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{an internal}} debate between Gogodala villagers, Western Province, Papua New Guinea, {{in which they}} explore the concept of development through a dialogue that revolves around ela gi or ‘way of life’. The analysis focuses on two developmental projects: the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine, which affects eight Gogodala villages on the lower Fly River, and a test oil drill carried out among northern Gogodala villages in 1995. I propose that it is through ela gi, a lifestyle that encompasses an evangelical Christianity {{as well as the}} actions of the first ancestors and is based on a bodily experience of the environment, that community development is envisaged and debated. Whilst the oil drill in the north is discussed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval,</b> villagers on the Fly River to the south are increasingly concerned about changes to their lifestyle and landscape. They explore this ambivalence through a discussion of the movements and moods of ancestrally-derived ‘monsters’ or ugu lopala, creatures who patrol the waterways of both north and south villages. At the same time, Gogodala from both communities are articulating what the transition from ‘living on sago’ to a lifestyle based on money might mean. This dialogue foregrounds an ongoing debate about the roles that the environment, village practices, the ancestral past and Christianity play in the constitution of the Gogodala way of life, and how these factors may initiate a certain kind of development.

40|$|European Communities No. L 181 of 9 th July (ISBN 011 916 0927). The {{purpose of}} Directive 97 / 23 /EC is to {{harmonize}} European national laws regarding design, manufacture and conformity assessment of pressure equipment and assemblies (vessels, storage containers, heat exchangers, shell and water tube boilers, industrial pipework, safety devices and pressure accessories) subject {{to an internal}} pressure greater than 0. 5 bar. In the Directive, equipment is categorized within four levels (I to VI) according to degree of hazard: category III and IV equipment will require conformity assessment by 'notified bodies ' and 'recognised third party organisations ' (NDT personnel {{must be approved by}} a third party organisation recognized by a member state pursuant to Article 13). Equipment manufactured to Harmonized European standards developed in support of the directive will be presumed to comply with the essential safety requirements. For example: EN 13445 (Unfired Pressure Vessels) part 5 - Inspection and testing – requires at clause 6. 1. 3. 5. 7 (Qualification of NDT personnel) that NDT personnel shall be qualified and certified in accordance with EN 473 except for visual examination and leak testing (for which personnel shall be qualified but not certified). So, the qualification and certification requirements for NDT personnel as specified in the harmonized standards are clear, but what are the requirements for NDT personnel when a harmonized standard is not invoked? This paper will discuss the requirements of the Directive in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of NDT personnel, and explain what those bodies notified as ‘Recognised Third Party Organisations ’ will require in order to award ‘Approvals ’ to personnel that are not certificated by a RTPO in accordance with EN 473 (Reference 3), a harmonized standard...|$|E

40|$|To ensure {{harmonised}} {{scientific and}} technical approaches for GMO detection the European Union Reference Laboratory for GM Food and Feed (EURL GMFF) at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed a freely accessible database, called “GMOMETHODS" providing a state-of-the-art catalogue of EU reference methods for GMO analysis. The EURL GMFF launched in 2015 a survey to assess {{the use of these}} EU reference methods by the official GMO control laboratories in the EU and to collect information on non-EU reference methods possibly employed for the same purpose. The survey aimed also to verify if, and to which extent, laboratories use two decision supporting tools, the JRC GMO-Matrix and Event-Finder which are available on the web site of the EURL GMFF. The survey was also directed to verify the types and frequencies of modifications possibly implemented in the protocols of the validated methods used by the official control laboratories. Results from the survey indicate that almost all official control laboratories (98 %) are using event-specific EU reference methods for quantifying GMOs while a lower number of laboratories is using EU reference methods for qualitative analyses (55 % for element-specific methods and 40 % for construct-specific methods). The use of qualitative non-EU reference methods for screening purposes may reflect the laboratory needs when facing rapid alert emergencies of quickly implementing analytical strategies for detecting non-authorised GM events. Indeed genetically modified crops have continued to increase globally, both in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> status and event/trait diversification. In those cases methods validated in collaborative studies and having the status of EU-reference methods are generally not yet available. In the survey close to half of the respondents (41 %- 47 %) declared also to employ to different extents the two JRC decision supporting tools, GMO-Matrix and Event-Finder. Interestingly the survey shows that almost half of the protocols of the reference methods used by the laboratories are somewhat adapted to laboratory specific conditions, mainly with respect to the master mix and the reaction volume of the polymerase chain reactions (PCR) while the primers and probes are never modified. In all cases, the impact of these modifications had been verified by the control laboratory to ensure the equivalence between the adapted and the original protocols. Without such proof, the laboratory would lose its mandatory accreditation. Moreover, participants in Comparative Testing schemes have achieve generally high score performance using those adapted methods suggesting that the modifications implemented do not affect analytical sensitivity, trueness and precision of the original protocols. The outcome of the 2015 survey reveals therefore that the combined efforts of the EURL GMFF and ENGL have been successful for enhancing harmonisation in quantitative GMO analysis by the adoption of {{scientific and technical}} approaches. This achievement allows the consistency of results for GM labelling and an equal-level playing field in the EU Member States. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|E
