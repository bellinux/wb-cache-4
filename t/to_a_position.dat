5|$|In {{matters of}} character, Epaminondas was above reproach {{in the eyes}} of the ancient historians who {{recorded}} his deeds.

Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe.

40|$|Current CGSB testing {{standards}} (CAN/CGSB: 65. 17 - 1999) require that participants be able <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical <b>position</b> in calm water tests only. The effect that two separate wave frequencies {{had on the}} ability of people <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical <b>position</b> was investigated. Twenty-three participants were instructed <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical <b>position</b> in the following conditions: calm water, a regular wave spectrum, and an irregular wave spectrum. There {{were no significant differences in}} the length of time it took <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical <b>position</b> across all three conditions. Visual observations of the participants in the water suggest that more physical effort was required on their part to stabilize themselves while in waves.
