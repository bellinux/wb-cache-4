5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Portugal's {{debt was}} in September 2012 {{forecast}} by the Troika to peak at around 124% of GDP in 2014, {{followed by a}} firm downward trajectory after 2014. Previously the Troika had predicted it would peak at 118.5% of GDP in 2013, so the developments proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> worse than first anticipated, but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well. As a result, from the slightly worse economic circumstances, {{the country has been}} given one more year to reduce the budget deficit to a level below 3% of GDP, moving the target year from 2013 to 2014. The budget deficit for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5%. The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013, with GDP declining 3% in 2012 and 1% in 2013; followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014. Unemployment rate increased to over 17% by end of 2012 but it has since decreased gradually to 10,5% as of November 2016.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Christmas decorations {{include a}} Christmas tree, Yule Goats of straw (such as the Gävle goat), tomte and angel figurines and nativity scenes.

Also, the various 8-inch formats supported by 86-DOS and MS-DOS do not fit this scheme.|$|E
50|$|Ball's move <b>to</b> Southampton <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{symmetrical}} {{in that he}} {{had arrived}} at clubs, being Everton, Arsenal and Southampton in 1966, 1971 and 1976, when each were holders of the FA Cup.

25|$|Kitchener {{received}} a sobering 10–4 loss in game {{one at the}} hands of Sherbrooke. The Rangers played much better in game two, defeating Portland 9–2. Brian Bellows scored 11 seconds into the game, setting a Memorial Cup record. In their third game, the Rangers shut out the Castors 4–0, atoning for the previous lopsided loss in game one. The game was very physical, and included a bench-clearing brawl in the second period. Kitchener seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> worn out the next night, losing 4–2 to Portland.|$|E
25|$|The closest tools {{similar to}} a niddy-noddy are the swift, and the spinner's weasel. Some swifts need to be {{attached}} to the table, and even folding swifts tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> inconvenient to fold and carry and thus are not as portable as a niddy-noddy, and while the swift has other uses (mainly being to hold skeins for balling), it is not as convenient as the niddy-noddy for creating a skein, nor does it allow one to calculate the yardage as easily. A spinner's weasel is also not portable, however it does measure the yardage, and is faster and easier to use.|$|E
25|$|In {{groundbreaking}} research, Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas of the CSIRO Plant Industry and Cooperative Research Centre for Viticulture in Glen Osmond, Australia, {{found that}} Pinot Meunier has a mutation (VvGAI1) that stops it from responding to gibberellic acid, a plant growth hormone. This leads to different, white-haired, leaf and shoot growth, {{and also to}} a slight stunting in growth, explaining why Pinot Meunier plants tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> smaller than Pinot noir. The mutation exist only in the outermost cell layer of the cultivar, the L1 or 'epidermal' layer, meaning Pinot Meunier is a chimera. Through tissue culture, it is thus possible to separate out plants containing both the mutant (L1) and non-mutant (L2) genotypes, yielding a normal Pinot noir -like genotype and an unusual looking L1-genotype vine with compressed internodes and thickly clustered leaves. The mutants could not produce full-grown tendrils, it seems that gibberellic acid converts grapevine flower buds into tendrils.|$|E
50|$|Another use of bit {{stuffing}} is for run length limited coding: {{to limit the}} number of consecutive bits of the same value in the data <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transmitted. <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> of the opposite value is inserted after the maximum allowed number of consecutive <b>bits.</b> Since this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> general rule the receiver doesn't need extra information about the location of the stuffing bits in order to do the de-stuffing.|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to capital punishment, it may make sense <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> defeatist.

Altman described Dotty as [...] "a chip off the old block", as did Nancy Banks-Smith from The Guardian though the Daily Record described Dotty as [...] "a chip off her grandma's block".

30|$|Effect of the {{aperture}} size on analysis was evaluated {{by using the}} basaltic composition (Table  1), and the effect <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> insignificant.

500|$|The recut for BBC1 with Fry as host drew {{particular}} {{criticism as}} to whether its educational methods were suited to an adult demographic. History Today editor Paul Lay called the idea [...] "frightening". Historian and Labour Party MP Tristram Hunt, while admitting {{that he had not}} yet actually seen the programme, voiced his concerns that the show's content was not [...] "challenging and stimulating" [...] enough for the BBC, adding that [...] "For children, Horrible Histories is an exciting aid to engage with the guts and gore of the past, but there are more sophisticated, populist ways of getting people involved in history than this.

50|$|Deflections are the {{distances}} in the EPA space between transient and fundamental affective meanings. For example, a mother complimented {{by a stranger}} feels that the unknown individual is much nicer than <b>a</b> stranger <b>is</b> supposed <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too potent and active as well - thus there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> moderate distance between the impression created and the mother's sentiment about strangers. High deflections in a situation produce an aura of unlikeliness or uncanniness. It is theorized that high deflections maintained over time generate psychological stress.|$|R

30|$|Trust and {{the related}} concept of {{reputation}} are two essential mechanisms in the facilitation of decision making in many economic and social fields, from ancient fish markets to modern eCommerce. In order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applicable, however, the somewhat broad term ‘trust’ has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> specified <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> further. <b>A</b> common definition of trust [4, 26, 27] in computational applications describes it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> subjective expectation of one entity about another within a specific context at a given time. Thus, trust can serve as an estimation of future behavior.|$|R
