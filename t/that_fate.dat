25|$|The {{club was}} {{purchased}} by Calabrese entrepreneur Aldo Spinelli in 1985 and despite no longer having Simoni as manager, Genoa were finishing in {{the top half of}} Serie B. After a slip in form during 1987–88 (failing to be promoted by a mere point in 1986–87, then having to struggle not to be retroceded the following season, being spared <b>that</b> <b>fate</b> again by a mere point), Genoa refocused their energy and were able to achieve promotion back into Serie A in 1988–89, finishing as champions ahead of Bari. Genoa, with an experienced trainer as Osvaldo Bagnoli who knew how to make the best out of underdog teams (he managed to win a championship at the helm of Hellas Verona in the eighties) and with a team sporting the talents of Carlos Aguilera and Tomáš Skuhravý among others achieved highs during the 1990–91 season where they finished fourth, remaining undefeated at home for the entire campaign, winning games against all the big sides including Juventus, Inter, Milan, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, Napoli, as well as their local rivals Sampdoria who won the title that season.|$|E

25|$|According {{to later}} {{accounts}} by Howe’s daughter, Florence Hall, the Howes’ South Boston {{home was a}} stop on the Underground Railroad. This is uncertain, but it is known that Dr. Howe vehemently opposed the Fugitive Slave Law. Two incidents clearly demonstrate this. The first occurred in 1850, when Dr. Howe along with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Theodore Parker and other abolitionists, stormed Faneuil Hall {{in order to try to}} free a captured escaped slave, Anthony Burns. Burns was going to be sent back to his slave owner in Virginia in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Law. The abolitionists hoped to rescue Burns from <b>that</b> <b>fate.</b> Howe declared outside the hall that “No man’s freedom is safe until all men are free.” Shortly afterward the abolitionists stormed the hall, breaking through the door with a battering ram. A deputy was accidentally shot in the ensuing fracas. Federal troops finally put an end to the attempted raid, and Burns was returned to Virginia. The men did not abandon Burns, however, and within a year of his capture, they had raised enough money to purchase Burns’ freedom from his slave owner.|$|E
25|$|Chimène {{is alone}} in {{a room in the}} palace and is torn apart by {{conflicting}} emotions: love, desire for revenge and honour. But she vows to avenge her father (Scene 1). The king enters and tries to console Chimène, treating her as his own daughter: he declares how fond he was of her dead father, but also reveals the respect in which everyone holds Rodrigue, the one man capable of leading the fight against the Moors. Nevertheless, the king promises to capture and punish her father's killer (Scene 2). Left alone with her maids, Chimène reveals her undying love for Rodrigue. She adored him before the fatal duel, and now <b>that</b> <b>fate</b> has divided them and all hope is dead, their love still remains intact. Nevertheless, she says she will do what honour demands, and the more she loves Rodrigue, the more she will seek to punish him (Scene 3). The next scene is taken up by a dramatic duet between Chimène and Rodrigue, who has just arrived: he begs her to kill him, but she fails to follow through with her vow of revenge, and the two are left in despair (Scene 4). Alone again, Rodrigue contemplates death (Scene 5), until he is met by his father and his followers, and asked to march against the army of the Moors which has just laid siege to the city. If he is to die, he should do so nobly for his king and country. Encouraged by his father's words, Rodrigue agrees to fight and the first act ends with a martial chorus (Scene 6).|$|E

[...] Archer resisted capture, but Moloney overpowered him. Moloney was killed later that day, but he received the Medal of Honor for his exploit.

500|$|... "Christmas Tree" [...] is {{a version}} of the {{traditional}} Christmas song [...] "Deck the Halls", with the same melody but with lyrics changed to be sexually suggestive, with many sexual innuendos and metaphors. Lyrically, the song is [...] "lewdly celebratory" [...] with lines such as [...] "Light me up put me on top/ Let's fa-la-la-la-la-, la-la, la, la". In an analysis by Stelios Phili of the Washington Square News, Phili jokes that the meaning of the song is closer to the original version of [...] "Deck the Halls", a Welsh folk song called [...] "Nos Galan" [...] (Welsh for [...] "New Year's Eve") traditionally sung at New Year's Eve, than the English Christmas version. He cites the original first line, [...] "Cold is the man who can't love", and says that Gaga [...] "seeks not to warn against becoming a cold, loveless man, but to prevent <b>that</b> <b>fate</b> by way of some hot lovin'".|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{deals with}} the Book of Revelation, {{particularly}} verse 1:18, [...] "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys to Hell and of death". The Millennium Group believes that the four chosen members are the prophesied Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse; although the group believes <b>that</b> <b>fate</b> is predetermined, they believe they can help by [...] "making it happen themselves". Thus, they commit suicide {{in order to be}} resurrected as the Four Horsemen. Donaldson argues that Johnson and the Millennium Group have taken Jesus' promise of eternal life and resurrection too literally, resulting in [...] "a recreated cycle in this life rather than escape into the next". This is further proved when the four Millennium Group members return as zombies; they have achieved life after death, but only physically—not spiritually—by [...] "abusing Jesus's words to take their fate into their own hands".|$|E
500|$|The Mint Act of 1792 made both {{gold and}} silver legal tender; {{specified}} weights of each was equal to a dollar. [...] The United States Mint struck {{gold and silver}} only when depositors supplied metal, which was returned {{in the form of}} coin. The fluctuation of market prices for commodities meant that either precious metal would likely be overvalued in terms of the other, leading to hoarding and melting; in the decades after 1792, it was usually silver coins which met <b>that</b> <b>fate.</b> [...] In 1806, President Thomas Jefferson officially ordered all silver dollar mintage halted, though production had not occurred since 1804. This was done in part to prevent the coins from being exported to foreign nations for melting, causing a strain on the fledgling Mint for little gain. [...] Over the next quarter century, the silver coin usually struck for bullion depositors was the half dollar. In 1831, Mint Director Samuel Moore requested that President Andrew Jackson lift the restriction against dollar coin production; the president obliged in April of that year. Despite the approval to strike the coins, no silver dollars were minted until 1836.|$|E
500|$|According to one source, these hooks in {{the wall}} as an {{execution}} method were introduced {{with the construction of}} the new city gate in 1573.

Henry Boyde notes that in his own 20 years of captivity there, he knew of only one case where a Christian slave who had murdered his master had met <b>that</b> <b>fate,</b> and [...] "not above" [...] two or three Moors besides. Taken captive in 1596, the barber-surgeon William Davies relates something of the heights involved when thrown upon hooks (although it is somewhat unclear if this relates specifically to the city of Algiers, or elsewhere in the Barbary States): [...] "Their ganshing is after this manner: he sitteth upon a wall, being five fathoms high, within two fathoms of the top of the wall; right under the place where he sits, is a strong iron hook fastened, being very sharp; then he is thrust off the wall upon this hook, with some part of his body, and there he hangeth, sometimes two or three days, before he dieth."
