5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues.

40|$|Researchers in many {{disciplines}} {{have been}} concerned with modeling textual data in order to account for <b>texts</b> <b>as</b> the primary information unit of written communication. The book “Modelling, Learning and Processing of Text-Technological Data Structures” deals with this challenging information unit. It focuses on theoretical foundations of representing natural language <b>texts</b> <b>as</b> well as on concrete operations of automatic text processing. Following this integrated approach, the present volume includes contributions {{to a wide range}} of topics in the context of processing of textual data. This relates to the learning of ontologies from natural language texts, the annotation and automatic parsing of <b>texts</b> <b>as</b> well as the detection and tracking of topics in texts and hypertexts. In this way, the book brings together a wide range of approaches to procedural aspects of <b>text</b> technology <b>as</b> an emerging scientific discipline...|$|R

5|$|Although Greek was {{in common}} use around the Mediterranean and into Asia Minor even beyond Imperial borders, {{linguistic}} {{distribution in the}} eastern part of the Empire was complex. Now-extinct languages in Anatolia included Galatian (the form of Celtic introduced by invading Gauls in the 3rd century BC), Phrygian, Pisidian, and Cappadocian, attested by Imperial-era inscriptions. Christian sources also mention the survival of Galatian, Cappadocian, Mysian, and Isaurian in Asia Minor. Like Greek and Latin, these are categorized as Indo-European. Phrygian is not named as a language in a literary text until the 6th century, but is preserved in about a hundred funerary inscriptions in Greek script, most accompanied by Greek <b>text</b> <b>as</b> well and dating from the 3rd century. A Cappadocian accent in speaking Greek seems to be mentioned in a few sources.|$|E
5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} <b>text</b> <b>as</b> a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E

5|$|ITC Garamond {{was created}} by Tony Stan in 1975, and follows ITC's house style of unusually high x-height. It was {{initially}} intended {{to serve as a}} display version but has been used for text, in which its tight spacing and high x-height gives it a somewhat hectoring appearance. As a result, it has proven somewhat controversial among designers; it is generally considered poorly proportioned for body text. It remains the corporate font of the California State University system in printed <b>text.</b> <b>As</b> seen below, it was also modified into Apple Garamond which served as Apple's corporate font from 1984 until replacement starting in 2002 with Myriad. Publishers using it included O'Reilly Media and French publisher Actes Sud.|$|E
5|$|Johann Kuhnau, Bach's {{predecessor}} as Thomaskantor, {{composed a}} Latin Magnificat in two versions: one version {{with only the}} Latin text of the Magnificat for Marian feasts such as Visitation, and another version expanded with four German and Latin laudes relating to Christmas. When Bach presented his Latin Magnificat in 1723 (E-flat major version, BWV243a) it had the same expandable format: without laudes for Visitation, and with four laudes, on the same <b>text</b> <b>as</b> Kuhnau's, for Christmas. Another composition presented by Bach at that year's feast of the Visitation was Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV147, an expanded version of an Advent cantata composed before his Leipzig period (BWV147a).|$|E
5|$|Krishna-related {{literature}} {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana accords {{a metaphysical}} significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila {{is an act of}} remembering the dharma in the <b>text,</b> <b>as</b> a form of para bhakti (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.|$|E

5|$|Solimán: Solimán {{is first}} {{introduced}} in the <b>text</b> <b>as</b> the slave who receives the fortune of massaging the body of Pauline and also lavishing her beauty with great care. He begins to conduct voodoo rituals with Pauline {{for the sake of}} Leclerc, who has contracted yellow fever. Following the demise of Henri Christophe, Solimán ends up in Europe, where he enjoys the summers. He is given food and drink freely and his appearance is the subject of much attention. He regales exaggerated and embellished tales of his past and even makes an appearance at theatre performances. He later comes across a marble statue of Pauline and this, coupled with memories of the night that witnessed the demise of Henri Christophe, causes him to fall into madness, flee, and eventually succumb to malaria.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of <b>text</b> <b>as</b> well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
