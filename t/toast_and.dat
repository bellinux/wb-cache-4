This did not include the Bow Street Runners, who {{retained}} their own identity until the organisation disbanded in 1839. A new magistrates' court was designed by John Taylor at a cost of £38,400 (now £) and constructed between 1879–81. Oscar Wilde {{was arrested and charged with}} gross indecency at the court in 1895; following an overnight stay on remand, he ordered tea, <b>toast</b> <b>and</b> eggs from the nearby Tavistock Hotel, who delivered them to his cell. In 1961, Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, was brought to the court after demonstrating as part of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He later spent a week at Brixton Prison. The courts closed in July 2006 as its Grade II listing meant it was not economical to update it to modern standards. The building is planned to be converted into a boutique hotel.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya <b>toast</b> <b>and</b> friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall.|$|E
5|$|Ya Kun Kaya Toast {{have over}} forty Singaporean outlets, {{about half of}} which are franchised, and over thirty {{overseas}} outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, traditional methods of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French <b>toast</b> <b>and</b> Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type of toast with soft-boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Old Ebbitt Grill was busiest on {{weekends}} in the spring, when {{high school student}} tourist business was at its highest in the city. The restaurant was praised by the Washington Post {{for being able to}} accommodate large groups, offering a variety of plain and upscale food, providing friendly service, and having the best raw bar in the city. The restaurant was also criticized by the newspaper for being too noisy for conversation, and providing bland hamburgers, salads, and breakfast. By 2008, however, Old Ebbitt Grill had improved. Post food critic Tom Sietsema continued to laud the friendly service. He also praised the Breakfast Club, a deep-fried ham, French <b>toast,</b> <b>and</b> bacon breakfast sandwich; he appreciated small touches such as coat hooks near booths and pepper mills on tables; and found the staff's honesty about menu choices refreshing.|$|E

In 1998, the market closed down, so the stall relocated to Far East Square and was renamed Ya Kun Kaya Toast; the following year, Ah Koon died and his youngest son, Loi Boon Sim Adrin (黎文深), took over the business, determined [...] "to keep his father's legacy going". Realising that Ya Kun had a lot of goodwill and potential, Adrin decided to expand the business, the family opened a second store at Tanjong Pagar and, in 2000, began franchising the brand. Ya Kun were incorporated in 2001, and they launched their first overseas outlet (in Indonesia) in 2002 and expanded their menu (adding ice cream <b>toast</b> <b>and</b> the Toastwich), they have won the 2004 and 2005 Superbrands Award, the 2005 to 2007 SIFST Product Award and the 2008 SPBA-CitiBusiness Regional Brands Award.|$|E

500|$|Russula virescens is an edible {{mushroom}} {{considered to}} be one of the best of the genus Russula, and is popular in Europe, particularly in Spain. In an 1875 work on the uses of fungi, English mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke remarked about the mushroom that [...] "the peasants about Milan are in the habit of putting [...] over wood embers to <b>toast,</b> <b>and</b> eating [...] afterwards with a little salt." [...] The mushroom is often sold as a dried product in Asia, and in China, it can be found in roadside markets. Its smell is not distinctive, but its taste has been described as mild, nutty, fruity, or even sweet. Old specimens may smell of herrings. Drying the mushrooms enhances the nutty flavor. Mushrooms can be sautéed (the green color disappears with cooking), and young specimens that are prepared this way have a potato taste that pairs well with shallots. They are also fried or grilled, or used raw in salads. [...] Young specimens are pale and can be hard to identify, but the characteristic pattern of older fruit bodies makes them hard to confuse with other species. When collecting R.virescens for consumption, caution is of vital importance to avoid confusion with the dangerously poisonous Amanita phalloides (known as the death cap), a mushroom that can be most easily identified by its volva and ring.|$|E
500|$|When the {{war ended}} and the United States turned its focus toward re{{building}}, Roebling started building his Brooklyn Bridge. [...] As the monumental task could affect naval navigation, it required state approval, and the government wanted a thorough review of the engineer's credentials; hence, a Bridge Party was organized. [...] Comprising Roebling and his son, {{as well as their}} fellow bridge engineers, generals, businessmen, and high society figures, the party toured the country to review four bridges Roebling had built before the civil war. [...] The final item on their itinerary was Roebling's Niagara Suspension Bridge. [...] At the dinner to commemorate the end of the bridge tour, civil war veteran General Henry Warner Slocum gave a <b>toast</b> <b>and</b> called the Suspension Bridge a symbol of inspiration for the United States in its rebuilding efforts. [...] This sentiment was shared by the guests and was expressed at later dinners across the United States. [...] The achievement of building a large suspension bridge over a gorge in the face of overwhelming adversityconstant put-downs by the professional community, American and Europeangave the United States a sense of pride. [...] Nationalism rose as the country lauded the bridge. [...] The completion of the bridge that had been deemed impossible by the Western world gave Americans, who had lesser technical accomplishments than Europe at that time, a trophy that stood above any other. [...] The Suspension Bridge became the American symbol to brave the toughest of challenges and do the impossible, pushing their drive for industrialization even harder. Charles W. Woodman specifically drew attention to the Suspension Bridge in his 1865 address to the United States Senate for approval to build a rail system to transport a ship {{out of the water and}} up around the Niagara Falls.|$|E
