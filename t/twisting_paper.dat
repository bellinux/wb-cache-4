Schiller considered her, ever after these youthful sports, as a true and faithful companion in his poetic dreams and attempts; and constantly not only told his Sister, whose silence on such points could be perfect, of all that he secretly did in the way of verse-making in the Karl's School,—which, as we shall see, he entered in 1773,—but if possible brought it upon the scene with her.

Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord--in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden--and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity--a mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down.|$|R

A cracker consists of a segmented cardboard tube wrapped in a brightly decorated <b>twist</b> of <b>paper</b> with a prize in the central chamber, making it resemble an oversized sweet-wrapper. The cracker is pulled apart by two people, each holding an outer chamber, causing the cracker to split unevenly and leaving one person holding the central chamber and prize.

40|$|Traditional methods {{based on}} the product of exponentials (POE) formula are parametrically {{continuous}} and complete for the calibration of the kinematic parameters of serial robots. However, these methods are not minimal due to the constraints of joint <b>twists.</b> This <b>paper</b> puts forward a new POE-based model, whose parameters are totally independent and conform to the formula of minimality. This is the first model that simultaneously satisfies the requirements of parametric continuity, completeness, and minimality with uniform and generic modeling rules. The proposed approach avoids the operations of normalization and orthogonalization which are necessary redundancy elimination steps with the traditional model. Simulations on a SCARA robot and experiments on an ABB IRB 120 robot prove that the new model outperforms in convergence, accuracy, and efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Sheet hinges, thin {{flexures}} {{that are}} rigid {{in the plane}} but which can bend freely, are common in stamped and lithographically manufactured devices. The behavior of these machine elements as joints in a robot is difficult to model because they are two-dimensional continuum elastic bodies that admit three-dimensional motion and <b>twisting.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents a parametric modeling technique {{that can be used}} to accurately predict elastic behavior of sheet hinges in three dimensions. Parameterized backbone curves can be used to represent ruled surface bending in a fashion that implicitly accounts for some of the complex boundary conditions imposed on typical sheet hinges. Approximate methods of integrating the non-commutative equations defining the sheet hinge backbone curves will be discussed, demonstrating acceptable trade-offs between accuracy and representational simplicity in overall model performance.
