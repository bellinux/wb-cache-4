It was quite moving at the end and <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth my eyes were a bit damp").|$|E
500|$|As the {{nominations}} for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards approached, early media reports named True Detective among several potential miniseries candidates, {{due to a}} revision made by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories. By March 2014, HBO had submitted True Detective as a drama series contender, an unconventional move given the show's anthology format and fierce competition {{from the likes of}} Breaking Bad and House of Cards. HBO's decision was censured by FX president John Landgraf, who remarked to reporters at a press event: [...] "My own personal point of view is that a miniseries is a story that ends, a series is a story that continues. <b>To</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth, I think it’s actually unfair for HBO to put True Detective in the drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed-ended series – a la Billy Bob Thornton in Fargo or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in True Detective – who you can’t get to sign on for a seven-year [...] deal." [...] Nevertheless, True Detective emerged as a frontrunner heading into the Primetime Emmy season, and in July 2014, was nominated for twelve awards; its closest rival, Breaking Bad, received sixteen nominations. The series ultimately won five Emmy awards: Outstanding Directing (Fukunaga), Outstanding Casting, Outstanding Main Title Design, Outstanding Make-Up, and Outstanding Cinematography.|$|E
500|$|The booklet {{contains}} outdated {{discussions of}} health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, {{seem to be more}} personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one ("I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me."). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or shouldn't be lived. An example is the poem typed on the [...] "Aye Davanita" [...] page. The song's subtitle is [...] "The song without words", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of [...] "intruder words" [...] is on the [...] "Not for You" [...] lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth ("Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock"). The lyrics to [...] "Whipping" [...] are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against [...] "pro-life" [...] killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for [...] "Corduroy".|$|E

500|$|Bosh has {{traditionally}} played the power forward position, including {{during his first}} season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6ft 11in (2.11m) and 235pounds (107kg), Bosh possesses excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size. He is particularly noted {{for his ability to}} drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he is also proficient—but he is also known for his well-developed jump shot. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: [...] "We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth." [...] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions. He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his [...] "arrival" [...] to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot [...]343 from the three point arc for the season; he improved to [...]400 the following season. Despite his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce."

[...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him.

[...] He added, [...] "Make {{yourself}} at home, Frank. Hit somebody!" [...] Sinatra, whose pet name for Rickles was [...] "bullet-head", enjoyed him {{so much that he}} encouraged other celebrities to see Rickles' act and be insulted by him.

2500|$|Nozomi {{continued}} to enjoy sex {{both within and}} outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. <b>To</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E

Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E

Actress Frances Drake recalled difficulty between Freund, Toland and Considine. Drake said that [...] "Freund {{wanted to be}} the cinematographer at the same time", and that [...] "You never knew who was directing. The producer was dying to, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth, and of course he had no idea of directing." [...] Several titles for the film were announced, and on May 22, 1935, MGM announced that the title would be The Hands of Orlac. The Mad Doctor of Paris was also suggested, but the studio eventually settled on the original title of Mad Love. Shooting finished on June 8, 1935, one week over schedule. After the initial release, MGM cut about fifteen minutes of scenes from the film. Cut scenes included the surgery to get Rollo's hands, a pre-credit warning scene similar to the one in Frankenstein, and Isabel Jewell's entire portrayal of the character Marianne.|$|E
2500|$|Composer Hans Zimmer, {{who scored}} Nolan's Batman film trilogy and Inception, also scored Interstellar. Zimmer and Nolan strived {{to develop a}} unique sound for Interstellar. Zimmer said: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are {{probably}} in the bin." [...] Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer [...] "one page of text" [...] that [...] "had {{more to do with}} [...] story than the plot of the movie". Nolan has stated that he said to Zimmer: [...] "I am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It's going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> fable {{at the center of the}} story. You work for one day, then play me what you have written", and that he embraced what Zimmer composed. Zimmer conducted [...] sessions for Interstellar, which was three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.|$|E

I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E
