5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are <b>the</b> saltwater <b>crocodile,</b> <b>the</b> Nile <b>crocodile,</b> and <b>the</b> American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, <b>the</b> Morelet's <b>crocodile,</b> <b>the</b> mugger <b>crocodile,</b> <b>the</b> American <b>crocodile,</b> <b>the</b> gharial, and <b>the</b> freshwater <b>crocodile.</b>|$|R

Tourists can then take photographs while holding <b>the</b> <b>crocodile's</b> tails, after <b>the</b> guide has fed them a chicken. There are concerns that the pond is now too reliant on tourism, with caretaker Salifu Awewozem saying in 2009 that <b>the</b> elderly <b>crocodiles</b> require specialist care, and the only time additional food is provided to the reptiles is when tourists pay for the chickens when they pose for photographs.|$|R

5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch. Then on 10 February it {{was attached}} to the payload adaptor, and encapsulated in the payload fairing, to form a unit known as the Space Head Module. This was transported to the launch pad by means of a vehicle known as <b>the</b> <b>crocodile,</b> and installed atop the carrier rocket. Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Whether the bigeye and {{smalltooth}} sand tigers {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to <b>the</b> <b>crocodile</b> shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|E

5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? <b>The</b> <b>crocodile</b> etc. {{obviously}} used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
5|$|However, the toad was {{generally}} unsuccessful {{in reducing the}} targeted grey-backed cane beetles (Dermolepida albohirtum), {{in part because the}} cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, in part because the beetles live at the tops of sugar cane – and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian biodiversity. The population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the varanid lizards Varanus mertensi, V. mitchelli, and V. panoptes, the land snakes Pseudechis australis and Acanthophis antarcticus, and <b>the</b> <b>crocodile</b> species Crocodylus johnstoni; in contrast, the population of the agamid lizard Amphibolurus gilbertiknown to be a prey item of V. panopteshas increased.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a corner}} of the Jydegaard Formation is exposed today; the {{remainder}} is overgrown. Jydegaard is part of the Nyker Group, which includes three formations (Rabekke, Robbedale and Jydegaard) ranging from the Berriasian to the Valanginian ages of the Early Cretaceous. Jydegaard consists of sediments deposited in a fresh-to-brackish lagoon facing a coastal strip. In addition to Dromaeosauroides and a possible titanosaur, remains of hybodont sharks, fish such as Lepidotes and Pleuropholis, turtles, lizards, <b>the</b> <b>crocodile</b> Pholidosaurus and thin bone fragments from birds or pterosaurs have been found in the deposit. The bivalve Neomiodon is found in abundance in the sediments below (the Neomiodon Bed), indicating mass mortality, perhaps due to dinoflagellate toxins.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and <b>the</b> <b>crocodile</b> (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of <b>The</b> <b>Crocodile</b> Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector <b>the</b> <b>Crocodile</b> can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E

5|$|Schoeman mustered a {{commando}} at Potchefstroom, but was routed by Kruger on {{the night}} of 9 October 1862. After Schoeman returned with a larger force Kruger and Pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on the disturbances in January 1863, and soon thereafter fresh elections for President and Commandant-General. Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. In May the election results were announced—Van Rensburg became President, with Kruger as Commandant-General. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. Van Rensburg's opponent this time was Pretorius, who had resigned his office in the Orange Free State and returned to the Transvaal. Turnout was higher and on 12 October the volksraad announced another Van Rensburg victory. Kruger was returned as Commandant-General with a large majority. The civil war ended with Kruger's victory over Jan Viljoen's commando, raised in support of Pretorius and Schoeman, at <b>the</b> <b>Crocodile</b> River on 5 January 1864. Elections were held yet again, and this time Pretorius defeated Van Rensburg. Kruger was re-elected as Commandant-General with over two-thirds of the vote.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Devonian period (360 {{million years}} ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have {{sometimes}} hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were {{at the top of the}} food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by <b>the</b> <b>crocodile.</b> Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.|$|E
5|$|Lions tend to {{dominate}} smaller felids such as African cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah {{in particular has}} a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators. Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, accounting for up to 78.2% of predator-killed juveniles in one study. Cheetahs avoid their competitors using different temporal (time) and spatial (habitat) niches. Leopards are able to take refuge in trees; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills. Similarly, lions dominate African wild dogs, not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, {{there are a few}} reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs. African lions may also conflict with Nile crocodiles. Depending on the size of <b>the</b> <b>crocodile</b> and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land, while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways, as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.|$|E
