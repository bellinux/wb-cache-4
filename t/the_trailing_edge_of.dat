5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing were also {{pneumatically}} operated via a finger lever {{on the instrument}} panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the {{transmitter}} pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short}} time even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as {{the transmitter}} break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E
2500|$|Nowhere in {{the patent}} {{is there a}} {{description}} of mounting the ailerons on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airplane's wings, where they would have induced adverse yaw, but only [...] "...on arms projecting from the vessel laterally". Indeed, the first ailerons used by Robert Esnault-Pelterie in 1904 were mounted inter-wing, not on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glider's wings where they would have created unequal aileron drag.|$|R
50|$|In {{circulation}} control, near <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> wings, aircraft {{flight control}} systems {{are replaced by}} slots which emit fluid flows.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 8 mm. They have narrow wings, long hair scales on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings and sombre colours.|$|R
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
50|$|The Kutta {{condition}} is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> airfoils. It {{is named for}} German mathematician and aerodynamicist Martin Wilhelm Kutta.|$|R
50|$|The cantilever, mid set, wooden {{wing of the}} OE-1 {{consisted}} of three parts: the 9 m span 90 cm chord rectangular planform centre section and two tapered outer panels 4.5 m span and rounded wing-tips. Three position plain flaps were fitted to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre section with a chord of 24 cm and set positions of −0.5, +8 and +80 degrees. Ailerons occupied <b>the</b> entire <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer panels. A shallow gull form was due to reduced dihedral on the outer panels.|$|R
50|$|Altogether, the {{aerodynamic}} forces co-interact, creating turbulence that amplifies {{small changes}} in {{the surface of the}} paper aircraft. Modifications can be made to most paper airplanes by bending, curving or making small cuts in <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> wings and in the airplane's tail, if it has one.|$|R
5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. <b>The</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing twisted {{slightly}} upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E
50|$|Application of {{the area}} rule {{can also be seen}} in the use of anti-shock bodies on {{transonic}} aircraft, including some jet airliners. Anti-shock bodies, which are pods along <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings, serve the same role as the narrow waist fuselage design of other transonic aircraft.|$|R
25|$|High-speed {{cameras are}} also {{required}} {{when the subject}} of the test is itself moving at high speed, such as an airplane propeller. The camera can capture stop-motion images of how the blade cuts through the particulate streams and how vortices are generated along <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving blade.|$|R
5000|$|The Inca tern {{is a large}} tern, {{approximately}} [...] long. Sexes are similar; {{the adult}} is mostly slate-grey with white restricted to the facial plumes and <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings. The large bill and legs are dark red. Immature birds are purple-brown, and gradually develop the facial plumes.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} hit {{the water}} with the tail first. The impact caused the fuselage to break into three main parts. The largest was the 26-meter (85ft) forward section of the aircraft, from the nose to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wings. It remained afloat after the accident for about twenty hours. The midsection was 13meters (42ft) long, from <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing to the rear pressure bulkhead. The aft section consisted of the tail cone, including all of the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizers. The engines and landing gear separated from the aircraft {{at the time of}} impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms of}} commotio cordis are still poorly understood, but probably {{related to the}} activation of mechanosensitive proteins, ion channels. These trigger extra electrical excitation waves which, if occurring right at <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a previous electrical cycle, can give rise to ventricular fibrillation. Since <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the preceding electrical cycle travels over the ventricular surface, the critical window for mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation varies locally - i.e. the commotio cordis risk window exists in time and in space. This helps to explain why precordial impacts tend to have benign consequences.|$|E
25|$|Olympus driving aft fan: BS.81 {{rated at}} 28,000lb. As an {{alternative}} to afterburning a fan mounted at <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing was proposed for the Vulcan Phase 6. The fan was driven by a turbine in the engine exhaust {{at the end of}} the jetpipe.|$|E
5000|$|Anti-shock body: a {{streamlined}} pod shape {{added to}} <b>the</b> leading or <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> an aerodynamic surface, {{to delay the}} onset of shock stall and reduce transonic wave drag. Examples include the Küchemann carrots on <b>the</b> wing <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Handley Page Victor B.2.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the control surfaces, based on a design by Short Brothers and adopted after {{experiments}} by the National Physical Laboratory, consisted of quadruple rudders and triple elevators attached to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cruciform tail surfaces, supplemented by forward mounted triplane elevators and small triple rudders behind the aft gondola.|$|R
50|$|Trim controls, {{which usually}} {{take the form}} of knobs or wheels and are used to adjust pitch, roll, or yaw trim. These are often {{connected}} to small airfoils on <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control surfaces called 'trim tabs'. Trim is used {{to reduce the amount of}} pressure on the control forces needed to maintain a steady course.|$|R
25|$|When on {{approach}} to land, the pilot would push the stick forward to gain speed for the flare and landing. As speed built up, the rear wing, operating at a greater {{angle of attack}} would gain lift and pitch the aircraft's nose further downward. The pilot's normal reaction would be to pull back on the stick. This action would increase the angle of attack on the front wing by lowering <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing. Because <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the front wing {{was close to the}} leading edge of the rear wing, the front wing's downwash would accelerate the air over the rear wing and cause it to gain lift more quickly than the front wing, resulting in an ever-increasing nose pitch-down and flight directly into the ground.|$|E
25|$|Before {{a tornado}} strikes an area, {{the wind has}} been known to die down and the air to become very still. A cloud of debris has {{sometimes}} marked the bottom of a tornado even when the funnel was not visible. Tornadoes typically occur along <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a thunderstorm.|$|E
25|$|Trim tabs {{are small}} {{surfaces}} connected to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a larger control surface, {{such as a}} rudder, on an aircraft, used to control the trim of the controls, i.e. to counteract aerodynamic forces and stabilise the aircraft in a particular desired attitude {{without the need for}} the operator to constantly apply a control force. This is done by adjusting the angle of the tab relative to the larger surface.|$|E
50|$|Controls:Conventional {{control stick}} and rudder pedals {{operated}} the controls via pushrods. Roll and camber control were achieved through four full span differentially operated Duralumin skinned flaperons on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainplanes. Approach control was achieved through Göppingen type airbrakes on {{upper and lower}} wing surfaces. Wing loading could also be adjusted on the ground by attaching ballast to the wing roots.|$|R
50|$|Ion {{generators}} {{are sometimes}} used to inject ions into the ambient airstream. Ionization systems help to neutralize charged surface regions on insulative or dielectric materials. Insulating materials prone to triboelectric charging {{should be kept}} away from sensitive devices to prevent accidental charging of devices through induction. On aircraft, static dischargers are used on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> wings and other surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Production {{aircraft}} {{differed in}} minor details from the prototype. The transition between the upper decking and the aircraft sides was rounded off, the three struts bracing the tailplane {{were reduced to}} two, and <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower wing were hinged to fold 90° upwards rather than 180° downwards when the wings were folded, and the external oil cooler was omitted.|$|R
25|$|The first {{aircraft}} J7765 {{was delivered}} to the A at RAF Martlesham Heath in 1926 and 1927. J7766, delivered the following year, was distinguished by having engine nacelles that extended aft of <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing, the wing with duralumin spars and a metal-covered wing centre section, and a more rounded nose shape. The modified nose and nacelle shapes were also introduced on the first prototype.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{control of}} the Regulus II was {{through the use of}} elevons fitted to the outer half of the wing {{trailing}}-edges, as the missile was not fitted with a tailplane, and a rudder fitted to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the fin. Flaps were fitted to the inner half of the trailing edge for use during takeoff. Additional stability and control in pitch was provided by small trapezoidal canard foreplanes near the nose of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Defensive {{armament}} was two 0.50in (12.7mm) {{machine guns}} each side in <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing, which retracted into the wing {{when not in}} use. These guns were aimed by the copilot through a sighting station {{at the rear of}} his cockpit. The guns had a limited field of fire and could only cover the rear, but with the aircraft's high speed it was thought unlikely that intercepting fighters would be attacking from any other angle.|$|E
5000|$|Semi-{{elliptical}}: only <b>the</b> leading or <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> is elliptical {{with the}} other being straight, as with <b>the</b> elliptical <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seversky P-35.|$|R
25|$|The H-101 {{differs from}} the Libelle in having a V-tail, showing its ancestry to the V-tailed Hütter H-30 GFK. Four {{flush-fitting}} air brakes were fitted to <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings, replacing the more conventionally sited air brakes of the Standard Libelle. The Salto's air brakes are hinged at their midpoints so that half the surface projects above the wing and half below.|$|R
50|$|The Poite 3 had a three part, low, {{cantilever}} wing, {{built around}} twin spars {{and having a}} high aspect ratio (10.8). There was a rectangular centre-section which filled about {{one quarter of the}} span and almost triangular outer panels which carried light dihedral and tapered in thickness. Its ailerons occupied about half <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer panels and increased in chord inboard.|$|R
