The use of such disposals varies from police force to police force. Careful monitoring of their use is required to ensure they are only used appropriately and not primarily as a means of police saving time and, or, improving the 'clear up' rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{psychiatric}} {{assessment of}} a child or adolescent starts with obtaining a psychiatric history by interviewing <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>person</b> and his/her parents or caregivers. The assessment includes a detailed exploration of the current concerns about the child's emotional or behavioral problems, the child's physical health and development, history of parental care (including possible abuse and neglect), family relationships and history of parental mental illness. It is regarded as desirable to obtain information from multiple sources (for example both parents, or a parent and a grandparent) as informants may give widely differing accounts of the child's problems. Collateral information is usually obtained from the child's school with regards to academic performance, peer relationships, and behavior in the school environment.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{education}} may be taught informally, {{such as when}} someone receives information from {{a conversation with a}} parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>person</b> what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Incest {{between a}} child or {{adolescent}} and a related adult is known as child incestuous abuse, and {{has been identified as}} the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity to damage <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>person.</b> One researcher stated that more than 70% of abusers are immediate family members or someone very close to the family. Another researcher stated that about 30% of all perpetrators of sexual abuse are related to their victim, 60% of the perpetrators are family acquaintances, like a neighbor, babysitter or friend and 10% of the perpetrators in child sexual abuse cases are strangers. A child sexual abuse offense where the perpetrator is related to the child, either by blood or marriage, is a form of incest described as intrafamilial child sexual abuse.|$|E

500|$|Alfred Bem postulates in Dramatizatsiia breda that The Landlady {{incorporates}} autobiographical elements. Influenced by Freud's psychoanalysis, {{he argued}} that Ordynov's familial relationship with Katerina and Murin was similar to Dostoyevsky's own, and found reflections of the writer's affair with Avdotya Panayeva, whom he met within her husband's political circle. Bem states that tiring quarrels between circle members Nikolay Nekrasov and Ivan Turgenev worsened Dostoyevsky's health, although he had stress problems prior to working on The Landlady. Elements of Gothic literature were also detected in the story's dark atmosphere, and the strange character {{of the relationship between}} Katerina and Ordynov. [...] believes that the novella discusses good and evil. The critic Stanisław Mackiewicz stated that he found [...] "the key to understand its symbolic content and Belinsky's fierce rejection. I am of the belief that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>person</b> represents the Russian intelligence, and the woman with the expressive name 'The Landlady' the Russian folk, while the haunted fortuneteller echoes the religious beliefs of that folk and especially the schismatic Old Believers." ...|$|E
500|$|A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{unveiled}} the government's plans in his Queen's Speech. The plans included the duty {{for parents to}} assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation {{in some form of}} education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>person</b> must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.|$|E
