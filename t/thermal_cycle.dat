The purpose of this development was to validate the use of the rover external fiber optic cabling of ChemCam for space applications under the extreme thermal environments to be encountered during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. Flight-representative fiber optic cables were subjected to extreme temperature thermal cycling of the same diurnal depth (or delta T) as expected in flight, but for three times the expected number of in-flight <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles.</b> The survivability of fiber optic cables was tested for 600 cumulative <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> from - 130 to + 15 C to cover the winter season, and another 1, 410 cumulative cycles from - 105 to + 40 C to cover the summer season.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> {{ranging from}} room {{temperature}} to 400 °F and from room temperature to 550 °F {{were performed on}} the IM 7 / 8552 composite material. It was found through tension testing that the resin dependent strength properties, such as the σ 12 and σ 22 strength, decreased in strength {{as the number of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> increased. The σ 12 strength was cycled at both 550 °F and 400 °F, and the σ 22 strength was cycled at 400 °F. It was also found while cycling at 400 °F that the E 1 and E 2 modulus don’t change as the number of <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> increase, and the σ 11 strength degrades initially due to its dependence of the resin for transferring stress from fiber to fiber, but then it’s strength does not degrade further as the number of <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> increase. The E 1, E 2 modulus, and σ 11, σ 22 strength were not tested for after cycling at 550 °F. Curve fitting methods were applied to the data to establish a model capable of performing failure prediction of any IM 7 / 8552 composite laminate thermally cycled within the limits of this research. The shear strength was tested for after thermal cycling from room temperature to 550 °F and it was found that after five <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> the strength reduced by more than 42 %, and about 60 % after 15 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles.</b> While <b>thermal</b> cycling from room temperature to 400 °F the E 1 and E 2 modulus were tested, as well as the σ 11, σ 22, and σ 12 strengths. The σ 22 and σ 12 strength were certainly affected but not as critically as when thermal cycling to 550 °F. The σ 12 strength only reduced by 6 % after 15 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles,</b> and then after 100 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> it reduced by 16 %. The σ 22 strength reduced by 62 % after 100 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles.</b> It was expected it would drop more than the σ 12 strength since the σ 22 strength is more dependent on resin strength. It was determined that the cause of the degradation was due to the resin system of the composite material being burned off during thermal cycling. Keeping track of the mass property during thermal cycling helped obtain this conclusion. ^ While thermal cycling to 550 °F more than 3 % of the mass was lost after five <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> and more than 4 % after 15 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles.</b> X-rays of the [45 /- 45 / 45 /- 45]S specimen were performed to see if microcracking due to residual thermal stresses might be a contributing factor, but the x-rays showed no signs of microcracking within any of the specimen. Similarly, while thermal cycling at 400 °F the mass dropped by 0. 6 % after 15 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> and 1. 2 % after 100 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles,</b> with no signs of microcracking showing up on the [45 /- 45 / 45 /- 45]S specimen x-rays. The difference in the amount of mass loss between thermal cycling to 550 °F and then to 400 °F is attributed to the fact that 550 °F is 150 °F higher than 400 °F. Two different curve fitting methods were used to best fit the data obtained from tension testing, a linear regression model using least squares method, and a first order exponential decay model. The linear model fit the modulus and strength data obtained from thermal cycling to 400 °F the best. The exponential decay model fit the shear strength data from thermal cycling to 550 °F and the mass data from both thermal cycling tests the best. If more <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> were performed on the specimen showing a linear decreasing trend, it is assumed the data would eventually flatten out to some asymptotic value, much like the exponential decay model, since it isn’t possible for thermal cyclic loads to drive a material to failure all by itself. ...|$|R

This study aimed to assess the effect of aging by thermocycling (5, 000 and 10, 000 cycles) and mechanical surface treatments (Er,Cr:YSGG laser and bur) on repair shear bond strength of composite resin. Totally, 120 composite blocks measuring 6 x 4 x 4 mm were fabricated of Filtek Z 250 composite and were randomly divided into three groups (n= 40) based on initial aging protocol: (a) no aging: storage in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours, (b) 5, 000 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles,</b> (c) 10, 000 <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles.</b> Each group was then randomly divided into two subgroups (n= 20) based on mechanical surface treatment (laser and bur).

5000|$|The Hunt GravityPlane (not to be {{confused}} with the ground-based gravity plane) is a proposed gravity-powered glider by Hunt Aviation in the USA. [...] It also has aerofoil wings, improving its lift-drag ratio and making it more efficient. The GravityPlane requires a large size in order to obtain a large enough volume-to-weight ratio to support this wing structure, and no example has yet been built. Unlike a powered glider, the GravityPlane does not consume power during the climbing phase of flight. It does however consume power at the points where it changes its buoyancy between positive and negative values. Hunt claim that this can nevertheless improve the energy efficiency of the craft, similar to the improved energy efficiency of underwater gliders over conventional methods of propulsion. Hunt suggest that the low power consumption should allow the craft to harvest sufficient energy to stay aloft indefinitely. The conventional approach to this requirement is the use of solar panels in a solar-powered aircraft. Hunt has proposed two alternative approaches. One is to use a wind turbine and harvest energy from the airflow generated by the gliding motion, the other is a <b>thermal</b> <b>cycle</b> to extract energy from the differences in air temperature at different altitudes.|$|E

At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, <b>thermal</b> <b>cycle,</b> and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a [...] "WIP chart system" [...] by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01 Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework. When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.|$|E
5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant <b>thermal</b> <b>cycle,</b> its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|E

40|$|The {{thermomechanical}} fatigue of a Cu-Al-Ni {{shape memory}} alloy has been studied. For this test, a static compressive stress {{has been applied to}} cylindrical samples during a large number of <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> (about 10, 000). The influence of the applied stress and of the number of <b>thermal</b> <b>cycles</b> on high and low temperature strains has been measured as well as the memory strain amplitude. The effect of a thrust limiting the deformation in the martensitic state, and also of a previous cycling has been analysed...|$|R
