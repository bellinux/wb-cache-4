2500|$|In mid-2004, Utada {{moved back}} to New York, and began work on a new {{recording}} contract with Island Def Jam Music Group. On October 5, 2004, she released her North American English-language debut album, Exodus, under the name [...] "Utada," [...] which was her new American-given artist title at the Universal Convention. It was released nearly a month earlier, on September 9 in Japan, with a special booklet and housed in a cardboard slipcase. In an MTV interview, Utada said: [...] "I don't think it's the music that I'm concerned about. It's obviously <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> really different and there really aren't any completely Asian people [...] right now."

In spite of enlisting Timbaland to produce and co-write some songs, her American debut as an Island Records artist was met with indifference by the American market, selling 55,000 units. [...] "Easy Breezy" [...] was released as the lead single in early August 2004, peaking at number 9 Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay chart, followed up by [...] "Devil Inside" [...] a month and two weeks later. And Utada became {{the cover of the}} Interview magazine June 2005 issue.|$|E
