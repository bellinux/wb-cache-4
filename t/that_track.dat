When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} <b>that</b> <b>track</b> man. We ripped <b>that</b> <b>track.</b> That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
5|$|Mirroring {{the role}} <b>that</b> <b>track</b> and field events {{have at the}} Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is {{featured}} within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among {{some of the first}} of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} <b>that</b> <b>track</b> surfaces, horseshoes with toe grabs, use of certain legal medications, and high-intensity racing {{schedules}} may {{also contribute to}} a high injury rate. One promising trend {{is the development of}} synthetic surfaces for racetracks, {{and one of the first}} tracks to install such a surface, Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky, saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004–05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation. The material is not perfected, and some areas report problems related to winter weather, but studies are continuing.|$|E

5|$|With {{the funds}} {{available}} from the UERL, construction began in July 1902 at Knightsbridge, before the formal approval of the merger of the B and GN Work proceeded quickly, enabling the UERL to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the tunnels had been completed and <b>that</b> <b>track</b> laying was about to begin. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Except for Finsbury Park, where the platforms were {{close enough to the}} surface to be accessed by stairs, and Gillespie Road where a long ramp was used, each of the stations with platforms in tube tunnels was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} single-engine {{steering system}} in mechanical terms, and almost universally used on early tank designs, was {{the combination of}} a brake and a clutch connected to steering controls. The controls were normally a pair of vertical handles, one for each track. Pulling on a handle disengaged the clutch, releasing <b>that</b> <b>track</b> and causing it to slow down. Further motion of the handle increasingly applied the brake to <b>that</b> <b>track,</b> allowing the turning circle to be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{dependent}} on {{the efficacy of the}} arbitrage mechanism in order for their share price to track net asset value. While the average deviation between the daily closing price and the daily NAV of ETFs <b>that</b> <b>track</b> domestic indices is generally less than 2%, the deviations may be more significant for ETFs <b>that</b> <b>track</b> certain foreign indices. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2008, during a period of market turbulence, that some lightly traded ETFs frequently had deviations of 5% or more, exceeding 10% in a handful of cases, although even for these niche ETFs, the average deviation was only a little more than 1%. The trades with the greatest deviations tended to be made immediately after the market opened.|$|E

The results showed that during those years, half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile, with half of those in the bottom quintile moving to a higher one. About 60% of taxpayers in the top 1% in 1996 no longer stayed in that category by 2005.|$|E

25|$|Many {{index funds}} and {{exchange-traded}} funds attempt to replicate (before fees and expenses) {{the performance of}} the S500 by holding the same stocks as the index, in the same proportions. Many other mutual funds are benchmarked to the S500. Consequently, a company whose stock is added to the list of S500 stocks may see its stock price rise, as index funds must purchase that company's stock in order to continue tracking the S 500 index. Mutual fund managers provide index funds <b>that</b> <b>track</b> the S500, the first of which was The Vanguard Group's Vanguard500 in 1976.|$|E
25|$|At Loudon, Johnson {{finished}} 6th after {{blowing a}} tire in the 3rd position. At Dover, his Chase hopes {{came to an}} end when his car broke a drive line, leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps to go. This marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on <b>that</b> <b>track,</b> having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt's career wins. Also in the process, he snapped a 20-race-winless-streak.|$|E
25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and <b>that</b> <b>track</b> to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E
