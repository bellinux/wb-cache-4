5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various <b>transcription</b> factors, which are proteins that regulate <b>transcription.</b> Each <b>transcription</b> factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the <b>transcription</b> of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The <b>transcription</b> factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for <b>transcription,</b> either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin <b>transcription.</b> Alternatively, <b>transcription</b> factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some <b>transcription</b> factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, <b>transcription</b> is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the <b>transcription</b> factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the <b>transcription</b> of the target genes.|$|E
5|$|RAFA domains, or {{polymorphic}} interphase karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, {{though they were}} not thought {{to be associated with}} active DNA replication, <b>transcription,</b> or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the <b>transcription</b> factor PTF, which promotes <b>transcription</b> of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).|$|E

50|$|IPA is very flexible, {{allowing}} {{for a wide variety}} of <b>transcriptions</b> between broad phonemic <b>transcriptions</b> which describe the significant units of meaning in language, and phonetic <b>transcriptions</b> which may indicate every nuance of sound in detail.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for automatic procedures to generate and validate phonetic <b>transcriptions.</b> As the production of manual phonetic <b>transcriptions</b> tends to be time-consuming, error-prone and costly, procedures {{have been developed to}} derive phonetic <b>transcriptions</b> automatically by means of automatic speech recognition technology. Such automatic phonetic <b>transcriptions</b> are usually validated by comparing them with manual phonetic <b>transcriptions.</b> Even though this appears to be a plausible procedure at first sight, it might be troublesome. We believe that phonetic <b>transcriptions</b> should ideally be validated with potential applications in mind. The application focused on in this paper is the reduction of word error rates in automatic speech recognition...|$|R
5|$|Reverse <b>transcription</b> is the {{transfer}} of information from RNA to DNA (the reverse of normal <b>transcription).</b> This is known {{to occur in the}} case of retroviruses, such as HIV, as well as in eukaryotes, in the case of retrotransposons and telomere synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the nucleus}} {{is the site}} of <b>transcription,</b> it also {{contains}} a variety of proteins that either directly mediate <b>transcription</b> or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of <b>transcription</b> factors that regulate expression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Transcription</b> in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial <b>transcription,</b> with the archaeal RNA polymerase being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in <b>transcription</b> seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general <b>transcription</b> factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal <b>transcription</b> factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
40|$|For {{research}} and development purposes {{in the areas of}} phonetics and speech technology, phonetically transcribed speech may be of great value. In the near future, the Spoken Dutch Corpus (CGN) is going to offer such <b>transcriptions</b> for about one thousand hours of spoken Dutch, of which 90 % will consist of automatic <b>transcriptions</b> and 10 % of manually produced <b>transcriptions.</b> An advantage of automatically produced <b>transcriptions</b> is that they are maximally reliable; they are however not necessarily maximally accurate. One way of making them more accurate is having them checked and modified manually, but it is widely accepted that human <b>transcriptions</b> tend to be subjective and unreliable. The goal {{of this paper is to}} establish if human CGN transcribers succeeded in making accurate <b>transcriptions</b> by correcting automatic <b>transcriptions,</b> while maintaining a high level of reliability...|$|R
30|$|First, {{hypothesis}} <b>transcriptions</b> {{were produced}} using the spliced MFCC features. These <b>transcriptions</b> were {{then used to}} estimate the fMLLR transforms as explained above. The accuracy of the hypothesis <b>transcriptions</b> obtained after SAT was much better than that before SAT.|$|R
40|$|Automatically {{generated}} detailed <b>transcriptions</b> {{should be}} helpful for transcribers anno-tating speech databases with detailed <b>transcriptions.</b> In this paper, a method for creating detailed <b>transcriptions</b> using a digitised speech signal, word boundary annotation, canon-ical <b>transcriptions</b> and näıve pronunciation rules is described. Some initial results using word boundaries from an automatic alignment system are presented. Although this data {{has been based on}} partly erroneous alignments, the results seem plausible. The sys-tem will be developed so that it can use manually annotated word boundaries for forced alignment of canonical <b>transcriptions.</b> This will probably enhance system performance considerably. ...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to <b>transcription</b> factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound <b>transcription</b> factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase <b>transcription</b> by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic <b>transcription,</b> in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow <b>transcription.</b> A coarser <b>transcription</b> which ignores some of this detail is called a broad <b>transcription.</b> Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Between 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic {{work for}} full orchestra.

50|$|During this time, <b>transcriptions</b> {{of other}} music (usually orchestral music or piano solos) for organ became popular.

He transcribed hundreds of works for the organ, the most memorable being his <b>transcriptions</b> of Wagner works.|$|R
5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires gene <b>transcription</b> and protein synthesis in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene <b>transcription</b> and protein synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid hormones act by {{crossing}} the cell membrane and binding to intracellular nuclear thyroid hormone receptors TR-α1,TR-α2,TR-β1 and TR-β2, which bind with hormone response elements and <b>transcription</b> factors to modulate DNA <b>transcription.</b> In {{addition to these}} actions on DNA, the thyroid hormones also act within the cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with enzymes, including calcium ATPase, adenylyl cyclase, and glucose transporters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Transcription</b> is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and <b>transcription</b> factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire <b>transcription</b> process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E
