50|$|A bleed-type manual boost {{controller}} simple {{mechanical and}} pneumatic control to allow some {{pressure from the}} wastegate actuator to escape or bleed out to the atmosphere or back into the intake system. This {{can be as simple}} as a <b>T-fitting</b> on the boost control line near the actuator with a small bleeder screw. The screw can be turned out to varying degrees to allow air to bleed out of the system, relieving pressure on the wastegate actuator, thus increasing boost levels. These devices are popular due to their negligible cost compared to other devices that may offer the same power increase.|$|E
50|$|Where {{multiple}} {{tanks are}} fitted, {{a combination of}} check valves and a hydrostatic relief valve are usually installed to prevent fuel from flowing from one tank to another. In Australia, {{there is a common}} assembly designed for this purpose. It is a combined twin check valve and hydrostatic relief valve assembly built {{in the form of a}} <b>T-fitting,</b> such that the lines from the tanks come into the sides of the valve and the outlet to the converter comes out the end. Because there is only one common brand of these valves, they are known colloquially as a Sherwood valve.|$|E
50|$|In {{installations}} {{where more}} than one tank is fitted, <b>T-fittings</b> {{may be used to}} connect the tanks to one filler so that the tanks are filled simultaneously. In some applications, more than one filler may be fitted, such as {{on opposite sides of the}} vehicle. These may be connected to separate tanks, or may be connected to the same tanks using <b>T-fittings</b> in the same manner as for connecting multiple tanks to one filler.|$|R
