5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached in 1984 between the Grand County Commission and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to balance the conflicting public demands to retire and preserve the aging bridge. As part of this agreement, UDOT would commission a new bridge and once finished, transfer ownership of the original bridge back to Grand County. Grand County agreed to petition to have the bridge {{be included in the}} National Register of Historic Places, assume maintenance and guarantee the bridge would be preserved. The nomination was approved and the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1984. In 1988, the replacement bridge was completed, and the <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> to the Dewey Bridge was handed over to the county in 1989. Grand County completed a restoration project in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into a toll-free highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|Sweden's {{weak economy}} had {{suffered}} {{during the war}} and was now in a deep crisis. Charles assembled the Riksdag of the Estates in October 1680. The assembly has been described {{as one of the most}} important held by the Riksdag of the Estates. Here, the king finally pushed through the reduction ordeal, something that had been discussed in the Riksdag since 1650. It meant that any land or object previously owned by the crown and lent or given away— including counties, baronies and lordships— could be recovered. It affected many prominent members of the nobility, some of whom were ruined by it. One of them was the former guardian and Lord Chief Justice Magnus De La Gardie, who, among many other Estates, had to return the extravagant 248-room Läckö Castle. The reduction process involved the examination of every <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> in the kingdom, including the dominions, and it resulted in a complete readjustment of the nation's finances.|$|E

5|$|The {{garden was}} {{saved by the}} Member of {{parliament}} Albert Grant, who purchased the park in 1874 for £11,060 and donated it to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> for the square passed to the succeeding public bodies {{and is now in}} the ownership of the City of Westminster. After the purchase, the architect James Knowles redesigned the park. A statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins was constructed in the centre. The four corner gates of the park had one bust each of famous former residents in the square: the scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed by W. Calder Marshall; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first President of the Royal Academy by H. Weekes; John Hunter, a pioneer of surgery, by T. Wooler; and William Hogarth, the painter, by J. Durham. Ownership transferred to Westminster City Council in 1933. The most recent addition was a bronze statue of film star and director Charlie Chaplin, designed by sculptor John Doubleday in 1981. On the pavement were inscribed the distances in miles to several Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Kenya and Jamaica. After the Great Outdoors refurbishment of the square, only the statue of Shakespeare still remains.|$|E

In an interview, Altaylı told the newspaper that the monastery belonged to his grandfather and he inherited it from his father. The monastery was confiscated during the Armenian Genocide. A group of Armenians in Turkey, led by the activist Nadya Uygun, started a petition asking him to [...] "Apply to the Armenian Patriarchate of Turkey and transfer the <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> of the church to the concerned [...] foundation." [...] Altayli told Agos that he is ready to give it to the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, but no government authority has approached him to respond to his offer to give back the church to its owners, and that they displayed no interest in cooperating. Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (DSİP) activists demonstrated in early October 2012 before the Habertürk headquarters in Beyoğlu, Istanbul demanding the return of the monastery land to the Armenians. As of September 2014, there was no progress. In 2017 it was documented that the Turkish government actively tried to tear the stones of what remains from the monastery to construct a mosque, houses and other developments in the area.|$|E
500|$|It was in Indianapolis that Ruth Hoskins {{learned the}} game, {{and took it}} back to Atlantic City. After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names and railroads, and taught it {{to a group of}} local Quakers. It has been argued that their {{greatest}} contribution to the game was to reinstate the original Lizzie Magie rule of [...] "buying properties at their listed price" [...] rather than auctioning them, as the Quakers did not believe in auctions. Another source states that the Quakers simply [...] "didn't like the noise of the auctioneering." [...] Among the group taught the game by Hoskins were Eugene Raiford and his wife, who took a copy of the game with Atlantic City street names to Philadelphia. Due to the Raifords' unfamiliarity with streets and properties in Philadelphia, the Atlantic City-themed version was the one taught to Charles Todd, who in turn taught Esther Darrow, wife of Charles Darrow. After learning the game, Darrow then began to distribute the game himself as Monopoly and never spoke to the Todds again. Darrow initially made the sets of the Monopoly game by hand {{with the help of his}} first son, William Darrow, and his wife. Their new sets retained Charles Todd's misspelling of [...] "Marvin Gardens" [...] and the renaming of the Shore Fast Line the Short Line. Charles Darrow drew the designs with a drafting pen on round pieces of oilcloth, and then his son and his wife helped fill in the spaces with colors and make the <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> cards and the Chance cards and Community Chest cards. After the demand for the game increased, Darrow contacted a printing company, Patterson and White, which printed the designs of the property spaces on square carton boards. Darrow's game board designs included elements later made famous in the version eventually produced by Parker Brothers, including black locomotives on the railroad spaces, the car on [...] "Free Parking", the red arrow for [...] "Go", the faucet on [...] "Water Works", the light bulb on [...] "Electric Company", and the question marks on the [...] "Chance" [...] spaces, though many of the actual icons were created by a hired graphic artist. While Darrow received a copyright on his game in 1933, its specimens have disappeared from the files of the United States Copyright Office, though proof of its registration remains.|$|E

2500|$|Dominica is {{the only}} Eastern Caribbean island that still has a {{population}} of pre-Columbian native Caribs, who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands. [...] The Caribs on Dominica fought against the Spanish and later European settlers for two centuries. [...] Over time, however, their population declined and they were forced into remote regions of the island as European settlers and imported African slaves grew in number on the island. [...] The first reservation of land for the Carib people occurred in 1763, when [...] of mountainous land and rocky shoreline around Salybia, on the east coast, were set aside by British colonial authorities as part of the surveying of the island and its division into lots. [...] A legend arose that this land was set aside by the request of Queen Charlotte, the wife of George III; from this another legend spread, and persisted among some Carib to the present, that Charlotte had set aside half of Dominica for the Carib people. [...] Later colonial officials were unable to locate any record of a <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> for the , however. [...] European settlers continued attempts to turn the Carib lands into plantations {{through the end of the}} 18th century, but the Caribs successfully held out, often with the assistance of runaway slaves.|$|E
2500|$|Statements of {{equitable}} principle stretch {{back to the}} Ancient Greeks in {{the work}} of Aristotle, while examples of rules analogous to trusts were found in the Roman law testamentary institution of the fideicommissum, and the Islamic proprietary institution of the Waqf. [...] However, English trusts law is a largely indigenous development that began in the Middle Ages, {{from the time of the}} 11th and 12th century crusades. After William the Conqueror became King in 1066, one [...] "common law" [...] of England was created. Common law courts regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been under Roman law and continental versions of civil law. During the crusades, landowners who went to fight would transfer title to their land to a person they trusted so that feudal services could be performed and received. But many who returned found that the people they entrusted refused to transfer their <b>title</b> <b>deed</b> back. Sometimes, common law courts would not acknowledge that anybody had rights in the property except the holder of the legal title deeds. So claimants petitioned the King to sidestep the common law courts. The King delegated hearing of petitions to his Lord Chancellor, who established the Court of Chancery as more cases were heard. Where it appeared [...] "inequitable" [...] (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto land, the Lord Chancellor could declare that the real owner [...] "in equity" [...] (i.e. in all fairness) was another person, if this is what good conscience dictated. The Court of Chancery determined that the true [...] "use" [...] or [...] "benefit" [...] of property did not belong to the person on the title (or the feoffee who held seisin). The cestui que use, the owner in equity, could be a different person. So English law recognised a split between legal and equitable owner, between someone who controlled title and another for whose benefit the land would be used. It was the beginning of trust law. The same logic was useful for Franciscan friars, who would transfer title of land to others as they were precluded from holding property by their vows of poverty. When the courts said that one person's legal title to property was subject to an obligation to use that property for another person, there was a trust.|$|E

30|$|The {{livelihood}} changes {{associated with}} enclosures depend {{on an ongoing}} privatization of land. Officially, land is registered under different statutory and customary tenure through individual <b>title</b> <b>deeds,</b> group ranches, trust land and government land. While the upper areas of Chepareria hold individual <b>title</b> <b>deeds,</b> the group ranches and trust land of the lower areas have and continuously continue to be sub-divided into privately enclosed land based on informal contractual agreements to secure their properties. On group ranches, residents are registered under group ranch <b>title</b> <b>deeds</b> that officially imply legitimate access to the whole group ranch land. However, as people have sub-divided and privatized group ranches with informal ownership agreements, people {{are not allowed to}} trespass on private properties and the enclosures work effectively as a demarcation of this property. The same conditions apply on trust land that is officially registered to allow for traditional communal tenure practices.|$|R
