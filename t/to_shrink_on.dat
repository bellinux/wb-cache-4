50|$|Crease {{formation}} in woven or knitted fabric composed of cellulose during washing or folding {{is the main}} drawback of cotton fabrics. The molecular chains of the cotton fibers are attached with each other by weak hydrogen bonds. During washing or folding, the hydrogen bonds break easily and after drying new hydrogen bonds form with the chains in their new position and the creases are stabilized. If crosslinking between the polymer chains can be introduced by crosslinking chemicals, then it reinforces the cotton fibers and prevents the permanent displacement of the polymer chains when the fibers are stressed. It is therefore much more difficult for creases to form or for the fabric <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>on</b> washing.|$|E

On August 9, Genevieve started to move in a northward direction, towards low to moderate vertical windshear. Later that day, the JTWC downgraded the system to a category 3 typhoon.

40|$|Creating highly {{articulated}} miniature structures requires {{assembling a}} large number of small parts. This is a very challenging task and increases cost of mechanical assemblies. Insert molding presents the possibility of creating a highly articulated structure in a single molding step. This can be accomplished by placing multiple metallic bearings in the mold and injecting plastic on top of them. In theory, this idea can generate a multi degree of freedom structures in just one processing step without requiring any post molding assembly operations. However, the polymer material has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>on</b> top of the metal bearings and hence jam the joints.

40|$|It is {{generally}} thought that conservative mass transfer in Algol binaries causes their orbits to be wider, {{in which the}} less massive star overflows its Roche-lobe. The observed decrease in the orbital periods of some Algol binaries suggests orbital angular momentum loss during the binary evolution, and the magnetic braking mechanism is often invoked to explain the observed orbital shrinkage. Here we suggest an alternative explanation, assuming that {{a small fraction of}} the transferred mass forms a circumbinary disk, which extracts orbital angular momentum from the binary through tidal torques. We also perform numerical calculations of the evolution of Algol binaries with typical initial masses and orbital periods. The results indicate that, for reasonable input parameters, the circumbinary disk can significantly influence the orbital evolution, and cause the orbit <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>on</b> a sufficiently long timescale. Rapid mass transfer in Algol binaries with low mass ratios can also be accounted for in this scenario. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

Oxygen holes interacting with the wall form singlets, protect themselves against other holes by an incompressible "spin fence'', and thus interact also with the lattice.

40|$|The Island Rule is the {{observed}} tendency for island isolated animals to either grow or shrink in size {{compared to their}} mainland counterparts. Though the phenomenon was initially observed to only occur {{in a handful of}} taxa (carnivores, artiodactyls, rodents, and lagomorphs), it was expanded to include 2 major trends: 1) Large animals from the mainland tend <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>on</b> islands, and 2) Small animals from the mainland tend to grow. The mechanisms attributed to those two trends generally involved factors that include resource availability, ecological release, niche expansion, predation, competition, and life history traits. Other theories were also proposed, but each had their own caveats that did not apply as a general rule. The study of the island rule, and island biogeography in general, allows a simplified view of dynamics that may possibly be reflected on mainlands. An example of this includes ecological release and niche expansion in the case of mammals following the Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction event. Following the collapse of dinosaurian prevalence, the relatively small mammals were given the opportunity to grow and speciate accordingly. However, upon further observation, the island rule in its generality did not encompass all fauna, and exceptions were found for the insular trend. Bergmann’s rule of latitudinal differentiation for body sizes, as well as general climate change, have been found to potentially influence body size shifts as well. As a result, some have chosen to strip the Island Rule of its status as a virtual law, and instead explain the trend as being a phenomenon greatly affected by both biotic and abiotic components to determine insular body size. Regardless of the specific definition, it is maintained that a strong understanding of island processes may lend a better understanding of mainland developmental ecology and evolution...|$|E
40|$|PMSP (Polymer Metal Solvent Paste) {{material}} must be {{deposited on}} a five inch wafer with 100 % bump survival. The target geometry is 0. 010 {double_prime} diameter, and 0. 004 {double_prime} high {{with a flat}} surface. Accomplishments: The photobumping process has been refined to yield bumps that are 0. 010 {double_prime} in diameter and greater than 0. 0035 {double_prime} high. The surface is flat and bonding results in a strong bond with no air entrapment between the chip bump and card pad. Initial work with photobumping yielded a bump surface that was concave. In photobumping, 0. 004 {double_prime} thick photoresist is imaged to create apertures. These apertures are filled with PMSP in two passes with a solvent drying process that occurs {{between the first and}} the second pass After the first pass filling, solvent from the PM SP interacted with the photoresist and caused the top surface, at the circumference of the aperture, <b>to</b> <b>shrink.</b> <b>On</b> the second pass filling, this slightly depressed surface fills up with PM SP. We call this blooming because the diameter of the bump is extended at the surface. When the photoresist is stripped, the thin surface extension of the bump diameter is folded over on top of the bump. This fold created a ridge at the circumference of the bump that would make initial contact with the card surface during bonding. The result was a high probability of air entrapment at the joint interface. The blooming problem was corrected by changing from an aqueous to a semiaqueous photorcsist that was more solvent resistant. Flat surface bumps are made with 100 % yield on five inch wafers. Double layers of 0. 002 {double_prime} photoresist are used to define the nearly 0. 004 {double_prime} high bumps. Work is in progress to use single layers of 0. 003 {double_prime} and 0. 004 {double_prime} photoresist.
