With the subsequent completion of the Western Ring Road joining the West Gate Interchange to the freeway's west and CityLink to the freeway's east, it also funnels traffic from northern and western suburbs around Melbourne, acting as a bypass freeway.|$|E
40|$|During {{architectural}} design, {{the architect}} {{has to come}} up with a set of design decisions that in combination guarantee the fulfillment of non-functional requirements. One type of design decision is related to inter-component communication patterns captured <b>through</b> <b>connector</b> designs. Since connectors potentially impact big portions of a system, they are likely to be influenced by nonfunctional concerns in form of architectural tactics. In fact, decomposing connector designs along non-functional dimensions enables separation of concerns, however, the composition (or synthesis) of architectural tactics potentially yields incorrect connector models caused by so-called tactic interactions. In this paper, we describe an approach for detecting such interactions in connector designs during tactic synthesis. We extend existing work by formally defining, modeling, and checking compositional semantics of architectural tactics. Technically, we apply fluent linear temporal logic in order to capture and to model check desired properties automatically. Our approach is integrated in a commercial architecture design tool supporting automated interaction detection during connector design activities...|$|E
40|$|The {{abstract}} {{is being}} passed through STIMS for submision to the conference. International safeguards organizations charged with promoting the peaceful {{use of nuclear}} energy employ unattended and remote monitoring systems supplemented with onsite inspections to ensure nuclear materials are not diverted for weaponization purposes. These systems are left unattended for periods of several months between inspections. During these periods physical security means are the main deterrent used to detect intentional monitoring system tampering. The information gathering components are locked in secure and sealed rooms. The sensor components (i. e. neutron and gamma detectors) are located throughout the plant in unsecure areas where sensor tampering could take place during the periods between inspections. Sensor tampering could allow the diversion of nuclear materials from the accepted and intended use to uses {{not consistent with the}} peaceful use of nuclear energy. A method and an apparatus is presented that address the detection of sensor tampering during the periods between inspections. It was developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for the Department of Energy (DOE) in support of the IAEA. The method is based on the detailed analysis of the sensor noise floor after the sensor signal is removed. The apparatus consists of a 2. 1 ” x 2. 6 ” electronic circuit board containing all signal conditioning and processing components and a laptop computer running an application that acquires and stores the analysis results between inspection periods. The sensors do not require any modification and are remotely located in their normal high radiation zones. The apparatus interfaces with the sensor signal conductors using a simple pass <b>through</b> <b>connector</b> at the normal sensor electronics interface package located in the already secure and sealed rooms. The apparatus does not require hardening against the effects of radiation due to its location. Presented is the apparatus design, the analysis method, and the test results as applied to tamper detection using three HE 3 neutron sensors and two gamma sensors designed and built for safeguards monitoring...|$|E

50|$|Once dry, {{the plates}} are stacked with {{suitable}} separators and inserted {{in a cell}} container. The alternate plates then constitute alternating positive and negative electrodes, and within the cell are later connected to one another (negative to negative, positive to positive) in parallel. The separators inhibit the plates from touching each other, which would otherwise constitute a short circuit. In flooded and gel cells, the separators are insulating rails or studs, formerly of glass or ceramic, and now of plastic. In AGM cells, the separator is the glass mat itself, and the rack of plates with separators are squeezed together before insertion into the cell; once in the cell, the glass mats expand slightly, effectively locking the plates in place. In multi-cell batteries, the cells are then connected {{to one another in}} series, either <b>through</b> <b>connectors</b> <b>through</b> the cell walls, or by a bridge over the cell walls.

40|$|A cross axis {{wind turbine}} is disclosed, which {{comprises}} of cross axis arrangement. The wind turbine {{consists of three}} vertical blades and six horizontal blades arranged in cross axis orientation. The six horizontal blades serve as the radial arms that link the three vertical blades and the hubs <b>through</b> <b>connectors</b> to form the cross axis wind turbine (CAWT). Three horizontal axis blades that make up as the upper radial arm connects the top part of the vertical blades to the hub <b>through</b> the top <b>connectors.</b> The other three horizontal axis blades that make up as the lower radial arm connects the bottom part of the vertical axis blades to the hub <b>through</b> the bottom <b>connectors.</b> To avoid air flow blockage or interference between the top radial arm and the bottom radial arm, the horizontal axis blade radial arm at the top part of the turbine is offset at an angle of 30 Â° {{with respect to the}} bottom radial arm. In the present invention, the air stream can be channeled {{from the bottom of the}} turbine through the bottom radial arm, and the air streams that did not interact with the bottom radial arm will eventually interact with the top radial arm. The air streams channeled from the bottom of the wind turbine and moving upwards will interact with the horizontal blades and this will eventually improve the self-starting capability of the CAWT.

40|$|Introduction R-RIO (Reflective-Reconfigurable Interconnectable Objects) is a {{distributed}} {{programming environment}} that integrates some key concepts of Configuration (CP) and Reflective Programming (RP) approaches [1]. This integration helps to achieve separation of concerns and improve software reuse. In addition, {{the capability of}} supporting dynamic configuration and flexibility on component programming language choice are potentially improved. In this position paper, we highlight how reflection is used in three distinct fashions in R-RIO. In a first form, reflection is used to reason about application architectures built {{with the support of}} R-RIO. In this form, one can instantiate applications with customized architectures and dynamically adapt their architectures to new requirements. In a second form, computational reflection is used <b>through</b> <b>connectors</b> to allow the addition of nonstrictly -functional aspects, such as distribution, coordination, fault-tolerance and QoS support to ap...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of configuration-based programming, focusing primarily on associated formal methods aimed at easing the development of correct distributed applications. Briefly stated, configuration-based programming consists of describing an application using a configuration that defines interconnections between software components <b>through</b> <b>connectors</b> characterizing communication protocols. Existing work in the field of formal specification of configurations allows to verify that the interconnections of components are correct with respect to both the functional behaviors of components and the use of protocols within components. In addition, we discuss a way to specify nonfunctional properties provided by configuration elements, hence allowing to reason about the application behavior from the standpoint of resource management policies implemented by the underlying (distributed) runtime system. 1 Introduction The ever increasing complexity of distributed applications c [...] ...|$|R

The Olan project [18] investigates a "programming in the large" approach that allows the specification of applications as hierarchies of interacting components, glued together <b>through</b> <b>connectors,</b> which are agents specialized in communication and coordination tasks. However we face the difficulty of defining an operational semantics able to reflect the diversity of execution models involved in real applications: the coordination of active as well as passive entities, the need for various communication schemes (synchronous and asynchronous) and the encoding of complex interconnection graphs make the use of available theories difficult. Indeed, existing process calculi (as CSP[6] and especially CCS[9], -calculus [11]) offer the required abstractions such as encapsulation and process equivalences, but they re [...] ...|$|R
