5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard around the building during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>As</b> the crowd neared the building, the police opened fire.

5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large garage door was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E

No offers to continue operating <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E

When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Hope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra. Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> Pym and van Dyne escape.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Louis in 1979, the Horch family sold the Master Building to a real estate investor, Sol Goldman, {{who was then the}} city's largest private landlord.

5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close {{that it is difficult}} to see the full exterior of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> was once possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had been added to <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> <b>as</b> well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994, the Great Southern Hotel {{ended its}} {{operations}} from <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> the hotel faced increasing {{competition in the}} hospitality industry.

The other seven existing tenants of the building vacated their businesses after the building was sold, and were each paid a compensation sum.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement {{was applied to the}} {{external}} faces of the mosque with the intention of protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E
5|$|Manampisoa {{was one of}} the {{residence}}s of queens Rasoherina, RanavalonaII and RanavalonaIII, {{the last}} three monarchs of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Once complete, Manampisoa was used by Rasoherina as her primary residence but the queen was only able to inhabit the house for approximately one year before dying in April 1868. After Rasoherina's death, her successor, RanavalonaII, used <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> a temporary worship space during work on the stone chapel. Upon the collapse of the monarchy following French colonisation, the colonial authority transformed Manampisoa into a museum of Malagasy culture.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank Building {{was placed}} on the National Register of Historic Places.

5|$|On June 30, 2003, {{the current}} {{building}} {{was placed on}} the National Register of Historic Places. The listing of the building coincided with the structure's 75th anniversary. The immediate past location of the school, on Howard Street in downtown Baltimore, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On April 24, 2007, the building was designated a Baltimore City landmark, which means that the building's exterior cannot be altered without approval of the city Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation. On June 21, 2007, the school's Alumni Association received a historic preservation award from Baltimore Heritage for its leadership role in preserving <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> an historic Baltimore landmark.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1891, University Hall, the school's first brick {{building}}, {{caught on}} fire. As {{a result of}} the fire the top two floors of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> well as the roof were destroyed. The building was then re-built after the 1891 fire, but unlike the original plans it was constructed with a Mansard style roof. Additionally, a square tower was also built on top in lieu of the original cupola which included a school bell. From its construction until 1987, Waller Hall was used as an academic hall and hosted classes along with housing the school's chapel and as offices for the faculty.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the removal}} of the reactor in October 2008, the {{university}} proposed demolishing the structure and redeveloping the site for other uses.

Preservationists suggested re-using <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>as</b> a museum dedicated to the state's nuclear history and continuing research. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, based on an application from UW architecture student Abby Inpanbutr (then Abby Martin) submitted in spring 2008.|$|E
