40|$|Ptx 1 {{belongs to}} an {{expanding}} family of bicoid-related vertebrate homeobox genes. These genes, like their Drosophila homolog, seem {{to play a}} role in the development of anterior structures and, in particular, the brain and facies. We report the chromosomal localization of mouse Ptx 1, and the cloning, sequencing, and chromosomal localization of the human homolog PTX 1. The putative encoded proteins share 100 % homology in the homeodomain and are 88 % and 97 % conserved in the N- and C-termini respectively. Intron/exon boundaries are also conserved. Murine Ptx 1 was localized, by interspecific backcrossing, to Chr 13 within 2. 6 cM of Caml. The gene resides centrally on Chromosome (Chr) 13 in a region syntenic with human Chr 5 q. Subsequent analysis by fluorescent in situ hybridization places the human gene, PTX 1, on 5 q 31, a region associated with <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> Franceschetti <b>Syndrome.</b> Taken together with the craniofacial expression pattern of Ptx 1 during early development, the localization of the gene in this chromosomal area is consistent with an involvement in <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> Franceschetti <b>Syndrome...</b>|$|R
40|$|Genotyping with {{flanking}} DNA markers {{was used}} to ascertain <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> Franceschetti <b>syndrome</b> (TCOF 1) in a subject affected by tetralogy of Fallot and cryptorchidism. The proband's family consisted of a father and sister who were affected by the disease, and a healthy mother. Since cardiac malformation and cryptorchidism {{have been associated with}} the TCOF 1 syndrome, the proband was suspected to be a carrier of the mutated gene. Microsatellite markers D 5 S 527, SPARC and D 5 S 519, which previously mapped the TCOF 1 gene within a 2. 1 -cM interval on chromosome 5 (5 q 32 - 33. 1), were used to follow the transmission of the TCOF 1 mutated locus. Flanking markers D 5 S 519 and D 5 S 527 were informative and enabled us to exclude inheritance of a TCOF 1 mutation to the proband, while showing that cardiac malformation and cryptorchidism were unrelated in this patient...|$|R
40|$|The term "craniofacial {{anomalies}} " (CFAs) {{refers to}} {{a diverse group of}} congenital disorders including complex syndromes marked by multiple sutural fusions (e. g., Crouzan's, <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins,</b> and Aperts <b>syndromes),</b> simple craniosyn-ostoses involving single fusions (e. g., sagittal synostosis), hemifacial micro-somia, clefts of the lip and/or palate, and isolated "birth marks " on the face and neck, such as benign vascular nevi (i. e., port-wine stains). Most children with these disorders experience one or more associated complications including feed-ing and growth difficulties, oral-dental problems, chronic ear infections, speech and language impairments, and multiple structural and cosmetic surgeries for both visible disfigurement and "invisible " dysmorphologies (e. g., cleft palate). Any or all of these factors may produce significant stress and conflict for the child and family. Various psychological risk factors have been identified that may compro-mise the child's psychological adjustment, such as parental guilt or overprotec-tiveness, stigmatizing social responses to speech impairment or facial disfigure-ment, and certain neuropsychological limitations (see Barden, 1990; Richman & Eliason, 1993, for reviews of this literature).

50|$|Individuals with <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{often have}} both cleft palate and hearing loss, in {{addition}} to other disabilities. Hearing loss is often secondary to absent, small, or unusually formed ears (microtia), and commonly results from malformations of the middle ear. Researchers have found that most patients with <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> have symmetric external ear canal abnormalities and symmetrically dysmorphic or absent ossicles in the middle ear space. Inner ear structure is largely normal. Most patients show a moderate hearing impairment or greater, and the type of loss is generally a conductive hearing loss. Patients with <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> exhibit hearing losses similar to those of patients with malformed or missing ossicles (Pron et al., 1993).|$|E

50|$|Other {{diseases}} {{have similar}} characteristics to <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In the differential diagnosis, one {{should consider the}} acrofacial dysostoses. The facial appearance resembles that of <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but additional limb abnormalities occur in those persons. Examples of these diseases are Nager syndrome and Miller syndrome.The oculoauriculovertebral spectrum should also {{be considered in the}} differential diagnosis. An example is hemifacial microsomia, which primarily affects development of the ear, mouth, and mandible. This anomaly may occur bilaterally. Another disease which belongs to this spectrum is Goldenhar syndrome, which includes vertebral abnormalities, epibulbar dermoids and facial deformities.|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis includes <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Nager acrofacial dysostosis (preaxial cranial dysostosis).

50|$|Symptoms {{in people}} with <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> vary. Some {{individuals}} are so mildly affected that they remain undiagnosed, while others have severe facial involvement and life-threatening airway compromise. Most {{of the features of}} TCS are symmetrical and are already recognisable at birth. The most common symptom of <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins</b> <b>syndrome</b> is underdevelopment of the lower jaw and underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone. This can be accompanied by the tongue being retracted. The small mandible can result in a poor occlusion of the teeth or in more severe cases, trouble breathing or swallowing. Underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone gives the cheeks a sunken appearance.|$|E

50|$|Nager acrofacial {{dysostosis}} is a {{congenital anomaly}} syndrome.Nager syndrome displays several {{or all of}} the following characteristics: underdevelopment of the cheek and jaw area, down-sloping of the opening of the eyes, lack or absence of the lower eyelashes, kidney or stomach reflux, hammer toes, shortened soft palate, petite, lack of development of the internal and external ear, possible cleft palate, underdevelopment or absence of the thumb, hearing loss (see hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes) and shortened forearms, as well as poor movement in the elbow, and may be characterized by accessory tragi. Occasionally sufferers develop vertebral anomalies such as scoliosis and sufferers do not usually have problems with their reproductive organs. The inheritance pattern said to be autosomal but there are arguments as to whether it is autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Most cases tend to be sporadic. Nager syndrome is also linked to five other similar syndromes: Miller <b>syndrome,</b> <b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins,</b> Pierre Robin, Genee-Wiedemann, and Franceschetti-Zwahlen-Klein.|$|R
40|$|Hypothyroidism {{is due to}} {{deficient}} thyroid function; myxoedema is due to diminished thyroid function {{associated with}} solid oedema. Since hypothyroidism develops very gradually and not all cases exhibit solid oedema, diagnosis is very often missed. As the incidence of this condition {{is more common in}} females than males and the age at onset corresponds to that of the menopause, diagnosis is very often confused with the meno-pausal syndrome or symptoms attributable to old age. Hypothyroidism may occur spontaneously in middle age or be associated with goitre, thyroidectomy, or radioactive iodine treatment. Clinically, the ocular complications of hypothyroidism are loss of eyelashes and eye brows, especially on the temporal side, puffiness of eyelids (Gull, I 874), ocular irritation, corneal changes (<b>Treacher</b> <b>Collins,</b> I 907), and cataract (Goulden, I 928). In the past 2 years, six patients with previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism presented at the Bath Eye Infirmary with various ocular complaints.

40|$|Purpose—To {{report the}} use of a semiburied {{curvilinear}} distraction device, with a 3 -D CT treatment planning system, for correction of mandibular deformities. Methods—This is a retrospective evaluation of 13 consecutive patients, with syndromic and non-syndromic micrognathia, who underwent correction by curvilinear distraction osteogenesis. A 3 -D CT scan was obtained for each patient and imported into a 3 -D treatment planning system (Slicer/ Osteoplan™). Surgical guides were constructed to localize the osteotomy and to drill holes for securing the distractor’s proximal and distal footplates to the mandible. Postoperatively, patients were followed by clinical examination and plain radiographs to ensure the desired vector of movement. At end distraction, when possible, a 3 -D CT scan was obtained to document the final mandibular position. Results—Eight females and 5 males {{with a mean age of}} 11. 9 years (range= 15 months– 39 years) underwent bilateral mandibular curvilinear distraction. Eight of the 13 patients were 16 years or younger and 5 were less than 6 years of age.

An additional homologous motif was detected in a gene product fused to the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 in patients with an atypical stem cell myeloproliferative disorder. In total, over 100 eukaryotic intracellular proteins are shown to possess a LIS 1 homology (LisH) motif, including several katanin p 60 subunits, muskelin, tonneau, LEUNIG, Nopp 140, aimless and numerous WD repeat-containing beta-propeller proteins. It is suggested that LisH motifs contribute to the regulation of microtubule dynamics, either by mediating dimerization, or else by binding cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain or microtubules directly. The predicted secondary structure of LisH motifs, and their occurrence in homologues of Gbeta beta-propeller subunits, suggests that they are analogues of Ggamma subunits, and might associate with the periphery of beta-propeller domains. The finding of LisH motifs in both treacle and Nopp 140 reinforces previous observations of functional similarities between these nucleolar proteins. Uncharacterized LisH motif-containing proteins represent candidates for other diseases associated with aberrant microtubule dynamics and defects of cell migration, nucleokinesis or chromosome segregation...|$|R
