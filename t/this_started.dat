5|$|Another form of airpower {{employed}} by Kenney was air transport. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> in September 1942 when {{troops of the}} 32nd Infantry Division were airlifted from Australia to Port Moresby. Later in the campaign, C-47 Dakotas landed Australian troops at Wanigela. A year later, American paratroops landed at Nadzab, enabling the Australian 7th Division to be flown in.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez's sister, Gladys, {{worked for}} Ernest Lawrence as a {{part-time}} secretary, and mentioned Alvarez to Lawrence. Lawrence then invited Alvarez to tour the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago with him. After he completed his oral exams in 1936, Alvarez, now {{engaged to be married}} to Geraldine Smithwick, asked his sister to see if Lawrence had any jobs available at the Radiation Laboratory. A telegram soon arrived from Gladys with a job offer from Lawrence. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> a long association with the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez and Smithwick were married in one of the chapels at the University of Chicago and then headed for California. They had two children, Walter and Jean. They were divorced in 1957. On December 28, 1958, he married Janet L. Landis, and had two more children, Donald and Helen.|$|E

5|$|Edward was crowned at age {{fourteen}} {{after his}} father was deposed by his mother, Isabella of France, and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> {{what became known as}} the Hundred Years' War. Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.|$|E
5|$|In 1527 King Henry VIII asked Pope Clement VII to annul his {{marriage}} to Katherine of Aragon, but the pope refused. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> {{a series of events}} known as English Reformation in which Henry broke away from the authority of the pope. In lieu of the pope, Henry assumed authority over the church: all priests and religious figures, including monks, were required to swear support to the royal supremacy over the church. Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey acknowledged the king's royal supremacy on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E

5|$|In those years, Gaddafi's support {{had been}} mostly moral, {{with only a}} limited supply of weapons. All <b>this</b> <b>started</b> {{changing}} in February 1977, when the Libyans provided Oueddei's men with hundreds of AK-47 assault rifles, dozens of RPGs, 81 and 82mm mortars and recoilless cannons. Armed with these weapons, the FAP attacked in June the Chadian Armed Forces' (FAT) strongholds of Bardaï and Zouar in Tibesti and of Ounianga Kébir in Borkou. Oueddei took full control of the Tibesti with this attack after Bardaï, besieged since 22 June, surrendered on 4 July, while Zouar was evacuated. The FAT lost 300 men, and piles of military supplies fell {{into the hands of}} the rebels. Ounianga was attacked on 20 June, but was saved by the French military advisors present there.|$|E
5|$|John VI died in Lisbon in 1826. His elder son Peter, who had {{declared}} {{the independence of}} Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Peter I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Peter IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Peter abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Peter stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> {{the period of the}} Liberal Wars.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E

5|$|The 1966–67 season proved {{frustrating}} for United, despite {{the introduction of}} another club great {{in the form of}} Eddie Gray. Leeds finished fourth, five points behind champions Manchester United, and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals after defeat to Chelsea. They made progress in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, beating DWS (Netherlands), Valencia, Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the final, where they were beaten 2–0 on aggregate by Yugoslavian outfit Dinamo Zagreb. At {{the end of the season}} he was named as the Footballer of the Year, succeeding his brother who had won it the previous year. During the award ceremony he told a number of amusing stories and won a standing ovation from the crowd, <b>this</b> <b>started</b> him on a successful sideline as an after-dinner speaker.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy {{ended the}} Civil War with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s {{most of these}} were laid up in reserve, leaving the USA {{virtually}} without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw {{the beginning of what}} became the Great White Fleet, and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War of 1898. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> a new era of naval warfare.|$|E
5|$|Two venues, Kristins Hall and Hafjell, {{were built}} before Lillehammer had been awarded the Olympics, {{although}} the former was only used for training during the Olympics. Lillehammer's incumbent ski jumping hill, Balbergbakken, {{was found to}} be unsuitable and Lysgårdsbakken was built instead. In the bid, the speed skating events were to be held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> a debate about the location of the various ice rinks and resulted in the neighboring towns of Hamar and Gjøvik also receiving venues.|$|E

5|$|Upon its discovery, the Astronomica was read, commented upon, {{and edited}} {{by a number}} of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become as popular as other {{classical}} Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> to change during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist A. E. Housman published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in five books. Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider the Astronomica to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory; at the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate complex mathematical computations into poetic verse.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 CAHL season, Ottawa and the Montreal Victorias both {{finished}} {{in first place}} with 6–2 records. The top scorers were the Victorias' Russell Bowie, who scored seven goals in one game and six in another, and McGee, whose top performance saw him score five goals in a game. The two clubs faced off in a two-game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup. The first game, played in Montreal on slushy ice that made it a desperate struggle to score, ended 1–1. The return match in Ottawa, witnessed by three thousand fans, was on ice coated with an inch of water. The conditions did not hinder Ottawa, as they won 8–0, with McGee scoring three goals and the other five shared among the three Gilmour brothers, Dave (3), Suddy (1) and Bill (1), to win their first Cup. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> {{a period in which}} the team held the Stanley Cup and defeated all challengers until March 1906.|$|E
5|$|Narvesen had an {{exclusive}} agreement with NSB to operate newsagent's shops at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended {{to create a}} foundation to obtain the company; when plans for <b>this</b> <b>started</b> in 1972, they had difficulties {{finding a way to}} transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if {{it was part of a}} restructuring. A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 Fritt Ord was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the Conservative Party and Progress Party voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen–Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Olimpija won {{the first}} title. They had a long {{tradition}} of playing in the Yugoslav first league and their squad was still composed of players from that era. Olimpija dominated the league and won a further three championships before Gorica won their first in the 1995–96 season. Following Gorica's success, Maribor won their first championship in 1997. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> a record-breaking streak of seven successive league championships which came to an end when Gorica won their second title in the 2003–04 season. The club from Nova Gorica went on to win an additional two titles, becoming the third club to win three consecutive championships. During the 2006–07 season Domžale, a club that played in the Slovenian second division three seasons earlier, won their first title, a feat they repeated the next season. Following the 2008–09 season, Maribor became the dominant force in Slovenian football for the second time, having won six out of eight championships since then.|$|E
5|$|Other {{visitors}} {{stayed to}} prospect for and mine deposits of copper, gold, lead, and silver. These sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment. In December 1903, two men from Ballarat were prospecting for silver. One was an out-of-work Irish miner named Jack Keane {{and the other}} was a one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren. Quite by accident, Keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo's work site and named the claim the Keane Wonder Mine. <b>This</b> <b>started</b> a minor and short-lived gold rush into the area. The Keane Wonder Mine, along with mines at Rhyolite, Skidoo and Harrisburg, were the only ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile. Outright shams such as Leadfield also occurred, but most ventures quickly ended after a short series of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore (these mines now dot the entire area and are a significant hazard to anyone who enters them). The boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the 1900s (decade) but soon declined after the Panic of 1907.|$|E

The telemetry station received investments of NOK100 million during the 1980s and was organized as a foundation in 1984. It took the name Tromsø Satellite Station in 1988. Part of the goal of the project was to create technical spin-offs; the one successful company was Spacetec, which had 45 employees {{at the time it was}} bought by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace in 1994.
