5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a unit and its realisation. <b>The</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> each base {{unit of the}} SI is drawn up {{so that it is}} unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this change {{is that the new}} definition makes <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the kelvin depend on the definitions of the second, the metre, and the kilogram.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> following, <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IEC {{standard}} will be preferred and {{in important}} cases compared with <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EIA standard.|$|R
25|$|For <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> a {{ring and}} basic {{concepts}} and their properties, see ring (mathematics). <b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> terms used throughout ring theory {{may be found}} in the glossary of ring theory.|$|R
5000|$|Specializing <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> [...] "-regular" [...] and [...] "zero divisor on [...] " [...] to {{the case}} [...] recovers <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> [...] "regular" [...] and [...] "zero divisor" [...] given earlier in this article.|$|R
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this change {{is that the new}} definition makes <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram dependent on the definitions of the second and the metre.|$|E
5|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} 'How many Sudoku grids are there?' depends on <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> when similar solutions are considered different.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> {{capacitance}} (C) is {{the charge}} (Q) stored per unit voltage (V).|$|E
25|$|Both the plaintiffs' {{counsel and}} the defendant's counsel {{made use of}} the dictionaries. The plaintiffs' counsel read in {{evidence}} from the same dictionaries <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word tomato, while the defendant's counsel then read in evidence from Webster's Dictionary <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words pea, eggplant, cucumber, squash, and pepper. Countering this, the plaintiff then read in evidence from Webster's and Worcester's dictionaries <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> potato, turnip, parsnip, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and bean.|$|R
30|$|For n= 2, Definitions 2.9 and 2.10 yield <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> coupled {{fixed point}} and coupled {{coincidence}} point respectively {{while on the}} other hand, for n= 4 these <b>definitions</b> yield <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> quadrupled fixed point and quadrupled coincidence point respectively.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{application}} classes {{given in the}} two standards are different. The following table shows <b>the</b> different <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{application classes}} for ceramic capacitors: ...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> exponentiation can be {{extended}} to allow any real or complex exponent. Exponentiation by integer exponents can also be defined {{for a wide variety}} of algebraic structures, including matrices.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> real {{numbers as}} Dedekind cuts was first {{published}} by Richard Dedekind in 1872.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} division {{identifies the}} following code entity and contains <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a class or interface.|$|E
3000|$|... in (0, N + 1]. This {{shows that}} <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> n 1 (λ) in (2.10) and (3.4) {{coincide}}, and <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> n 2 (λ) in (2.16) and (3.5) coincide as well. The result then follows from Theorem 2.8 applied to eigenvalue problem (3.6).|$|R
30|$|Now we give <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> Besov spaces.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{decision}} impacts <b>definitions</b> used in Workforce Investment Act Title IB eligibility determinations. According to the decision, {{same-sex marriages}} {{must be included}} in <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> family, which in turn affects <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> eligible youth and displaced homemakers. Furthermore, the act only recognizes marriages that were already legal in their respective jurisdictions.|$|R
5|$|The {{proposed}} {{definition of}} the metre is effectively {{the same as the}} current definition, the only difference being that the additional rigour in <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the second will propagate to the metre.|$|E
5|$|This {{limit is}} plain if one understands <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> limit. So again 0.999...=1.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledging the problem, the IAU {{set about}} {{creating}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets {{dropped to the}} eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and {{a new class of}} dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).|$|E

5|$|Alan Stern {{has argued}} that {{location}} should not matter and that only geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account in <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it meets}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> outer space, the {{atmospheric}} density {{within the first}} few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the {{kilogram}} {{remained unchanged}} throughout the twentieth century, the 3rd CGPM in 1901 clarified that the kilogram was {{a unit of}} mass, not of weight. The original batch of 40 prototypes (adopted in 1889) were supplemented {{from time to time}} with further prototypes for use by new signatories to the Metre Convention.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{universal}} agreement on <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. Life may also {{be said to be}} simply the characteristic state of organisms.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the second relied on quantum theory, <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would {{tend to have a}} relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
