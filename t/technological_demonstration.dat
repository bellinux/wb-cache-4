50|$|Standard CubeSats {{are made}} up of 10×10×11.35 cm units {{designed}} to provide 10×10×10 cm or 1 liter of useful volume while weighing no more than 1.33 kg per unit. The smallest standard size is 1U, while 3U+ is the largest being composed of three units stacked lengthwise with an additional 6.4 cm diameter cylinder centered on the long axis and extending 3.6 cm beyond one face. The Aerospace Corporation has constructed and launched two smaller form CubeSats of 0.5U for radiation measurement and <b>technological</b> <b>demonstration.</b> In recent years larger CubeSat platforms have been proposed, most commonly 6U (10×20×30 cm or 12×24×36 cm) and 12U (20x20x30 cm or 24x24x36 cm), to extend the capabilities of CubeSats beyond academic and technology validation applications and into more complex science and national defense goals. In 2014 two 6U Perseus-M CubeSats were launched for maritime surveillance, those two CubeSats represent the largest CubeSats flown as of 2015. The 2018 launch of the InSight lander to Mars, will include two 6U CubeSats called Mars Cube One (MarCO).|$|E
50|$|The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) {{is part of}} the Aerospace Engineering Department and A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. The Space Systems Laboratory is {{centered}} on the Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility, a 50 ft, 25 ft neutral buoyancy pool used to simulate the microgravity environment of space. The only such facility housed at a university, Maryland's neutral buoyancy tank is used for undergraduate and graduate research at the Space Systems Lab. Research in Space Systems emphasizes space robotics, human factors, applications of artificial intelligence and the underlying fundamentals of space simulation. There are currently five robots being tested, including Ranger, a four-armed satellite repair robot, and SCAMP, a six-degree of freedom free-flying underwater camera platform. Ranger was funded by NASA starting in 1992, and was to be a <b>technological</b> <b>demonstration</b> of orbital satellite servicing. NASA was never able to manifest it for launch and the program was defunded circa 2006. For example, Ranger development work at the SSL continues, albeit at a slower pace; Ranger was used to demonstrate robotic servicing techniques for NASA's proposed robotic Hubble Servicing Mission.|$|E

Paradigm acted as a proponent of 3D computer graphics and virtual reality in the mid-1990s with its applications including the IRIS GL-based VisionWorks and the Performer-based Vega, which were used on Silicon Graphics workstations. Project sales for the company were $7 million in 1995, up from $3.5 million in 1994. During that time, the company frequented the annual Consumer Electronics Show, SIGGRAPH, and Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conferences with its 3D <b>technological</b> <b>demonstrations.</b>|$|R

40|$|Aircraft {{wings are}} usually {{optimized}} {{for a specific}} mission design point. However, since they operate {{in a wide variety}} of flight conditions, some of these have conflicting impacts on aircraft design process, as a single configuration may be efficient in one instance but perform poorly in others. A shape-shifting surface, or usually referred as 'morphing', potentially enables transport aircraft to reach maximum performance in any flight conditions. Within the framework of the Joint Technology Initiative Clean Sky (JTI-CS) project, and during the first phase of the Green Regional Aircraft Integrated <b>Technological</b> <b>Demonstration</b> (GRA-ITD), the authors focused on the design and <b>technological</b> <b>demonstration</b> of an innovative bi-modal morphing outer wing flap to be installed on the next generation open rotor green regional aircraft. A novel active rib layout was designed to enable the articulation of the entire flap structure by means of multi-box arrangement. In order to prove structural load-carrying capabilities with the reference to a relevant environment, the full-scale morphing flap was properly analyzed by means of detailed finite element model analysis. To the authors' knowledge, there is no morphing concept in literature based on a similar architecture based on distributed servo-mechanical actuators. Hence, a rational review of the potential problems associated with actuators off-design conditions has been conducted to investigate the maturity of the concept and safety issues concerning the flap ground static test. In addition, useful insights have been provided to effectively detect potential failure conditions in service...|$|E

Based on three cases of <b>technological</b> <b>demonstration</b> in the EU–CCS, smart grids, low carbon communities– it analyses the ways in which these demonstrations jointly construct their public, their object and the political principles that hold the two together. The analysis shows that there are significant democratic issues associated with these demonstrations.

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{introduces}} the aims and method of the book. It {{starts with the}} assumption that the current conduct of the energy transition raises issues of democracy and sets the book the task to address these by inquiring into actual energy transition processes. The chapter draws on the philosophy of pragmatism in outlining its inquiry, defined as an investigation based on a large set of case studies attending to the consequences of energy change processes so as to make these consequences explicit to actors. The chapter then explains how the book addresses the current conduct of the energy transition by inquiring into its key dimensions, namely making new energy resources, passing through markets, economic instruments, <b>technological</b> <b>demonstration,</b> and the spatialities and temporalities of energy transition processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of Martian outposts development is strongly {{based on the}} capability of achieving {{a high level of}} autonomy both in terms of operations management and of resources availability. In situ production of consumables is a key point to allow humans to work and live on Mars avoiding or limiting the need for re-supplies of materials from Earth. Required consumables can be produced in situ exploiting the locally available resources, but also by means of green-houses and waste recycle systems. Dedicated robotic missions for in situ demonstration of this type of technologies are a fundamental step of the Martian In Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) development roadmap. This paper is focused on the extraction of oxygen and fuels (e. g. methane) from the Martian atmosphere, and presents a feasibility study for a small <b>technological</b> <b>demonstration</b> plant...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the JTI-Clean Sky (CS) project, and during {{the first phase of the}} Low Noise Configuration Domain of the Green Regional Aircraft – Integrated <b>Technological</b> <b>Demonstration</b> (GRA-ITD, the preliminary design and <b>technological</b> <b>demonstration</b> of a novel wing flap architecture were addressed. Research activities were carried out to substantiate the feasibility of morphing concepts enabling flap camber variation in compliance with the demanding safety requirements applicable to the next generation green regional aircraft, 130 - seats with open rotor configuration. The driving motivation for the investigation on such a technology was found in the opportunity to replace a conventional double slotted flap with a single slotted camber-morphing flap assuring similar high lift performances -in terms of maximum attainable lift coefficient and stall angle- while lowering emitted noise and system complexity. Studies and tests were limited to a portion of the flap element obtained by slicing the actual flap geometry with two cutting planes distant 0. 8 meters along the wing span. Further activities were then addressed in order to increase the TRL of the validated architecture within the second phase of the CS-GRA. Relying upon the already assessed concept, an innovative and more advanced flap device was designed in order to enable two different morphing modes on the basis of the A/C flight condition / flap setting: Mode 1, Overall camber morphing to enhance high-lift performances during take-off and landing (flap deployed); Mode 2, Tab-like morphing mode. Upwards and downwards deflection of the flap tip during cruise (flap stowed) for load control at high speed. A true-scale segment of the outer wing flap (4 meters span with a mean chord of 0. 9 meters) was selected as investigation domain for the new architecture in order to duly face the challenges posed by real wing installation. Advanced and innovative solutions for the adaptive structure, actuation and control systems were duly analyzed and experimentally validated thus proving the overall device compliance with industrial standards and applicable airworthiness requirements...|$|E
