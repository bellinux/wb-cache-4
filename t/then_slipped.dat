5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked {{his hands behind his}} neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E

25|$|With {{their return}} to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1995–96 season the club would begin a period that would see them earn their best ever results.

25|$|The club {{made the}} semi-finals in 1991 and 1992 under coach Warren Ryan. Wests were NSWRL Club Champions in 1991 when all three grades made the semi-finals. The team {{also made it}} to the {{pre-season}} Challenge Cup final in 1993 but was beaten by a star-studded Canberra side.

25|$|Looking for an {{improved}} start to his 2009–10 season, Seguin spent his summer {{working on his}} game. His dedication paid off, {{as he opened the}} season with 36 points in 18 games until sidelined by a hip pointer. His early season success led NHL Central Scouting to name him the top prospect for the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. He <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> to second, behind Taylor Hall, who was eventually selected first overall by the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E

25|$|After Houdini's death, {{his friend}} Martin Beck {{was quoted in}} Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key {{required}} to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and {{could not have been}} smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.|$|E
25|$|The return {{game against}} was played {{a week later}} on 17 March 2016 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. Defender Adil Rami opened the scoring as he stooped to head a José Antonio Reyes corner in off the post. The match <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> out of Basel's reach inside two minutes {{at the end of}} the first half. Reyes danced through the Basel defence and his low cross gave Kévin Gameiro an easy finish from close range. A minute later, Michael Krohn-Dehli {{advanced}} with a quick run and was the provider of the cross that found Gameiro. The striker's header came back off the underside of the crossbar and bounced in off his leg to make it 3–0 at half-time. Basel showed only small signs of a fightback. Luca Zuffi's effort from 25 yards out was still rising as it flew over the crossbar. Breel Embolo missed two chances late in the game as the Swiss side were dumped out of the competition. The result extended Sevilla's run of Europa League home wins to 11 – the longest in the competition's history and put a dent in Basel's impressive away record in Europe this season.|$|E

25|$|When news began leaking {{that the}} three men were to be {{executed}} and a country-wide curfew would be imposed at 11:00 PM, Paglin was at a movie. After being called out and told the news, he hurried to Begin's safe house, where he was meeting with members of his high command, where doubts were being raised over the feasibility of hanging the sergeants with the British and Haganah on high alert. Paglin, {{who had not been}} allowed to venture into British-controlled areas by the high command for the previous six months, asked to take personal charge of the operation. He was convinced that the sergeants could be hanged inside the plant, and the bodies could be moved to an orange grove and hung there, since attempting to move the two alive would be too great a risk. Since the hangings were meant as a 'lesson for all to see', Irgun wanted the bodies hung up in public. That was so clear that the mayor of Tel Aviv, Yisrael Rokah, feared Irgun would hang them in the city's main square, while in Netanya it was feared that they would be hanged on local lamp posts. Begin approved Paglin's plan. Paglin <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> {{out of the house and}} drove to Netanya in his car, where he collected four Irgun men; Benjamin Kaplan, Yoel Kimchi, Avraham Rubin, and Yosef Meller. They arrived at the diamond plant in the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Parma <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> back to eighteenth {{position}} {{after an}} Edinson Cavani brace saw Napoli comfortably overcome a Parma side without a win since {{the opening day}} of the season, which led to president Tommaso Ghirardi demanding improvement. Parma then beat Sampdoria at home in thick fog and A.S. Bari away by a solitary goal to nil to shoot up to fourteenth position and ease pressure on Marino, the latter including a wonderful goal from Antonio Candreva. Parma secured a respectable draw at home to early season pace-setters Lazio the next week as ex-Lazio star Hernán Crespo opened the scoring for Parma, netting his 65th league goal for the club, before Luca Antonelli's own goal cancelled it out on the stroke of half-time. Next up were reigning champions Internazionale who beat Parma by five goals to two, overcoming an early Hernán Crespo brace, who was again scoring against former employers. The Argentinian striker was again on the scoresheet the following week as former manager Francesco Guidolin returned to Il Tardini {{for the first time since}} his summer departure, opening the scoring from the penalty spot with 24 minutes played before Udinese's Antonio Di Natale equalised 11 minutes later. Crespo then put his team back in front for good early in the second half as Parma won 2-1 and scoring his 150th Serie goal. The following week, Parma travelled to Palermo and took the lead inside ten minutes as Alessandro Lucarelli found the net. Parma then surrendered their lead and three second half goals from the Rosanero were enough to see Parma off and the match finished 3–1. The Ducali rounded off their pre-Christmas schedule with home match against rivals Bologna, who proved to be stubborn opposition in a goalless draw.|$|E
25|$|The {{month of}} the December started early for Bengaluru FC as the club took on Shillong Lajong on 1 December 2013 at the Bangalore Football Stadium. Bengaluru FC {{eventually}} came out as the victors in the match after two early goals from captain Sunil Chhetri in the 7th and 34th minute (from a penalty) sealed a 2–1 win for the team. The victory pushed Bengaluru FC {{to the top of}} the I-League table to begin the month. Their second match of the month came away from home at the Duler Stadium. Bengaluru FC took on the reigning champions from last season, Churchill Brothers. Bengaluru FC took an early second half lead of 2–0 thanks to strikes from Sean Rooney and Sunil Chhetri. Churchill Brothers brought a goal back with a strike from Balwant Singh before Chhetri sealed the match for Bengaluru FC by scoring his second goal of the match as Bengaluru FC won 3–1. The team then continued their away form in Kolkata on 11 December 2013 when they defeated Mohammedan at the Salt Lake Stadium by a score of 3–2. After taking an early 21st-minute lead through Johnny Menyongar it was Josimar who scored the equalizer for Mohammedan in first-half stoppage time. Sunil Chhetri then restored the lead for Bengaluru FC in the 48th minute before Josimar once again equalized for Mohammedan in the 57th minute but in the 71st minute it was Sunil Chhetri who scored his second goal of the match and the eventual winner for the Bangalore side. However, the club <b>then</b> <b>slipped</b> to their third loss of the season in their next match against East Bengal - thus their second loss to East Bengal this season - at the Bangalore Football Stadium on 15 December 2013. Both goals for East Bengal were scored by James Moga and Chidi Edeh. It was in this match that Bengaluru FC managed to draw 8,216 fans into the Bangalore Football Stadium, the most the team has had till that point. Despite the loss though, Bengaluru FC still managed to end the month of December and the year 2013 with a victory on 21 December 2013 against Salgaocar at the Bangalore Football Stadium in which penalty goals from Sunil Chhetri and Robin Singh (his first of the season) sealed a 2–1 win for the team.|$|E
