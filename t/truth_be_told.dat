5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: <b>Truth</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Told.</b> Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E
25|$|The Cubists are {{not waiting}} for the war to end to recommence {{hostilities}} against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all {{four corners of the}} canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.|$|E

500|$|In his {{recollections}} {{from that}} period, writer Victor Eftimiu {{suggested that the}} relationship was not entirely harmonious: [...] "Camil Ressu, like other young unknown painters, {{found a lot of}} support and encouragement with Bogdan-Pitești. <b>Truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> the maecenate was rather thrifty, it profited from the needs of the debuting and impoverished artist. But without it things would've been much worse, since others did not even offer as much". He also argued that, contrary to speculation about his wealth, Bogdan-Pitești [...] "maybe paid up so little because that is all he had to spare". Reputedly, the Ileana boss was losing a fortune on maintaining the Vlaici manor, surrounded as it was by barren land.|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of 'Idolator' {{was more}} {{positive}} {{of the song}} saying she [...] "actually forgot Lopez is still considered a singer, what with her two-year hiatus to focus on all her fragrances and clothing lines and babies and such. It's nice to have her back—yes, not every J-Lo song was a hit, but we all danced to 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight' back in the day. 'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. [...] <b>Truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting your day {{with a bowl of}} Kellogg's Cornflakes, but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} positive. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded Rocket Science as a C, calling the film [...] "one of those terminally annoying, depressive-yet-coy Sundance faves {{in which the}} tale of a mopey teen misfit unfolds behind a hard candy shell of irony". David Cornelius of DVD Talk criticized the film's phoniness and {{deliberate}} quirkiness. He was impressed by Thompson's portrayal of Hal, [...] "bursting with authenticity", but wrote that the supporting characters [...] "never have the chance to ring true" [...] in a cast [...] "overflowing with unnecessary hokey colorfulness". Online film critic for ReelViews James Berardinelli called the film [...] "moderately uplifting but not especially memorable" [...] and claimed that [...] "the problem with Rocket Science is that the character {{at the center of the}} drama isn't very energetic or, <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> interesting." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips, who gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, felt that it [...] "doesn't quite work" [...] and [...] "the spark goes out of the writing" [...] when Hal seeks out Ben in Trenton.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars {{and called}} the film [...] "a superbly drawn {{animated}} feature" [...] and, in his print review wrote, [...] "The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet, is a learning experience {{as well as an}} entertainment." [...] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as Beauty and the Beast and was [...] "a good film, not a great one". Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it [...] "an impressive, almost daunting achievement" [...] and felt that the film was [...] "spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations", but was less enthusiastic {{toward the end of his}} review saying, [...] "Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> even for adults it is downright strange." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Just a Fool" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In a track-by-track review, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song [...] "looks obligatory on paper but fortunately isn't so bad in reality [...] <b>Truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> we suspect there's a good reason why this has been saved for the back-end of the album". Chris Younie of 4Music praised the song, writing that [...] "It's mature, sophisticated and unlike anything else we've heard on the album. If you want variety, you got it". Andrew Hammp for Billboard was also positive toward the track, commenting that the song has an [...] "epic" [...] chorus that only increases in volume as the song progresses. In an extremely positive review, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday wrote that Aguilera and Shelton [...] "empty their broken hearts in a magnificently sung breakup song". She also praised [...] "Just a Fool" [...] as Aguilera's career signature which should [...] "stand next to 'Beautiful'". Mike Wass of Idolator called [...] "Just a Fool" [...] is a [...] "gorgeous" [...] country ballad, while Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{described it as a}} [...] "surprisingly warm duet" [...] and Molly Lambert of Grantland named it [...] "a monster-ballad".|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised Raskulinecz's production, Lee's vocals and the [...] "fair {{share of}} {{crossover}} hooks", {{adding that the}} band sounded [...] "less tortured tonally even if it remains quite dramatic." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson said, [...] "When [...] uses baroque orchestral accoutrements to wage an air assault on her demons... she's {{more than just the}} token girl in the pit." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the album four stars out of five, saying that the band's trademark sound was present on the album [...] "and <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> we wouldn't want it any other way." [...] Mark Lepage of the Montreal Gazette praised the album, calling it [...] "one rolling, chugging, plangent epic." [...] According to Chad Grischow of IGN, Evanescence is a [...] "great album that delivers the familiar while {{keeping an eye on the}} future." [...] Rob Williams of the Winnipeg Free Press described the album as gothic nu metal and hard rock, with dramatic orchestration which makes everything sound [...] "big and alive": [...] "With so many extra bells and whistles, despair has never sounded so epic." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe wrote that the album captures [...] "each party elevating the other far above where their proclivities would get them on their own." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 20, 1996, A {{head coach}} R. C. Slocum {{promoted}} Sherman to offensive coordinator to replace dismissed Steve Ensminger. Months later, Sherman resigned {{to start his}} professional coaching career as the assistant offensive line and tight ends coach for the Green Bay Packers. When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers. I've enjoyed the small-town atmosphere of College Station for my family, and Green Bay offers that same atmosphere. If the <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> <b>told,</b> {{there is not a}} whole lot of difference between an `Aggie' and a `Cheesehead." [...] He served the position for the 199798 seasons. After Packers head coach Mike Holmgren resigned to accept the Seattle Seahawks head coach position, Holmgren hired Sherman to become the offensive coordinator for the 1999 season.|$|E
