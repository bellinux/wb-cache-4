5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who emigrated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>USA</b> in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, {{and for a}} time in the 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic career is anchored to her studio in Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho, where she took photographs of the local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. Perhaps her most famous work remains her documentary photographs of the Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and in the same year ended her career as a photographer. Many of her Native American images are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution and National Archives.|$|E
