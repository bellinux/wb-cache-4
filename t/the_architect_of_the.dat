The London Exchange of Wood's day was also destroyed by fire in 1838. Bristol's Exchange is therefore unique, the only surviving 18th-century exchange building in England.|$|E
5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as <b>the</b> <b>architect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of}} the 1974 season.|$|E

His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative {{opposition to abortion}} to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform.

5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been <b>the</b> <b>architect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience.

5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in a special election in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. Brown faced no challengers from his own party.

Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Traffic on the opened {{section was}} {{much lower than}} anticipated, and the {{prospects}} of building {{the rest of the}} canal dwindled, as profits were minimal. However, in 1829 James Green {{turned his attention to the}} link to Taunton. He had been <b>the</b> <b>architect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bude Canal, which was built for tub-boats and used inclined planes to change levels, and proposed a similar solution here. The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal had opened in 1827, making navigation from Taunton to Bridgwater easier than on the River Tone. In a report of 1830, Green proposed using vertical lifts instead of inclined planes, and estimated the cost of the canal at £65,000.|$|E

By September 1892, a second-floor hall was converted into an assembly hall and by 1897, a chemistry laboratory was moved from Main Building to a retrofitted auxiliary gym in the Alumnae Gymnasium. The Board of Trustees allocated $25,000 {{to expand the}} gymnasium on June 12, 1905, after considering options of expansion as early as 1901.
