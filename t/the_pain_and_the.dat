5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient the cause of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress {{is a key element}} in effective pain management.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked if}} they drew {{inspiration}} from the previous film adaptations of Treasure Island for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to [...] "clear his mind of stereotypes", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor Wallace Beery, whom he [...] "loved {{because of the way}} he talked out of the side of his mouth." [...] For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited James Dean as an important reference because [...] "there was a whole attitude, a posture" [...] wherein [...] "you felt <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> youthful innocence", and he also cited the film Braveheart because [...] "there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{her first}} {{performance}} in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramović explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she {{would pick up}} a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body – <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramović began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. [...] "Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The strongest drug in {{the early}} Tour de France was strychnine. Other than that, riders would take {{anything}} to survive the tedium, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> exhaustion of stages that could last more than 300km. That included alcohol, which was already strong in French culture and sometimes purer than water after World War I destroyed water pipes and polluted water tables, and ether. There are photographs of riders holding ether-soaked handkerchiefs to their mouths, or leaving them knotted under the chin so the fumes would deaden the pain in their legs. The smell, enough to turn a man's stomach said Pierre Chany, discouraged some but also showed the extent of suffering by others. Roger Lapébie, winner of the Tour in 1937, said he smelled ether [...] "in the bunch near the finish; {{it used to be}} taken in a little bottle called a topette." [...] Its use lasted decades; riders were caught using it as late as 1963.|$|E
2500|$|As {{far north}} as Fairbanks, Alaska, a {{reviewer}} wrote that, if the film had been shown {{to the people of}} Europe before the war started {{there would have been no}} war:"'Civilization' is worth $1.50 today, tomorrow, or at any time. It is a masterpiece—a picture that grips and thrills. It preaches a powerful sermon and preaches it in a way that makes it interesting. ... After seeing 'Civilization' one can truthfully say that had Henry Ford produced a film like this one that Ince directed, and sent it broadcast throughout the civilized world as an argument against war, he would have accomplished more for universal peace than did his famous 'peace expedition.' He would have reached the great mass of people who have but a faint recollection of the horrors of war, and would have showed them <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> suffering and the sorrow that war brings with it. Had such a picture as 'Civilization' been shown to the people of Europe before the war started there would have been no war." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the 1997 BRIT Awards held in Earls Court, London on 24 February, the Bee Gees {{received}} {{the award for}} Outstanding Contribution to Music. On 14 November 1997, the Bee Gees performed a live concert in Las Vegas called One Night Only. The show included a performance of [...] "Our Love (Don't Throw It All Away)" [...] synchronised with a vocal by their deceased brother Andy and a cameo appearance by Celine Dion singing [...] "Immortality". The CD of the performance sold over 5 million copies. The [...] "One Night Only" [...] name {{grew out of the}} band's declaration that, due to Barry's health issues, the Las Vegas show was to be the final live performance of their career. After the immensely positive audience response to the Vegas concert, Barry decided to continue despite <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> concert expanded into their last full-blown world tour of [...] "One Night Only" [...] concerts. The tour included playing to 56,000 people at London's Wembley Stadium on 5 September 1998 and concluded in the newly built Olympic Stadium in Sydney, Australia on 27 March 1999 to 72,000 people.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Stewart made a short video against {{domestic}} violence for Amnesty International, {{in which he}} recollected his father's physical attacks on his mother and the effect it had on him as a child. For instance, he said, [...] "the physical harm... a shocking pain. But there are other aspects of violence which have more lasting impact psychologically on family members. It is destructive and tainting. As a child witnessing these events, one cannot simply help somehow feeling responsible for them; for <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> screaming, and the misery." [...] In the same year, he gave his name to a scholarship at the University of Huddersfield, where he is Chancellor, to fund post-graduate study into {{domestic violence}}. Stewart's childhood experience also led {{him to become a}} patron of Refuge, a UK charity for abused women. In 2009, Stewart gave a speech at the launch of Created Equal, a book about women's rights, talking again about his personal experiences with domestic violence and the impacts they had on him. He remarked, [...] "violence is a choice and it's a choice a man makes...the lasting impact on my mother...and indeed on myself...was extreme. Overcoming the lessons of that male stereotype that I was being shown was a struggle." [...] He now hopes to set an example of [...] "what it has been like to be in an environment of such violence and that it can pass and that one can survive it and even though sometimes still a struggle." [...] Additionally, in October 2011, he presented a BBC Lifeline Appeal on behalf of Refuge, discussing his own experience of domestic violence and interviewing a woman whose daughter was murdered by her ex-husband.|$|E
2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E
