In 2005, Labour's support was much lower {{than in the previous}} two elections, which David Rubinstein has attributed to anger at the war in Iraq and towards Blair himself.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia Lennon (née Powell; 10 September 1939 – 1 April 2015) was {{the first}} wife of English {{musician}} John Lennon and mother of Julian Lennon. She grew up in <b>the</b> <b>middle-class</b> section of Hoylake, on the Wirral Peninsula in North West England. At the age of 12, she was accepted into the Junior Art School, and was later enrolled in the Liverpool College of Art. John Lennon also attended the college; a meeting with Powell in a calligraphy class led to their relationship.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, 14.6per cent of Altrincham's {{population}} was middle class, {{slightly higher than}} the figure for England and Wales, which was 14per cent. By 1971 this gap had increased to 28.8per cent compared to 24per cent nationally, while the town's working class population had declined, from 30.3per cent in 1931 (36per cent in England and Wales) to 18.6per cent (26per cent nationwide). The remainder comprised clerical and skilled manual workers. This change in social structure {{was similar to that}} seen across the nation– although biased towards the middle classes– making Altrincham <b>the</b> <b>middle-class</b> town it is today.|$|E
5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and <b>the</b> <b>middle-class,</b> while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable. Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E

They became friends with Douglas Colvin, who had recently moved to the area from Germany, and Jeffrey Hyman, who was the initial lead singer of the glam rock band Sniper, founded in 1972.|$|E

Why is it that every tradesman, every school-master, every bank-manager, and every clergyman produces one, two, three or more old maids?

Ince also embroidered her biography so that she would appeal to <b>the</b> <b>middle-class</b> audiences as the heroine of a melodrama, claiming that she was the daughter of an illustrious Japanese artist. The biographical-type publicity added emotional and psychological authenticity to the character that Aoki played in the film.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and <b>the</b> <b>middle-class</b> with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E
5|$|For aristocrats {{to succeed}} in private and public life during the Heian period, it was {{essential}} to be fluent in the composition and appreciation of waka, as well as having thorough knowledge of and ability in music, and calligraphy. Poetry was used in witty conversations, in notes of invitation, thanks or condolence, and for correspondence between friends and lovers. Some of the finest poetry of the Heian period came from <b>the</b> <b>middle-class</b> court society such as ladies in waiting or middle-rank officials. Uta-awase poetry contests, in which poets composed poetry on a given theme to be judged by an individual, were held from 885 onwards, and became a regular activity for Heian courtiers from the 10th century onward. Contest judgments led to works about waka theory and critical studies. Poems from the contents were added to imperial anthologies. Critical theories, and the poems in the anthologies (particularly the Kokinshū), {{became the basis for}} judgments in the contests. Utaawase continued to be held through the late-11th century, as social rather than literary events. Held in opulence in a spirit of friendly rivalry, they included chanters, scribes, consultants, musicians, and an audience. During the Heian period, waka were often collected in large anthologies, such as the Man'yōshū or Kokinshū, or smaller private collections of the works of a single poet. Waka also featured highly in all kinds of literary prose works including monogatari, diaries and historical works. The Tale of Genji alone contains 800 waka.|$|E

5|$|The CIA and the Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. On {{the night}} of April 16 to 17, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's Bay of Pigs, and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain José Ramón Fernández to launch the counter-offensive, before taking {{personal}} control of it. After bombing the invaders' ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade to surrender on April 20. He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated {{by a panel of}} journalists on live television, personally taking over the questioning on April 25. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange for medicine and food valued at U.S. $25 million. Castro's victory was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among <b>the</b> <b>middle-class</b> Cubans who had been detained {{in the run-up to the}} invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many fled to the U.S., establishing themselves in Florida.|$|E
