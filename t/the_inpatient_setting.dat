The physician can order a stepped series of interventions as the weight rises. The correlation must be individualized with attention paid to the patient's normal weight and fluctuations, diet, comorbid disorders (such as a seizure disorder) and urinary system functioning. Progressive steps might include redirection, room restriction, and increasing levels of physical restraint with monitoring. Such plans should also include progressive increases in monitoring, as well as a level at which a serum sodium level is drawn.|$|E

40|$|Background: Seclusion is the {{physical}} isolation {{of a patient}} {{for the purpose of}} protecting the patient from harming self or others. It is often nurses who place a patient in seclusion, especially in the psychiatric setting. Seclusion is a very common practice in a psychiatric setting. To date, there is limited evidence describing nurses' attitudes towards seclusion in the psychiatric setting. Purpose: This paper describes nurses' attitudes towards the use of seclusion in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> psychiatric <b>setting.</b> Method and Sampling: A qualitative design was used to assess nurses' attitudes towards the use of seclusion. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling. Two focus group discussions were used to obtain descriptions of nurses' attitudes to the use of seclusion for patients in psychiatric settings. Twelve nurses with current and/or previous work experience in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> psychiatric <b>setting,</b> ages 21 - 62, participated in the study. Results: Factors guiding nurses' attitudes included feelings and beliefs, the patient's behavior, and the participant's knowledge of seclusion. Behaviors such as violence, agitation, and/or elopement were perceived as threats to the patient's safety and the safety of others. Seclusion was used to eliminate such behaviors and was perceived as therapeutic for both the patient and the individual unit. While participants reported an overall positive attitude towards seclusion, they reported a lack of knowledge in regards to policies governing seclusion. Conclusion: Attitudes were found to influence the use of seclusion. Participants in this project felt seclusion was useful to reduce violent behaviors and agitation. Seclusion was also seen as therapeutic. Educating nurses is necessary to change their attitudes towards seclusion and to reduce the practice of seclusion in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> psychiatric <b>setting...</b>|$|R

Results: For the primary analysis population (intention-to-treat), the proportion of subjects who remained continuously abstinent were significantly greater in the varenicline plus counselling arm (31. 1 %, n= 61) compared with counselling alone (21. 4 %, n= 42; RR 1. 45, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 2. 03, p= 0. 03).

40|$|Objectives This {{research}} explored {{what happens}} when psychological input is offered in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> <b>setting</b> and examined service users' and staff members' understanding and portrayal of these experiences. Design Narrative analysis, an interview design, {{was used to examine}} experiences of inpatient psychological interventions in National Health Service inpatient mental health settings. Methods Ten participants (four service users and six staff members; five males and five females; seven White British, one White Irish, one Black African, and one Black Caribbean) were recruited via clinical psychologists from an inpatient psychology department and participated in 18 - to 90 -min interviews. Results Evidence suggested that direct, indirect, and strategic psychological interventions were used in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> <b>setting,</b> with formulation and the therapeutic relationship conceptualized as common features. Connections between inpatient psychology and change, evidenced in the stories, suggested that interventions can help people make sense of a crisis, improve relationships, and contribute to meaningful recovery. Evidence of barriers suggests that psychological input in this setting might not always be compatible with everyone's needs. Conclusions This paper explored service users' and staff members' experiences of psychological input in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> <b>setting.</b> The analysis revealed that psychological provision in the inpatient mental health setting is varied and encompasses direct and indirect input, valued by service users and clinicians. It also identified that psychological input in the acute inpatient mental health setting is perceived as meaningful and can lead to changes at an interpersonal and intrapersonal level. There is a sense that providing psychological thinking in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> <b>setting</b> can be challenging due to environmental constraints and individual factors. This highlights the need for further research focused on the costs and clinical effectiveness of providing psychological thinking within the acute inpatient mental health setting.

40|$|Abstract Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD) involves a complex constellation of symptoms including suicidal threats, suicidal gestures, and self-harming behaviors. There are limited effective treatment options for adolescent patients with BDP or BDP traits in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> hospital <b>setting.</b> This paper discusses BPD and BPD traits in adolescents, examines {{challenges faced by}} inpatient nurses, summarizes evidence supporting Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) for adolescents with BPD traits, and proposes specific <b>inpatient</b> <b>setting</b> programming {{to address the needs}} of this population. This paper suggests that DBT may be successfully implemented to optimize outcomes. DBT has typically been used in adult outpatient settings. However, research suggests that the integration of DBT strategies in inpatient settings serving adolescents could facilitate effective outcomes. Nurses in particular are critical members of the hospital treatment paradigm. Outcomes could be enhanced if nurses have a better understanding of DBT and if they received training to enable them to contribute to DBP programming...|$|R

40|$|Inpatient pain {{management}} {{is a necessary}} skill set for all physicians, but it is particularly important for hospitalists working in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> <b>setting.</b> Pain is so pervasive in the hospital setting that it is {{sometimes referred to as}} “the fifth vital sign, ” and a failure to manage pain has important implications not only for hospitalists, but also for the hospitals where they practice.

While opioid monotherapy has long been the primary approach to {{pain management}} in <b>the</b> <b>inpatient</b> <b>setting,</b> the medical literature has documented numerous significant negative effects of opiate and analgesic use in hospital-based practice. These negative effects include opioid addiction, gastroin-testinal issues such as nausea and vomiting, constipation and ileus, and serious complications such as respiratory depression and sedation, which increase the risk of respiratory failure, aspiration, decreased mobility, and falls. 1 Research also indicates that current pain management strategies often fail to adequately control pa-tient pain.
