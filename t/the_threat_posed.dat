5|$|During late 1999 No.75 Squadron {{was placed}} on alert to provide close air support and air defence to protect the {{international}} forces which had deployed to East Timor as part of INTERFET. However, despite <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by Indonesian forces, ultimately they were not required.|$|E
5|$|Lanfranc {{remained}} {{concerned about}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by Odo, and authorised William {{to improve the}} defences at Eynsford. The work was probably carried out between 1085 and 1087, and enclosed the former burh with a stone curtain wall to form a castle.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission {{a study to}} look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, to combat <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by the Soviet Navy and other fleets of the Warsaw Pact. It {{ceased to exist}} in 1969 when it was subsumed into the newly formed Strike Command, which had also absorbed the former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later also absorbed Air Support Command, the former Transport Command.|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, {{even trying to}} take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E

5|$|Each side {{considered}} {{how best}} to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by its opponent, and after Virginia returned each side tried to goad the other into attacking under unfavorable circumstances. Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in water not of their own choosing; Jeffers in particular was under positive orders not to risk his ship. Consequently, each vessel spent the next month in what amounted to posturing. Not only did the two ships not fight each other, neither ship ever fought again after March 9.|$|E
5|$|English colonial {{traders and}} explorers from Carolina, since its {{founding}} in 1670, had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended {{all the way to the}} Mississippi. Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by the French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{had been}} de facto leader since 1994, but had {{focused more on}} military, foreign affairs and the country's {{security}} than day-to-day governance. By 2000, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by cross-border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E

5|$|Reagan's {{concession}} speech {{emphasized the}} dangers of nuclear war and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election {{from the state of}} Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions {{were filled with}} earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 in response to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by the Spanish armada, and were probably kept ready for action {{throughout the rest of}} Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 to counter <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but {{it was noted that}} serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the marine}} area, <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>posed</b> are from {{industrial}} fishing (salmon farming and cultured mussels) and aquaculture {{particularly in the}} Gulf of Corcovado, intensive exploitation of marine resources, with large maritime traffic of trawls, associated fishing.|$|R
5|$|Following this, the 9th Division was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} towards Sio, further around the coast {{on the northern}} side of the Huon Peninsula. The Japanese {{in the area around}} Finschhafen were growing in strength, however, as a large number of the 4,000 to 5,000 men that had garrisoned Finschhafen had managed to escape inland, {{while the rest of the}} 20th Division, under the command of Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri, was being moved from Bogadjim, south of Madang, to provide reinforcements. Wootten considered that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by this force meant that Sattelberg would have to be captured before the 9th Division could undertake its advance towards Sio.|$|E
5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or north toward the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of defeating Nazi Germany first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "atomic age" [...] was {{initially}} {{used in a}} positive, futuristic sense, but by <b>the</b> 1960s <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>posed</b> by nuclear weapons had begun to edge out nuclear power as the dominant motif of the atom.|$|R

5|$|In July 1942, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations by General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander, South West Pacific Area (SWPA), against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or north toward the main Japanese naval base at Truk.

5|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 {{to examine whether}} the central keep could {{be turned into a}} Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding coast line were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W. Turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during the middle of this work, later depicting the castle in landscape paintings and sketches of the area.|$|E
5|$|Pinto Colvig as Grumpy and Sleepy in a dual role: Grumpy {{initially}} disapproves of Snow White's {{presence in}} the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> by the Queen and rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs and is frequently seen with one eye shut. Sleepy is always tired and appears laconic in most situations. Sterling Holloway, who would later voice many other characters for future Disney films was originally considered to voice Sleepy by Walt Disney.|$|E
