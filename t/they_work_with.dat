25|$|Since the client's life is his to live, {{and not the}} therapist's, {{hermeneutic}} counseling {{states that}} therapists must {{be open to the}} horizons of the individuals <b>they</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> even when their horizon conflicts with the therapist's.

Instead, an understanding of client resistance is re-conceptualized as part of the dialogical process and effort for both client and therapist to learn how to relate to one another authentically and arrive at contextual truth and meaning for the client.|$|E

25|$|Watt's Expansion Engine is {{generally}} considered as of historic interest only. There are however some recent developments which {{may lead to a}} renaissance of the technology. Today, there is an enormous amount of waste steam and waste heat with temperatures between 100 and 150°C generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the Organic Rankine Cycle. In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below 100°C. Such systems are however fairly complex. <b>They</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> pressures of 6 to 20 bars, so that the whole system has to be completely sealed.|$|E
