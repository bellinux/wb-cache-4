5|$|Whilst {{the exact}} date Saint Padarn founded {{the church is}} uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church {{may have been the}} seat of an abbot or bishop during the years {{immediately}} following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop (as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as we understand the term today, but closer to a collegiate church), nor did it necessarily possess any substantial buildings. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.|$|E

25|$|During 1888 his {{personality}} was the dominating feature of French politics, and, when he resigned his seat as {{a protest against}} the reception given by the Chamber to his proposals, constituencies vied {{with one another in}} selecting him as their representative. His name was the theme of the popular song C'est Boulanger qu'il nous faut ("Boulanger is <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>We</b> Need"), he and his black horse became the idol of the Parisian population, and he was urged to run for the presidency. The general agreed, but his personal ambitions soon alienated his republican supporters, who recognised in him a potential military dictator. Numerous monarchists continued to give him financial aid, even though Boulanger saw himself as a leader rather than a restorer of kings.|$|E

In 1893 {{he was a}} representative in the National Assembly, a philosophy professor in the National Institute {{and was one of}} the main public speakers for the general José María Reina Barrios government. Among his most famous speeches were the one that he gave in the name of the National Assembly during the seventy second anniversary of the Independence of Central America on 15 September 1893, the one about general Miguel García Granados when the remains of the former president were moved to the newly built Guatemala City General Cemetery on 30 June 1894, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> pronounced in Nicaragua celebrating the expulsion of William Walker on 15 September 1895.|$|E
25|$|American {{political}} scientist Peter Roman’s {{work on the}} subject led him to believe that Cuba’s “grassroots democracy” goes beyond the power to vote freely for one of several candidates representing both pro or anti-socialist positions. He argues that at the “people level” democracy exists in Cuba today and that this democracy has been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are {{the ideas of the}} centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as critics charge, imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels. British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper “Participation is key to Cuba’s democracy” that “Two models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> know is based on indirect representation by professional politicians controlled by party factions. The other model, associated with Rousseau’s concept of the ‘general will’ and made famous by the Paris Commune of 1870”. Ludlum likens Cuba’s local participation to the latter model.|$|E

[...] Chairman of the Chinese Standing Committee of National People's Congress Wu Bangguo noted that Belarus has been rapidly developing under Lukashenko. Lithuanian MPs have also praised the Belarusian economy and its contribution to the Lithuanian economy; Stanislovas Gedraitis said that he was in awe of the Belarusian progress created mostly by the efforts of the national leader.|$|E
500|$|All sources which {{date the}} battle {{agree that it}} took place in 1000.

Oddr Snorrason says further that the battle is [...] "memorialized for the fallen men on the Third or Fourth Ides of September", (10 or 11 September). Mesta states that the battle occurred on 9 September, and other sources agree with either date.

She spends her adolescence and adulthood in France following her adoptive father's stroke and eventually becomes aware of her history through a posthumous letter from her uncle Nabi, who had arranged for her to be sold as a child.

500|$|Nine {{days before}} the final, the two clubs faced {{each other in a}} league match at Highbury. With Arsenal unable to retain the title, having lost to Leeds United, manager Arsène Wenger rested several players, as did Southampton manager Gordon Strachan, whose team started without six of their first-choice eleven. Winger Jermaine Pennant on his league debut scored a hat-trick, as did Pirès, in a 6–1 win. Strachan {{believed}} the result had little bearing on their chances of winning the cup, noting: [...] "There is little pressure on Southampton to lift the trophy. We were not expected to reach the final and have already clinched a place in the UEFA Cup." [...] Wenger accepted his team were [...] "favourites" [...] but expected [...] "...Southampton to be at their best against us because it will be a different team than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> faced in the championship recently." ...|$|E

While carrying Lawless with an electromagnet, The Collector says [...] "Care for a Rolo, sweet Xena?" [...] The reference was included because the writing staff were given free Rolos at the time. In The Collector's lair, several celebrities are seen stored in aluminized PET film bags. Some of these include The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and Tom Baker, who portrayed the fourth incarnation of the doctor in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. [...] "There are several Doctor Who actors but Tom Baker is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> always go with" [...] Hauge explained in the episode's DVD commentary. Other captives include actress Yasmine Bleeth, Gilligan from the series Gilligan's Island and Spock and Seven of Nine from Star Trek. The segment also features the series' first reference to , when The Collector uses a mint-condition of Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber. Because the episode was written before the film's release, the writers did not know [...] "how bad it was gonna be", in their view, and therefore did not include any [...] "obligatory shot" [...] at the film. As he dies, The Collector poses as Lorne Greene's character Commander Adama in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica.|$|E

500|$|The {{characters}} from the proposal did {{appear in the}} final version, albeit in much-altered form. An early draft featuring the musician-turned-journalist Hollis and half-Cuban spy Tito as the two protagonists did not satisfy Gibson, and so he introduced the character of Milgrim, the drug-addled translator. The story of Tito's family of Chinese exiles in Cuba turning to crime was not based on historical events, though their role as [...] "illegal facilitators" [...] was inspired by real crime families specializing in smuggling, a phenomenon Gibson encountered {{in the course of}} his work with the futurist consulting entity Global Business Network. Although he had intended his 2003 novel Pattern Recognition to be a standalone work, elements of it manifested in the script of its eventual successor, including the character of amoral marketing guru Hubertus Bigend. As Gibson developed the plot, [...] "it became apparent that Node, the shadowy magazine startup, was way Bigendian", and thus Spook Country came to inhabit the same fictional universe as its predecessor. In a January 2007 interview, the author revealed that the later novel was set in the spring of 2006, and described the shared world of the novels as [...] "more or less <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> live in now".|$|E
500|$|On November 5, California Chrome {{entered the}} Breeders' Cup Classic {{as a strong}} {{favorite}} over Travers Stakes winner Arrogate. [...] Chrome led from the outset, tracked by Arrogate. [...] The two horses engaged in the homestretch and in the final yards, Arrogate surged ahead to defeat California Chrome by a neck at the finish. The two horses dominated {{the remainder of the}} field by over 10 lengths. [...] Critics of the race and Espinoza himself speculated that the loss was because Espinoza had failed to make his move and establish a large enough lead earlier in the race. [...] Sherman also wondered if Espinoza could have opened up a bigger lead, but he was unsure if it would have mattered: [...] "That winner is the real McCoy, I knew he was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> had to beat, but I didn't know how good he was," [...] he said. While the horse came out of the race in good shape, the press asked Raul Rodriquez if the horse [...] "knew" [...] that he had lost the race, and the groom replied, [...] "oh yeah." [...] Post race analysis gave California Chrome a Beyer Speed Figure of 119, the highest of his career, topped by 120 for Arrogate.|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>we</b> did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
