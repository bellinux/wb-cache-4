500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute I got off that train, I knew what she was trying to say. She was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "you're reciting something, stop. If you're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what you're doing here, make it shorter and easier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> {{or rather}} {{trying not to}} tell me, that Beatrice was mad enough to think of {{committing}} suicide?" [...] Elizabeth inquired.|$|E
60|$|Conversation, had Isobel been fit for it, was {{scarcely}} possible. But in a disjointed {{sort of way}} she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> things.|$|R
5000|$|They {{were quite}} splendidly {{appointed}} {{as a sort}} of private temple; but when Cardell showed me a bronze tripod which was obviously 19th century and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that it had been dug up from the ruins of Pompeii, I became rather unhappy. When he showed me a bronze statue of Thor and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that it was of a Celtic horned god. I couldn't help myself pointing out that Thor was not a Celtic god - and then he became rather unhappy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] {{said the}} lawyer, [...] "I see {{you have some}} good reason, Poole; I see there is {{something}} seriously amiss. <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that this}} is a final overthrow?" [...] said Yeovil in a shaking voice; [...] "are we to remain a subject race like the Poles?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} has happened, and you are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the tale backwards. Come {{up to the house}} and get in the shade and begin at the beginning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would {{you mind}} {{being a little}} clearer?' I said sharply. 'I really don't {{understand}} what it is you are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> What do you mean about loyalty and character? I don't understand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shore {{there was}} so darn many fellers who wanted <b>to</b> an' <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what'd come off, I thought I'd never find out. But I got the story piece by piece. An' here's what happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] he said, {{with some}} wild notion of comforting her; [...] "but <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this trouble! There is nothing under heaven--no calamity, no sorrow--that I wouldn't gladly share with you, or take all upon myself if I could!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll gain nothing {{by making}} fools of yourselves, my men," [...] he said. [...] "The {{law is a}} good deal too strong for you. Now, <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> sensibly what is {{worrying}} you, and if it comes within my business I'll see what I can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind. I {{wish you}} would stop <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the story. I'm telling you. What {{happened}} was this: somehow--I can't make out how--mother found out. And then, of course, it was all over. She stopped the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{who died}} here just after I came, told me," [...] replied An-Tak. [...] "He {{said there was}} a way out, that he had {{discovered}} it but was too weak to use his knowledge. He was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how to find it when he died. Oh, Luata, if he had lived but a moment more!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something, Father Sobriente," [...] he said, with an effort. [...] "Speak out, I implore you. I {{can stand}} {{anything}} but this mystery. I {{am no longer}} a child. I {{have a right to}} know all. This that you are telling me is no fable--I see it in your face, Father Sobriente; it is the story of--of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, what're {{you giving}} me? That Sheriff Burley <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> and dad {{a lot of}} rot about this Wade. Why, he's only a little, bow-legged, big-nosed meddler--a man with a woman's voice--a sneaking cook and camp-doctor and cow-milker, and God only knows what else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{we met in}} the vestibule, my sweet,' {{continued}} Herbert, in {{a soothing}} voice; 'we came out of opposite chambers, and you knew me; my Venetia knew <b>me.</b> <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> my darling,' he added, {{in a tone of}} coaxing fondness, 'try to remember how Venetia knew her father.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{to enter}} into {{negotiations}} for the surrender of the mine. It is a good notion. You would mature your plan. Of course, I don't ask what it is. I don't want to know. I would refuse to listen to you if you <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> I am not fit for confidences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{few minutes}} ago," [...] he began, in the grave, candid tones {{of his other}} profession, [...] "you were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} regarding some money. I do not seek your confidence, but it is my duty to advise you that anxiety and worry will work against your recovery. If you have any communication to make about this--to relieve your mind about this--twenty thousand dollars, I think was the amount you mentioned--you would better do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{goodness}} for that, anyhow! Please understand, Mr. Pratt, {{that so far}} as I {{am concerned}} {{you are not a}} welcome visitor here at any time, but if ever you should see my mother, and you should give her the least idea of what you are always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> you will make life a perfect purgatory for me. I dislike you now more than any one I know. I should simply hate you then. You understand?" ...|$|E
60|$|That little cry of {{distress}} quite genuine in its inexpressiveness, altered my feeling towards Mrs Fyne. It {{would have been}} so easy to have done nothing and to have thought no more about it. My liking for her began while she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of the night she spent by the girl's bedside, the night before her departure with her unprepossessing relative. That Mrs Fyne found means to comfort the child I doubt very much. She had not the genius for the task of undoing that which the hate of an infuriated woman had planned so well.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your loss is great, {{and your}} misfortune a heavy one,' said Mr Haredale, looking restlessly towards the door: 'and {{this is not}} a time to comfort you. If it were, I am in no {{condition}} to do so. Before I leave you, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> one thing, and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> plainly, I implore you. Have you seen, or heard of Emma?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold {{was gone}} only ten days, {{and came back}} late on a Friday evening. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{about what he had}} done and seen, but broke off and said, [...] "Well, I am very stupid; I went to all the places they told me to see at Rouen and {{everywhere}} else, but I can't recollect anything about them." ...|$|R
40|$|Have finally ordered Freeman's {{book from}} Robertson for you, {{although}} they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that they had}} not told me they had never had it. Good news of RP's elevation to the bench and that Dobbie has been offered the Solicitor-Generalship. The venture with Dave fell through and he has now gone to Camperdown but not heard what he is doing. C 4 /C 366...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe it!" [...] {{declared}} Peter angrily. [...] "I don't {{believe a}} word of it. You are simply trying to fool me, Jenny Wren. There never was a Rabbit and there never will be a Rabbit who would go swimming {{for the fun of}} it. I belong to the Cottontail branch of the Hare family, and it is a fine family if I do say so. My cousin Jumper is a true Hare, and the only difference between us is that he is bigger, has longer legs and ears, changes the color of his coat in winter, and seldom, if ever, goes into holes in the ground. The idea of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I don't know about my own relatives." ...|$|E
6000|$|We had our signs, too, {{and they}} was {{hundreds}} in number. Sometimes {{she would sit}} {{looking at me and}} considering hard how to communicate with me about something fresh,--how to ask me what she wanted explained,--and then she was (or I thought she was; what does it signify?) so like my child with those years added to her, that I half-believed it was herself, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where she had been to up in the skies, and what she had seen since that unhappy night when she flied away. She had a pretty face, and now that {{there was no one to}} drag at her bright dark hair, and it was all in order, there was a something touching in her looks that made the cart most peaceful and most quiet, though not at all melancholy. [N.B. In the Cheap Jack patter, we generally sound it lemonjolly, and it gets a laugh.] ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{one of his}} {{teachers}} said he thought Carsen had {{the makings of a}} director. [...] "At first I thought he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I was a terrible actor, but in fact he was saying, 'I think youâ€™re actually a directorâ€‰â€”â€‰how your mind works, and the way you contribute to what everyone else is doing.' That got me thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> gently, Faith, but I {{see that}} you {{consider}} me one of the innocent unfortunates, who {{have no right to}} marry till they be healed, perhaps never. I have dimly felt this during the past year, now I know it, and thank God that I have no child to reproach me hereafter, for bequeathing it the mental ills I have not yet outlived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God!" [...] he cried, and then, [...] "Jane!" [...] Suddenly {{he turned}} toward Werper. [...] "My wife?" [...] he asked. [...] "What has become of her? The farm is in ruins. You know. You have had {{something}} to do with all this. You followed me to Opar, you stole the jewels which I thought but pretty pebbles. You are a crook! Do not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that you are not." ...|$|R
5000|$|Positive Christianity is National Socialism ... and National Socialism is {{the doing}} of God's will.... Dr. Zoellner ... has <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that Christianity {{consists}} in faith in Christ as the Son of God. That {{makes me laugh}} ... Christianity is not dependent upon the Apostle's Creed .... butis represented by the Party .... the German people are now called ... by the FÃ¼hrer to a real Christianity .... The FÃ¼hrer is the herald of a new revelation.|$|R
5000|$|... "Somebody's <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> Something" [...] {{is a song}} by Midnight Oil {{drawn from}} their 1982 studio effort 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The song more or less {{disappeared}} after the tour for the album ensued. It was performed on May 18, 2017 at the Vic Theatre in Chicago, IL USA on The Great Circle tour, when the band played 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in full.|$|E
5000|$|Claudia Mitchell-Kernan, {{recognized}} as the first scholar to interject African American women's signifyin' practices into broader linguistic discourses, recorded the following example. Grace is pregnant and beginning to show, but has not informed her sister yet. Her sister, seemingly unaware of the situation, comments on her weight gain:"Grace (noncommittally): Yes, I guess I am putting on a little weight. Rochelle: Now look here, girl, we both standing here soaking wet and you still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> it ainâ€™t raining? ...|$|E
5000|$|Len ... uses {{a lot of}} chords ... he's {{really good}} ... he uses his fingers all over ... he has been always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to use more chords and sing a couple of songs in minor keys... Bob Dylan He showed an early {{interest}} in music and began playing piano at age 8. Studying classical music in his early teens, he learned to play the oboe so he could join the high school band, and during his senior year joined the Akron Symphony Orchestra. He eventually earned his B.A. in Music Education from the University of Akron, moved to New York City, and received an M.A. from Columbia University.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are obvious}} enough," [...] she replied. [...] "The {{young man is}} all that you say, even more ingenuous than I had {{believed}} possible, but I fancy I must be getting old. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that he was in}} love with another woman, and I felt suddenly powerless. I think I must be getting to that age when one prefers to achieve one's conquests with the lifting of a finger." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Huckabee stated, [...] "I'm {{not real}} fond when people <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I'm just against same sex marriage. I tell people I'm {{actually}} just for keeping {{marriage in the}} only manner in which it's even been known in any culture in any civilization throughout all of history, and dear friends, until Moses comes down with two stone tablets from Brokeback Mountain saying he's changed the rules, let's keep it like it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May we {{show it to}} him, mother?" [...] said Jock. [...] "I {{should think}} he was quite to be trusted with it. I see! I was reading an account of this method of his to Dr. Lucas one day, and he was much {{interested}} and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something about my father; but it was after his speech grew so imperfect, {{and he was so}} much excited and distressed that I had to lead him away from the subject." ...|$|R
