5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E

500|$|Almost all {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that Chamorro could not win. She was depicted as rich {{with no real}} experience. There were rumors that she received millions from the United States via their embassy {{and that she was}} a US lackey; that she was too religious; and that her coalition was too disorganized, had no money, and was plagued by in-fighting. In reality, her humility and provincial roots worked for her; she had run a family, a business and been part of the original Junta; the Sandinistas blocked payment of funds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US while simultaneously claiming she received them; and she had long been vocal about her displeasure of US involvement in Nicaragua. According to Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Humberto Belli, an editor of La Prensa and later Minister of Education; and other writers such as Edward Sheehan and Shirley Christian who have written about the country, Nicaragua {{is one of the most}} religious countries in Latin America. Chamorro's faith and support for free expression united those who had felt alienated by the Sandinistas. Her chief appeal though was that she promised peace to a country tired of war.

Mawuse Ziegbe of MTV News praised her cover, writing, [...] "Singing with no band onstage, donning a glittery black dress with her signature red hair flowing to her shoulders, the legendary vocalist's performance scored a standing ovation." [...] Jillian Mapes and Megan Vick of Billboard praised the performance, writing, [...] "As if Beyonce's 2008 ballad 'If I Were a Boy' wasn't moving enough, country queen Reba McEntire's smokey twang and solemn stance turned the song on its head." [...] They {{also noted that the}} simple and powerful performance [...] "is enough to inspire tears, or at least goosebumps." [...] Country Music Television's Chet Flippo felt that McEntire's performance was [...] "the musical highlight of the evening" [...] and added that it was [...] "a lesson of what country music should be striving for these days". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave a mixed review of her performance, writing that [...] " [...] did something unexpected, softening her delivery and finding the creases in the song, as if Beyoncé were whispering <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wings."

500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{terms of}} the {{marriage}} were settled by two agreements, a public treaty and a private contractual arrangement. The treaty was executed between Spain and the United Kingdom in London on 7 May 1906 by their respective plenipotentiaries, the Spanish Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Don Luis Polo de Bernabé, and the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, Bt. Ratifications were exchanged on 23 May following. Among other conditions, the treaty stipulated:BE it known unto all men by these Presents that whereas His Catholic Majesty Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, has judged it proper to announce his intention of contracting a marriage with Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, niece of His Majesty Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and daughter of Her Royal Highness the Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (Princess Henry of Battenberg)…Article I. It is concluded and agreed that the marriage between His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII and Her said Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena shall be solemnized in person at Madrid {{as soon as the}} same may conveniently be done. II. His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII engages to secure to Her said Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena from the date of her marriage with His Majesty, and for the whole period of the marriage, an annual grant of 450,000 pesetas. His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII also engages, if, by the will of Divine Providence, the said Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena should become his widow, to secure <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> date of his death, an annual grant of 250,000 pesetas, unless and until she contracts a second marriage, both these grants having already been voted by the Cortes. The private settlements to be made on either side in regard to the said marriage will be agreed upon and expressed in a separate Contract, which shall, however, be deemed to form {{an integral part of the}} present Treaty…III. The High Contracting Parties take note of the fact that Her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, according to the due tenor of the law of England, forfeits for ever all hereditary rights of succession to the Crown and Government of Great Britain… The treaty's reference to the forfeiture of Victoria Eugénie's British succession rights reflected neither the British government's censure of the alliance, nor any [...] made by her. Rather, it was an explicit recognition of the fact that by marrying (and becoming) a Roman Catholic, Victoria Eugénie lost any right to inherit the British crown as a consequence of Britain's Act of Settlement. This exclusion was personal and limited: those among her descendants who do not become Roman Catholic remain in the line of succession to the British Throne.|$|E
