40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{control in}} millimeter-wide fractures {{has been a}} challenge in well drilling all the time. Low pressure-bearing capacity of a plugging zone will result in excessive consumption of lost circulation materials (LCMs) and extra down time. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted on <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> of millimeter-wide fractures to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> effects {{of different types of}} LCM including rigid granules, elastic particles and fiber. Maximum plugging pressure, total loss volume before sealing and plugging time were taken as the evaluation index of <b>the</b> LCM <b>plugging</b> effect. According to the experimental results, <b>the</b> synergistic <b>plugging</b> mechanisms of different LCM combinations were also analyzed. Experimental results showed that the total loss volume of <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> zone formed by rigid and elastic particle combination was generally greater than 400  mL, and <b>the</b> maximum <b>plugging</b> pressure of <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> zone formed by elastic particle and fiber combination was generally less than 6  MPa. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> zone formed by the combination of the three types of LCMs has <b>the</b> maximum <b>plugging</b> pressure of up to 13  MPa and total loss volume before sealing of 75  mL. In <b>the</b> synergistic <b>plugging</b> process, rigid granules form a frame with high pressure-bearing capacity in the narrower parts of the fractures; elastic particles generate elastic force through elastic deformation to increase the friction between a fracture and a plugging zone to make <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> zone more stable; fibers filling in the pore space between the particles increase the tightness and integrity of <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> zone. <b>The</b> experimental results can provide guidance for the optimal design of LCMs used in the field...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through <b>the</b> <b>plug.</b> Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. <b>The</b> <b>plug</b> now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E

Enzymes for digestion of <b>the</b> <b>plugs</b> included hyaluronidase of the bovine testes and streptomyces hyalurolyticus, chondroitinase ABC and AC, and sialidase (neuraminidase). Our study indicated that: I) Sialic acid is distributed throughout <b>the</b> <b>plugs</b> and may be a major component, followed by a lesser amount of chondroitin sulfate B. 2) Chondroitin sulfate A, C, D and E and chondroitin may be minor components. 3) Hyaluronic acid is negligible in <b>the</b> <b>plugs.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the bearing {{capacity}} of soil plugs (internal shaft resistance) through fundamental research on the bearing mechanism of dry silica sand plugs. Push-up load tests on the dry silica sand plugs inside a model pipe pile and DEM simulations were carried out to investigate <b>the</b> <b>plugging</b> behaviour. <b>The</b> influences of the packing state of <b>the</b> soil <b>plugs</b> (<b>the</b> relative density), and the height of <b>the</b> <b>plugs</b> on <b>the</b> bearing capacity were investigated. Prior to the pushup load tests, element tests on the silica sand and DEM analyses were performed to characterise the silica sand and to determine suitable DEM analysis parameters. The experimental and DEM results clearly show that the push-up force increases significantly {{with the increase in}} the aspect ratio of <b>the</b> soil <b>plug,</b> H/D, and with the relative density of <b>the</b> soil <b>plug.</b> <b>The</b> DEM analyses show a good agreement with the experimental results when the push-up force is small. Furthermore, the DEM results reveal that only the density of <b>the</b> soil <b>plug</b> in <b>the</b> lower portion, adjacent to the pile tip, increases gradually with the increase in the push-up displacement as well as the increase in H/D. Hence, it is the lower portion of <b>the</b> soil <b>plug</b> that mainly controls the capacity of <b>the</b> soil <b>plug...</b>|$|R

The astronauts' rescue was prevented by <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin.

5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown {{rats and}} house mice, {{ovulation}} occurs {{on a regular}} cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> and may do so either immediately or after several hours.|$|E
5|$|Standard USB has {{a minimum}} rated {{lifetime}} of 1,500 cycles of insertion and removal, the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 cycles, and the newer Micro-USB and USB-C receptacles are both {{designed for a}} minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal. To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to <b>the</b> <b>plug,</b> so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear.|$|E

While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room.

5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E

The idea behind this was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions.

5|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxygen {{atmosphere was}} consistent with that {{that had been used}} successfully in the Mercury and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen, and also to seal <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> door hatch cover. During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, {{two and a half hours}} longer than it had been during the plugs-out test.|$|E
