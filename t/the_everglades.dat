5|$|People {{have lived}} in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without {{a full understanding of}} the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Seminole Wars {{increased}} the U.S. {{military presence in}} <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> {{which resulted in the}} exploration and mapping of many regions that had not previously been recorded. The military officers who had done the mapping and charting of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> were approached by Thomas Buckingham Smith in 1848 to consult on the feasibility of draining the region for agricultural use.|$|E

50|$|Taylor Slough, {{located in}} the southeastern corner of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Everglades,</b> along with <b>the</b> much larger Shark River Slough farther to the west, are the {{principal}} natural drainages for <b>the</b> freshwater <b>Everglades</b> and <b>the</b> essential conduit for providing overland freshwater to Florida Bay.|$|R
5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E
5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E

5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|Humans likely first {{inhabited}} the South Florida region 10,000 to 20,000years ago. Two tribes of Native Americans developed on the peninsula's southern tip: the Tequesta {{lived on the}} eastern side and the Calusa, greater in numbers, on the western side. <b>The</b> <b>Everglades</b> served as a natural boundary between them. The Tequesta lived in a single large community near the mouth of the Miami River, while the Calusa lived in 30villages. Both groups traveled through <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> but rarely lived within them, remaining mostly along the coast.|$|E

The melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> than {{in their native}} Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans. They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2million has been spent on keeping them out of Everglades National Park.|$|E

5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} force in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. Starting at the last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> eroding some of it away, and created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E
