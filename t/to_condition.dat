25|$|The {{policy of}} the Government of Israel is <b>to</b> <b>condition</b> the access of Palestinians {{who live in the}} Palestinian territories to {{healthcare}} in Israel upon financial coverage from the Palestinian Authority. In January 2009, following the war, the Palestinian Authority cancelled financial coverage for all medical care for Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, including coverage for chronically ill Palestinian patients, and those in need of complex care that is not available in other tertiary medical centers in the region. This decision was protested by human rights organizations.|$|E
25|$|Subject SB-2046 had {{part of his}} right, prefrontal lobe removed {{because of}} cancer. While his IQ and a {{majority}} of other normal functions were unharmed, he had severely impaired decision-making skills especially when he had to consider immediate vs. future reward and punishment. His decisions were almost always guided by immediate reward or punishment and disregarded any long-term consequences. Researchers were incapable of conditioning patient SB-2046 to nonverbal stimuli containing emotional meaning (reward or punishment), but were able <b>to</b> <b>condition</b> the patient to verbal stimuli containing emotional meaning.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism {{sees the}} {{experience}} of dying as a very sensitive moment in one's spiritual life because the quality of one's mind {{at the time of}} death is believed <b>to</b> <b>condition</b> one's future rebirth. The Buddhist ideal is to die in a calm but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the Bardo Thodol is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.|$|E

25|$|Around the 19th century, the {{northern}} limites of the Bairro, including the zone around São Pedro de Alcântara up to Príncipe Real were delimited. The area was consolidated {{with the construction}} of a group of diverse buildings and specifically rental properties. The block that existed between Rua da Rosa and the Travessa do Tijolo came <b>to</b> <b>condition</b> activity in the neighborhood, including the establishment of various newspapers, of which O Bolastill remains. In 1880, the municipal council decided to widen the Rua dos Moinhos do Vento (now the Rua de São Pedro de Alcântara), expropriating lands and buildings that restricted its expansion.|$|E
25|$|All {{organizations}} can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments. For instance, former Mayor Martin O’Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat, a performance-measurement data and management {{system that allows}} city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends <b>to</b> <b>condition</b> of potholes. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency {{in terms of time}} and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million. Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.|$|E
25|$|Broadly speaking, cask ale brewing {{starts the}} same as that of keg beer. The same brew run could be used to make cask, keg, and bottled beer. The {{difference}} is what happens after the primary fermentation is finished and the beer has been left <b>to</b> <b>condition.</b> Typically keg and bottled beers are either sterile-filtered or pasteurised or both, but beer destined for cask is simply 'racked' (poured) into the cask in its natural state. Finings are usually placed in the cask to assist 'dropping' the yeast giving a clear beer. Extra hops and priming sugar may also be added. The cask is sealed and sent off to the pub. In this state it is like a bottle-conditioned beer and, like bottle-conditioned beers, the beer will continue to develop for a certain period of time. Also like bottle-conditioned beers, the length of time the beer can last in the cask will depend on the nature of the beer itself: unopened, stronger beers can last for months; light, delicate beers need to be tapped and sold quickly. Stronger beers may also need longer to settle and mature. Some pubs have been known to keep very strong beers in a sealed cask for a year or more to allow them to fully develop.|$|E

500|$|... {{appears in}} Final Fantasy XIII-2 {{as the main}} antagonist. Hailing from the distant past prior to the War of Transgression, Caius is a former Pulse l'Cie who became the Guardian of the seeress Paddra Nsu-Yeul. At some point, to protect the seeress and her city from an invading army, Caius {{transforms}} himself into a Bahamut Eidolon, thus killing himself to save her. Etro, touched by his sacrifice, gives him her own heart, the Heart of Chaos, so he could become Yeul's eternal guardian and eventually as the living repository for his visions. However, this gift soon turns into a curse, as seeing Yuel die repeatedly makes him hateful towards Etro, attempting <b>to</b> <b>condition</b> Noel to be his killer before deciding to enter Valhalla and kill the goddess personally. As Serah and Noel encounter the past versions of him during their journey, Caius uses {{his knowledge of the}} timeline to create the various paradoxes they deal with while he battles Lightning in Valhalla. After barely managing to defeat her, Caius enters a final battle with Noel and Serah. Eventually, after being defeated in his Eidolon form and with Noel still refusing to kill him, Caius manages to force Noel's blade through himself, destroying Etro's heart. Though he seems to die, he is later seen in the game's secret ending, seated on Etro's throne and saying that he and Yeul can begin their lives in the [...] "new world".|$|E
