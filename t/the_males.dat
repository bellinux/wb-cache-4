5|$|Unlike other whales (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> Sexual {{dimorphism}} is usually reversed, with <b>the</b> <b>males</b> being larger, but the females of all baleen whales are usually five percent larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed through whale song, notably in humpback whales where <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of the species sing elaborate songs. Male right whales have bigger callosities than female right whales. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> are generally more scarred than females which {{is thought to be}} because of aggression during mating season.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown <b>the</b> <b>males</b> linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting <b>the</b> <b>males</b> there. During amplexus, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
40|$|Background and methodology: Men's and women's {{attitudes towards}} <b>the</b> <b>male</b> {{contraceptive}} pill and their {{trust in the}} effective use of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill were investigated, {{as well as the}} associated variables of reported health behaviours, perceived self-efficacy and type of sexual relationship, using a questionnaire survey. Results: Although both sexes had a favourable attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill, females had a more positive attitude than men. Conversely, women had less trust that men would use <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill effectively. Males in stable sexual relationships were more positive about <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill than those in casual sexual relationships. Gender, relationship type and trust in the effective use of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill reliably predicted attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill. High perceived self-efficacy was related to engaging in more health behaviours, and in men a positive association between health behaviours and attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill has been found. Discussion and conclusions: A positive attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill does not automatically imply that the individual is confident about its effective use. Once <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill is widely available, promotional campaigns could target not only men but also their female partners, as the latter tend to come into contact with health services more frequently. In order to increase confidence in effective implementation, a variety of presentations of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pill should be made available in line with individual needs and lifestyles...|$|R
5|$|Finally <b>the</b> <b>male</b> mounts and copulates {{with the}} female. Afterward, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> {{generally}} dismounts {{and the two}} pair usually run away from each other. However, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> sometimes chases <b>the</b> female and tries to copulate again.|$|R
5000|$|The female seahorse (hippocampus) {{deposits}} {{eggs into}} the pouch on <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> abdomen. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> releases sperm into the pouch, fertilizing the eggs. The embryos develop within <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> pouch, nourished by their individual yolk sacs.|$|R
5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} sexual selection in his book The Descent of Man. Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> Eventually all <b>the</b> <b>males</b> will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to <b>the</b> <b>males</b> in other ways. For example, some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make <b>the</b> <b>males</b> more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{observed}} that <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of some species, such as birds of paradise, {{were very different}} from the females.|$|E
5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} in that <b>the</b> <b>males</b> appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> backed into the tadpole-filled {{water of the}} tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>male</b> keeled box turtle is very {{aggressive}} during {{the act of}} mating. In some instances <b>the</b> <b>male</b> turtle will chase and injure a female. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> will often persist until the female allows its advances.|$|R

5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since <b>the</b> <b>males</b> were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed <b>the</b> <b>males</b> to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{colouration}} of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{allows them}} to visibly {{stand out from the}} brown forest floor. This bright colouration provides a sexual advantage for the adult males, increasing their likelihood of successfully mating. The result is rapid evolutionary selection within the species for brighter plumage and more conspicuous behaviour patterns in <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> The bright colouration also makes <b>the</b> <b>males</b> more susceptible to predation. Males are more expendable for this reason; {{only a small number of}} males are needed within any generation in order to perpetuate the species. While sexual selection leads to bright plumage, natural selection in turn favors defensive colouration in the birds. There is higher fitness in birds monitoring nests whose colouration acts as camouflage-protection from predation.|$|E

5|$|Wildebeest do {{not form}} {{permanent}} pair bonds {{and during the}} mating season, or rut, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. These small territories are about 3000 m2, with up to 300 territories per km2. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into season. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed {{at the end of}} the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness. This usually occurs between May and July, and birthing usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. Wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously.|$|E

5|$|A Scottish {{study showed}} that {{mortality}} in common house martins occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57%.

5|$|A {{study on}} albinistic prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that {{albinism}} in this species conferred an advantage for <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{compared to the}} wild-type; albino males had higher mount frequencies than wild-type males.

5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes).

Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>male</b> wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> will enter <b>the</b> female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase <b>the</b> <b>male</b> from <b>the</b> web. The Courtship process consists of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in <b>the</b> web. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|R
5|$|Australian robins are a {{group of}} small insectivorous birds, whose exact {{position}} in the bird family tree is unclear. Named after a superficial resemblance to the European robin, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of many species sport bright red or pink on their plumage. Four species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic.|$|E
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, <b>the</b> <b>males</b> risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E

50|$|Portia {{exhibits}} a different mating behavior and strategy than other jumping spiders. In most jumping spiders, males mount females to mate. <b>The</b> Portia <b>male</b> shows off {{his legs and}} extends them stiffly and shakes them to attract the female. The female then drums on the web. After <b>the</b> <b>male</b> mounts her, <b>the</b> female drops a dragline and they mate in mid-air. Mating with Portia spiders can occur off or on the web.The spider also practices cannibalism before and after copulation. The female usually twists and lunges at <b>the</b> mounted <b>male.</b> (P. fimbriata, however, is an exception; it does not usually exhibit such behavior.) If <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is killed before completing copulation, <b>the</b> <b>male</b> sperm is removed and <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is then eaten. If <b>the</b> <b>male</b> finishes mating before being killed, the sperm is kept for fertilization and <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is eaten. A majority of males are killed during sexual encounters.|$|R
50|$|Most Zorapterans copulate during mating, but <b>the</b> <b>male</b> Z. impolitus has a {{distinct}} and primitive form of mating behaviour in which <b>the</b> <b>male</b> Z. impolitus produces a spermatophore, a packaged single sperm, which it attaches to the abdomen of a female ground louse. The female ground louse initiates the intercourse by advancing towards <b>the</b> <b>male</b> and brushing <b>the</b> antenna {{on the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>male</b> ground louse is aroused, it moves behind the female and carries out a mating display which comprises lowering the head, vibrating the antennae and moving back and forth repeatedly. The mating concludes with <b>the</b> <b>male</b> moving under <b>the</b> female and attaching the spermatophore to the abdomen of the female. The female then shifts the spermatophore into the reproductive tract.|$|R
