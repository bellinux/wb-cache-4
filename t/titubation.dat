60|$|The {{time came}} to go. The tipsy antics of the lads had led a {{majority}} of the soberer-minded lassies to compel a departure. I found myself, at the door, beside my little maiden. She had not had my experience, so she was sober. She was fascinated by the <b>titubations</b> of the lads who strove to walk beside their girls, and began to mimic them. I thought this a great game, and I, too, began to stagger tipsily. But she had no wine to stir up, while my movements quickly set the fumes rising to my head. Even at the start, I was more realistic than she. In several minutes I was astonishing myself. I saw one lad, after reeling half a dozen steps, pause {{at the side of the}} road, gravely peer into the ditch, and gravely, and after apparent deep thought, fall into it. To me this was excruciatingly funny. I staggered to the edge of the ditch, fully intending to stop on the edge. I came to myself, in the ditch, in process of being hauled out by several anxious-faced girls.|$|R

We provide a detailed clinical characterization of head <b>titubation</b> in 13 {{young children with}} Joubert syndrome. Method: Detailed characterization of head <b>titubation</b> was assessed by targeted clinical evaluation and/or analysis of videos. Results: In 12 of 13 children (eight males, five females; median age 6 y, range 2 mo– 15 y) head <b>titubation</b> was first recognized in the first 2 months of age and decreased in severity until spontaneous resolution. In all children, the head <b>titubation</b> was horizontal, high frequency (3 Hz), had small amplitude (5 – 10 °), was never present during sleep, and did {{not interfere with the}} neurodevelopment during infancy. In the majority of children, emotion, anxiety, and tiredness were worsening factors for head <b>titubation.</b> Interpretation: Head <b>titubation</b> is a benign, early presentation of Joubert syndrome. Head <b>titubation</b> in hypotonic infants should prompt a careful search for Joubert syndrome. Awareness of its occurrence in Joubert syndrome may avoid unnecessary investigations...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Discuss {{complex interplay}} of {{pathophysiological}} effects of cerebellar space occupying lesions on the vestibular pathway. Discuss challenges of diagnosis and referral along with differential and final diagnosis of unusual presentation. Case Report. We describe {{the case of}} a patient with vertiginous symptoms complicated by neurological features, namely, head <b>titubation</b> and tremor. The patient also had signs of oscillopsia and possible impairment of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The resulting symptom and sign complex made for a difficult diagnosis, as the interplay of the pathophysiology of these signs, were unusual. Conclusion. The discussion has revealed that the cerebellar lesions themselves may have simultaneously caused head tremor and an inability for the vestibulo-ocular reflex to compensate, resulting in vertigo. However, whether the vertigo was a result of an oscillopsia, nystagmus, or central cause, the referral route should initially be via a general physician to rule out such a life threatening cause as a tumour.

In this report, {{to the best of}} our knowledge we describe for the first time a diagnosis of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration several months prior to the diagnosis of clear carcinoma of the uterus. Case presentation A 75 -year-old Caucasian woman manifested a rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome with nystagmus, past-pointing, dysdiadochokinesis, dysarthria, truncal ataxia and <b>titubation.</b> The paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration was associated with anti-Yo and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. 14 - 3 - 3 protein was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin prior to laparotomy, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy. Our patient has survived for three years following diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an association of clear cell carcinoma of the uterus and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration with both anti-Yo and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. The findings imply that both antibodies contributed to the fulminating paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration observed in our patient, and this was of such severity it resulted in the release of 14 - 3 - 3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, a marker of neuronal death. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of episodic {{involuntary}} {{movements in the}} Border Terrier dog breed for over a decade. Recently, it has been hypothesized that this condition may {{be a form of}} paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the phenomenology and clinical course of this condition and compare it to known human movement disorders. Methods Data were collected retrospectively from clinical cases treated by veterinary neurologists and additional information was collected prospectively with an ad-hoc online survey directed to owners of affected dogs. Results The episodes are characterized by generalized dystonia, tremors, <b>titubation,</b> and, in some cases, autonomic signs, such as salivation and vomiting. The median age at onset of the episodes was 3 years and the interval between clusters of episodes could last several months. Most of the episodes occurred from rest, and 67 % of the owners reported that the episodes were associated with a trigger, most often excitement. Some owners reported an improvement after changing their dog's diet. We hypothesize that the Border Terrier attacks represent a form of paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia. Conclusions The finding of a dystonia phenotype within an inbred population suggests a genetic predisposition, and elucidating the genetic cause could facilitate improved understanding of dystonia. This genetic predisposition and the effect of treatment with anticonvulsant drugs and dietary changes on the severity of the paroxysms warrant further investigation on this condition...|$|E
40|$|Frontal ataxia may be {{the result}} of a {{unilateral}} frontal lesion. In this report three cases are presented with ataxia due to right frontal lesions. One case concerns a boy presenting with an unsteady gait and <b>titubation</b> of the trunk, mimicking developmental disequilibrium and with complex partial seizures. It proved to be caused by a small right-sided cavernoma in the middle frontal gyrus. After surgical intervention the symptoms and the seizures disappeared. Two subsequent cases concern teenage patients presenting with headache after an ENT infection and on physical examination mild dysmetric function of the upper limbs and slight disequilibrium, due to right-sided frontal lobe abscesses. After neurosurgical and antibiotic therapy the symptoms were relieved. The frontal origin of ataxia should be considered in children presenting with a "cerebellar syndrome". Frontal gait disorders consist of a clinical pattern of different gait disorders. The syndrome has been mentioned in the literature under different names. Our patients show signs compatible with the term frontal disequilibrium, a clinical pattern of frontal gait disorder. This assumes walking problems characterized by loss of control of motor planning, leading to imbalance. Remarkably, frontal ataxia may mimic developmental delay as demonstrated in the first case and {{may be the}} leading mild symptom in extensive frontal lobe damage as demonstrated by the two other cases. We suppose that frontal ataxia is the result of a disturbance in the cerebellar-frontal circuitries and an impairment of executive and planning functions of the basal ganglia-frontal lobe circuitry...|$|E

Cvičení ovlivnilo především oblast pánve, trendy naznačující zlepšení držení těla a {{stability}} nedosáhly ve všech případech statistické významnosti. Vzhledem k tomu, že technika cvičení je cíleně náročná, nesprávně provedené pozice nevedly ke zlepšení, ale projevily se nulovým efektem. Vždy byly nalezeny pozitivní změny ve smyslu zlepšení stability stoje a signifikantního posunu hrudní kyfózy k vertikále, což svědčí o zlepšení držení těla. V postavení ramen se projevila určitá rozkolísanost ve smyslu změn asymetrie ramen. Také postavení pánve reagovalo na intervenční zásahy přesuny asymetrie spinálních úhlů po 1. a 2. etapě cvičení, po 3. etapě došlo ke statisticky významnému vyrovnání levostranné asymetrie. Nalezli jsme zmenšení rozsahu titubací axiálního skeletu, což je doprovodným projevem zvýšení stability stoje. Celkově se nejlepší výsledky projevily po intervenci v roce 2007, kdy se snížil rozsah titubací ve směru osy x i y, byla zjištěna statisticky významná pozitivní změna v úpravě symetrie spina iliaca posterior superior a nalezen věcně významný trend snížení úhlových hodnot lordóz i hrudní kyfózy. Zdůvodnění těchto změn je možné najít ve zvýšeném důrazu na správné provádění technik cvičení a tím i úprav svalových dysbalancí. Subjektivní pocity seniorek byly velmi příznivé, vysoce pozitivně hodnotily pocit zlepšení stability stoje. During {{the years}} 2005, 2006, and 2007, we studied {{changes in the}} posture and spinal shape in three groups of younger female seniors (mean age 61, 63, and 66 years) using the diagnostic device DTP 2 following the interventional procedure of a targeted exercise program (the Chinese therapeutic exercise known as "Hui chun gong"). The exercise influenced mainly the pelvic area; the trends suggesting improved posture and stability did not reach statistical significance in all cases. Since the exercise technique is technically difficult, improperly performed positions resulted in a zero effect rather than improvement. Positive changes were always found in terms of improved stance stability and significant shift of the thoracic kyphosis towards the vertical axis, which suggests improved posture. Shoulder position showed {{a certain degree of}} inconsistency in terms of changes in shoulder asymmetry. Pelvic position also responded to the intervention procedures by shifting the asymmetry of the spinal angles after the 1 st and 2 nd phases of exercise, while a statistically significant offset of the left sided asymmetry was achieved after the 3 rd phase. We found a reduced extent of <b>titubation</b> of the axial skeleton, which was evaluated to be an accompanying effect of the improved stance stability. In total, best results were manifested following the intervention in 2007, when the extent of <b>titubation</b> was decreased in the direction of both the x and y axes, a statistically significant positive change was found in the adjustment of symmetry of the posterior superior iliac spine, and a materially significant trend of a decrease in the axial values of lordoses and thoracic kyphosis was observed. The reasons for these changes can be found in an increased emphasis on the proper performance of exercise techniques and thus adjustment of muscle imbalances. Subjective feelings of the senior patients were very beneficial, as they evaluated very positively the feeling of improved stance stability...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the American College of Physicians New Mexico Chapter Scientific Meeting, 10 / 10, Albuquerque, NM. A 64 y/o hispanic male {{was brought}} to the {{hospital}} by his family with confusion & hallucinations. His vital signs were within normal limits except for positive orthostatics. Pertinent exam findings included scanned speech, head <b>titubation,</b> glabellar sign & positive grasp reflex, increased tone in upper extremities and trunchal rigidity. Cerebellar signs were also abnormal with ataxic gait. Initial work up included infectious, neoplastic, and metabolic causes, all of which were negative. Several days into the hospitalization, additional history was obtained from the family. The patient had a history of long standing progressive deterioration in gait and balance. He also had increasingly frequent falls. Also mentioned, were changes in mood, behavior, and a history of urinary incontinence. Complicating these findings was a history of drugs and alcohol use by the patient years before. The patient has a sister with a similar condition and features, but the sister does not have any history of drug or alcohol abuse and functions at a higher level despite her older age. Based on history and physical exam, the diagnosis of probable Multi-system Atrophy (MSA) with predominant cerebellar ataxia was made. An MRI of the brain showed cerebellar atrophy with pontine flattening. The patient was treated with atypical antipsychotics while receiving supportive care including physical and occupational therapy. Conclusion 	This case illustrates the presence of familial MSA with genetic predisposition. MSA is a rare condition that may not be easily recognized. There is only one known study from Germany suggesting that genetic predisposition in MSA does occur. In addition, our case stresses the importance of good history and physical exam to diagnose this condition.

40|$|Background: Neurological {{disorder}} among male premutation {{carriers of}} Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) frequently occurs. In other hand, lacking of information results misdiagnosis of this disorder. Therefore {{this study is}} addressed to provide the data about neurological involvement of late-adult premutation carriers of FXS. Objectives: This research is to know neurological involvement of late-adult premutation carriers of FXS. Subjects and Methods: This was a descriptive study following cytogenetic, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and neurological examinations on premutation carriers of FXS. Cytogenetic and PCR results were secondary data from Central for biomedical research (CEBIOR) laboratory of Faculty of Medicine Diponegoro University during September 2009 – March 2010. Simple neurological examination techniques were done to observe neurological involment among male premutation carriers. Results: There were four males carrying premutation allele {{over the age of}} 50. Cytogenetic analysis revealed two subjects expressed fragile site. The other two subjects expressed no fragile site. PCR analysis revealed expanded allele from all subjects. Subject III. 6 showed intention tremor and gait ataxia, which are two mayor clinical criterions of FXTAS. Subject III. 8 showed gait ataxia which is a mayor criterion of FXTAS. Subject III. 9 showed intention tremor and gait ataxia, which are two mayor criterions of FXTAS. And Subject III. 10 showed gait ataxia which is a mayor criterion of FXTAS. Conclusion: Some cerebellar manifestations such as intention tremor, limb ataxia, gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, and <b>titubation</b> have been identified in premutation carriers of FXS. Southern Blot is needed to reveal subjects’s molecular status more accurate. Simple techniques to observe mayor and minor clinical criteria in this study had been proved can be used in the future.

40|$|SUMMARY Two {{unrelated}} children presenting {{with mental}} and physical retardation and sulphur deficient brittle hair are reported. These {{are thought to be}} further cases of the autosomal recessive neurotrichocutaneous syndrome of Pollitt, of which eight cases have been previously reported. Trichorrhexis nodosa may be a useful marker for inherited metabolic disease and has been described in patients with argininosuccinic aciduria, Menkes' disease, biotin deficiency, ' and in a disorder first described by Pollitt et a 12 in which sulphur deficient brittle hair was associated with {{mental and physical}} retardation in two sibs. Price et a 13 coined the term trichothiodystrophy for this syndrome and outlined the main features: sulphur deficient brittle hair, ichthyosis, nail dystrophy, dental caries, cataracts, involvement of the central nervous system, and decreased fertility. It was suggested that the hair shaft abnormality is diagnostic and that the clinical features may be due to a defect in transport or utilisation of sulphur-containing amino acids, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. We describe two unrelated children with this disorder in the second report "from the United Kingdom, emphasising the neurological and hair shaft abnormalities. severe flexural eczema.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} afferent information coming from the feet {{to the quality of}} walking. Bipedal locomotion is a movement that follows people since the first year of life. In childhood, it is a sign of our progressive growth and maturation of the nervous system and in old age it is similar. Often it is the walk that determines the ability of seniors to take care of themselves. With age, it is physiological that the walk changes. Whether it is depending on the diseases, which in elderly age often merge into chronicity, or for example pathological patterns of movement which the body can not compensate so well anymore. Impaired mobility, which {{goes hand in hand with}} walking, brings the risk of falling. Fall is one of the most serious injuries for seniors and its consequences can seriously jeopardize self-sufficiency and mobility of seniors. The risk of falling appears just for older people who are no longer able to adapt quickly to changes. The foot is a significant part of the stabilization system of the body. It mediates the first contact with the pad and informs us about its properties. This information is then transmitted to the upper decks of the central nervous system, which then better adapts movement to the pad surface. The amount of afferent information depends on many factors. The most important is the shoe that absorbs a large amount of afferent information from the foot and feet can not fully perform their function of gathering the information. In the theoretical part of my thesis, I discussed changes in physiological, social and psychological, the person goes through the aging process. Then I dealt with falls and their causes, consequences and prevention. In the third chapter I worked sole topic, its construction and the most frequent pathology. And in the last part I focused on walking, its development stages, types, and how should ideally look like. The aim of my thesis is to evaluate how much influence will stimulating the soles of the feet have for walking. Stimulation soles lasted for three months in the form of soft technology and mobilization leg joints, hardening feet hot and cold water, skin stimulation (sifting through the legs in a container with legumes), practicing active (small) foot and eventually coaching momentum and coordination feet by painting or writing with feet (pencil between 1 st and 2 nd finger). Another aim of my thesis is to identify preventive measures against falling for individual seniors. For this it is necessary to focus on the weaknesses of the individual and to assess its risk of falling. Long-term therapy should be designed so that it is manageable for seniors with regard to his health and ability. In the practical part was used qualitative research. As data acquisition techniques were used anamnesis, kinesiology analysis, examination of walking, fine motor skills and foot examinations of perception. Research was attended by four seniors, three women and one man in age ranges 70 - 80 years. Therapy carried every week for three months, in the end each proband completed twelve therapies. Each therapy lasted about 30 - 45 minutes. The results show that it has improved balance especially when standing. Patients gain more stability, two at Romberg III lost <b>titubation</b> and their endurance during solo standing increased. The walk improved, especially in the coordination. In unison, all patients improved fine motor skills of their feet. At the initial examination, only one patient managed to pick up a pen with both feet. At the output, all patients managet it. This work can be used by physiotherapists and other health professionals in nursing homes and similar facilities. It can also be used to increase brand awareness of senior's family members or as injury prevention in the home environment...|$|E
