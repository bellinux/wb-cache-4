25|$|Corker {{served as}} mayor of Chattanooga from 2001–05. While in office he {{implemented}} a merit-based bonus system for teachers. The system, established in 2002, awards <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> bonuses for improving student performance at Chattanooga's lowest performing schools. Two years after its implementation, {{a study published in}} The Tennessean showed that the percentage of third graders reading at or above grade level had increased from 53% to 74%. However, a report by the think tank Education Sector suggested that specific teacher training had at least {{as much to do with}} the student improvement.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{survey in}} Pakistan, pupils {{in private schools}} of Pakistan {{expressed}} their opinions on religious tolerance in the country. The figures assembled in the study reflect {{that even in the}} educated classes of Pakistan, Ahmadis are considered to be the least deserving minority in terms of equal opportunities and civil rights. In the same study, the teachers in these elite schools showed an even lower amount of tolerance towards Ahmadis than their pupils. Ahmadis are harassed by certain schools, universities and teachers in Pakistan's Punjab province. The harassment includes social boycott, expulsions, threats and violence against Ahmadi students by extremist students, <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> of the majority sect.|$|E
