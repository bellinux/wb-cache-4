Following the ascendancy of the Ming Dynasty, cannon were restricted at first to operations pacifying <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border,</b> including a resounding victory over a band of war-elephants in the 1380s. Cannon {{made their way to}} the northern border by 1414, where their noise had great effect on the Oirats, in addition to reportedly killing several hundred Mongols.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{insisted that}} its {{purchase}} also included most of West Florida {{and all of}} Texas.

5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either {{was in danger of}} losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{problems}} they encountered because of the fencing, the Byzantines ultimately managed to ferry the Magyar forces led by Árpád's son Liüntika across the Danube, possibly near modern Galaţi, and assisted them in pillaging the nearby Bulgarian lands. Once notified of the surprise invasion, Simeon headed north to stop the Magyars, leaving some of his troops at <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> to prevent a possible attack by Phokas. Simeon's two encounters with the enemy in Northern Dobruja resulted in Magyar victories, forcing him to retreat to Drǎstǎr. After pillaging much of Bulgaria and reaching Preslav, the Magyars returned to their lands,* Delev, Bǎlgarskata dǎržava pri car Simeon. * Canev, Bǎlgarski hroniki, p. 199. but not before Simeon had concluded an armistice with Byzantium towards the summer of 895.

5|$|Ernuszt's {{accounts}} of his activity as royal treasurer have been preserved. The accounts cover {{the period between}} 1 February 1494 and 31 December 1495. The document is {{an important source of}} demographic, economic, and cultural research of late medieval Hungary. The accounts contain a detailed record of the one-florin tax assessed in Hungary proper, Transylvania and Slavonia in 1494 and 1495 which was to be paid by each peasant household. They do not contain data for the fourteen southern counties in Hungary proper, because the ispán (or head) of Temes County, who was responsible for the defence of <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border,</b> was entitled to spend the royal income from the one-florin tax assessed in this region. The peasants in southern Slavonia were also exempt from the one-florin tax because of the frequent Ottoman raids in this region.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, for mainly {{patriotic}} reasons, the Australian Natives' Association helped establish the Federation League, a society {{dedicated to the}} creation of a federal nation. Following a series of addresses by the future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border.</b> One of these towns, Corowa, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, Dr John Quick, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to pass an act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal constitution. This has been seen as the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on 1 January 1901.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Beaver Township, {{the creek}} enters Main Township. It {{continues}} following Catawissa Mountain, and, for a shorter distance, Full Mill Hill. It picks up Gap Run and Fisher Run {{from the left}}, Scotch Run from the right, and Furnace Run from the left in quick succession. After picking up Furnace Run, Catawissa Creek flows between Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain in a high, narrow gorge. As the creek leaves the gorge, it passes Mainville and enters a plain. The creek turns west-southwest and the plain narrows slightly. On {{the south side of}} the plain is Catawissa Mountain and on the north side are lower hills. After a few miles, the creek flows out of Main Township and into Catawissa Township. In Catawissa Township, the creek flows southwest to Catawissa. It follows <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of Catawissa until it reaches its edge and turns northwards, following the western border of Catawissa. Pennsylvania Route 487 crosses over the creek at this point. At the western edge of Catawissa, the creek empties into the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> between British Columbia and Alberta, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide, which meets the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak near {{the headwaters of the}} Columbia's Flathead River tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Coast Starlight began {{operating}} with Superliners in January 1981. The Sunset Limited, a long-distance train running along <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of the United States between Los Angeles and New Orleans, gained them in February, {{resulting in a}} commendation from the Texas State Legislature. The Pioneer gained Superliner coaches on April 26. The Eagle, an overnight train between San Antonio and Chicago, began carrying Superliners in October on those days it connected with the Sunset Limited in San Antonio. Superliner assignments became permanent in the 1990s. Amtrak estimated that reequipping a train with Superliners boosted ridership on it by 25%. The last car of the order, a sleeper delivered in July 1981, was also the last car ever built by Pullman, and was {{named in honor of}} the company's founder, George Mortimer Pullman.|$|E

5|$|The River Brue {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels {{to the east of}} the Polden Hills. It rises in hills near <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of the county, flows through Bruton, where it is joined by the River Pitt, and on through Baltonsborough. The lower reaches have been {{diverted}} into a channel that joins the Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea in Bridgwater Bay. There is a raised bog in the central Brue valley and the surrounding area is a mosaic of swamps, meres and alder woodland. The River Parrett rises in the hills around Chedington in Dorset and flows northwestwards past Aller, Somerset, and through the Somerset Levels to Bridgwater, after which it becomes an estuary with its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The river has a tidal bore, similar to that in the River Severn. The Somerset Levels are only a few feet above sea level and liable to flooding. They are drained by ditches and channels that drain into the Parrett including the King's Sedgemoor Drain, just south of the Polden Hills.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Trianon {{was signed}} in 1920, {{at the end of}} World War I, between the Allies of World War I and Hungary (as one of the {{successor}} states of Austria-Hungary). The treaty regulated the status of the independent Hungarian state and defined its borders. Compared to the prewar Kingdom of Hungary (as a part of Austria-Hungary), post-Trianon Hungary lost 72 percent of its territory. The principal beneficiaries of the territorial division of the prewar Kingdom of Hungary were Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The treaty established <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of Hungary along the Drava and Mura rivers (except in Baranya, where only {{the northern part of the}} county was retained by Hungary). On 4 December 1918 the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (comprising present-day Croatia) joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.|$|E
5|$|The area roughly {{located between}} the Danube, Tisza and Dniester rivers – {{approximately}} coinciding with modern-day Romania – became {{home to a}} varied group of Thracian peoples including Getae and Dacians sometime around the 7th to 6th centuries BC. The Getae and Dacians are related, but, distinct peoples that are sometimes treated as a single group {{under the name of}} Geto-Dacians. The Getae and Dacian peoples held many cultural and linguistic similarities. The Getae living in the lower Danube basin were able to establish regular trading commerce with the Greek cities along the coast of the Black Sea. The Dacians were located in the Carpatho-Danubian basin along <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of the Carpathian Mountains. This geographic isolation allowed the Dacians to survive catastrophic struggles – often with the Getae – and thrive to become the dominant tribe by the 1st century BC.|$|E
