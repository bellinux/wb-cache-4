40|$|Research {{into the}} use of natural {{resources}} and protected areas for the pursuit of outdoor recreational opportunities has been examined by a number of researchers. One activity with growth in recent years is river recreation, {{the use of}} rivers for rafting, kayaking, canoeing and instructional purposes. These many uses involve different groups of individuals, creating management complexity. Understanding the various inputs is critical for effective management The Lower Kananaskis River, located in Kananaskis Country in Southwestern Alberta, was area chosen to develop an understanding the inputs necessary for effective management. Specifically, this study explored the recreational use of the river in an effort to create recommendations on how to more effectively manage use of the Lower Kananaskis River and associated day-use facilities in the future. Kananaskis Country is a 4, 250 km 2 multi-use recreation area located in the Canadian Rocky Mountains on the western border of Alberta. Since its designation, the purpose of the area, has been to protect the natural features of the area while providing quality facilities that would complement recreational opportunities available in the area. Over the years, the multi-use goal of the area has led to issues surrounding the management of the recreational opportunities available, including the multiple use of the Lower Kananaskis River. The Lower Kananaskis River is a section of the larger Kananaskis River, one of six rivers flowing through Kananaskis Country. The Kananaskis River flows for 84 km. northward in the Kananaskis Country from the Upper Kananaskis Lake through the development of the Lower Kananaskis Lake and Barrier Lake to the Bow River. This thesis was only concerned about a small section of this river, the lower portion. The Lower Kananaskis River is a 2 km stretch of the river located within Bow Valley Provincial Park, with an additional 4 km of river outside of the park that many users utilize. This river has become a widely used and well-known recreational paddling destination in Kananaskis Country and Bow Valley Provincial Park and with this has come concerns over its use and management. A mixed methods approach was implemented to examine current use levels Both surveys and participant observations were used to develop a better understanding of current use levels (i. e. time, type) and to gather information from users. At the same time, structured interviews were held with key policy leaders to further explore current management issues and concerns surrounding the Lower Kananaskis River. Analysis of the data collected from river users revealed that the area is widely used by both commercial and recreational users. These two groups of users have learned to adapt to one another’s activities. Both groups expressed high level of satisfaction, but continued growth in use will probably pose problems with user’s experience and satisfaction. In many cases, users also recognized the need for improvements to river infrastructure {{both on and off the}} river. Users indicated that changes were needed in the parking areas to accommodate all of the vehicles and users, work was needed at the put-ins and <b>take-outs</b> to accommodate the increases in users along with work on the river features and at the day use sites. Users also recognized that the area is becoming more widely used and feel that changes are needed in how the area is maintained and managed in order to deal with its continued growth. The interviews with policy leaders emphasized the well-known nature of the issues of the area and emphasized issues within the current management structure. Policy leaders were more critical of the current management structure of the river than the users. The critical comments from the policy leaders were expected, as they are more aware of the management issues than recreational users. The policy leaders made many insightful comments for change in the interviews and recognize that park management has shown low levels of understanding and responses to the expressed needs of the users, and recommendations of previous research. This research found several examples of management ineffectiveness. It was concluded that the low levels of response from management is due to the lack of management capability. With the continued growth of the area new management demands can be expected. This in tern will require improved management framework and guideline. With this, it was recommended that increased management capability is required. In order to assist in the development of this capability the research developed an adapted outdoor recreation management framework. Application of this framework would help to ensure that the area is managed more effectively in the future...|$|R
40|$|Many BIM {{applications}} {{have been}} developed since the concept of BIM was first published decades ago. Increased use of BIM has been most noticeable from 2000 until today in Norway, but the use and the achieved utility value vary greatly, partly depending on the company size. BIM is most commonly used in the initial and closing phases of a project, while many choose {{to go back to}} traditional 2 D methods during the construction phase, creating a black hole in the BIM implementation process. This can cause duplication of work, which can reduce the potential time, cost and quality benefits BIM offers. Is it true that the benefits from implementing BIM in the construction phase doesn t make up for the efforts it requires? This master thesis attempts to convince the AEC industry that utilizing BIM in all project phases can contribute to optimize planning, communication and analyzing in ways that exceed the abilities of traditional implementation methods. The researcher partnered with Rambøll Norge AS for this research work. They have so far not fully implemented BIM in the construction phase of their projects, but have expressed that they wish to change this. Their desire was the triggering factor for this research work. The researcher did a pilot study in fall 2014. Knowledge gained during the pilot study helped shape the research topic and the research questions, which read as follows: 	What are the benefits and challenges with using BIM in the construction phase? 	What actions are necessary to increase the utility value of BIM in all project phases? 	Who should be responsible for implementing the actions? Currently experienced benefits and challenges with using BIM in all project phases must be identified as well as actions necessary to increase the benefits and reduce the challenges, in order to fulfill this research s purpose: Finding arguments in favor of using BIM in all project phases, and attempt to diminish the above-mentioned black hole. A construction project has a limited duration and is the sum of a unique product, the project organization and the construction processes necessary to achieve completion. Projects supereminent objective is to satisfy the clients needs within the constraints of cost, duration, and quality objectives. Client acceptance of the final product is the key variable, as it clarifies if a project fulfilled its intended purpose. This thesis focused on the construction phase, but the transitions from preceding and to proceeding phases were still of some interest. A Building Information Model can briefly be defined as an intelligent, digital 3 D model incorporated with the building component information necessary to build the building. Building Information Modeling is the processes involving the generation and management of Building Information Models. The 3 D model provides for enhanced visualization, model walkthroughs, and collision detection. A 4 D model provides for the ability to plan, schedule, monitor, and manage a project. A 5 D model provides for quantity <b>take-outs,</b> and real-time and life cycle cost estimation. The 6 D model provides for energy calculations and analyses, and addresses environmental strain. A 7 D model provides for facility management, operation and maintenance, and life-cycle analysis. This research work was carried out using an inductive research approach and qualitative research methods to collect data. An extensive literature search, a brief document study, and twelve semi-structured open-ended interviews of experienced BIM users involved in one of the two case projects were conducted to collect data for this research. The group of interviewees consisted of: Four people with roles in the client s project administration, three discipline consulting engineers, one architect, two people with roles in the contractor s project management, one BIM technician and one BIM technician professor. The interviewees were asked to elaborate on the benefit and challenges they have experienced concerning these aspects in BIM projects: Phase transitions, responsibility distribution, analytical features, information sharing, communication, visualization, collaboration and cooperation, lean construction, waste reduction, and schedule and budget planning and monitoring. They were also asked to recommend necessary actions to increase the utility value of BIM, and to name the parties they see as responsible for implementing the actions. Many of the benefits the interviewees claimed to have experienced are made possible due to the greatly enhanced visualization digital BIM models offer: Performance analyses, error detection, quantity summation, work activity identification, verification of constructability, increased predictability, waste reduction, higher quality project products, and a more efficient construction process through free flow of information, constant model access and improved communication. Their claims are supported by literature reviewed in the literature study. The interviewees each mentioned, on several occasions, that the AEC industry s lack of BIM interest, lack of willingness to adopt new tools and processes, and low level of BIM skills are incredibly damaging to the implementation of BIM. Proposed actions to reduce these challenges included increasing people s BIM interest and level of BIM skills, which may be solved locally. Individual companies could arrange training seminars for their employees, but employees {{have to be willing to}} adopt BIM. Research on the overall utility value of BIM or the expected savings of cost and time from implementing the construction phase utilizing BIM tools and BIM processes may contribute to convince AEC industry participants nation-wide. The latter is also one of the researcher s recommended future research topics. Some more comprehensive challenges were also uncovered during the interviews. BIM tools and BIM processes have in many cases simply been applied to traditional project implementation methods and contract strategies. Appropriate levels of detail in BIM models and intended use of models are seldom specified in contract agreements. The interviewees would like to see the government, buildingSMART or Standard Norge step in and announce standard BIM applications and information exchange systems, and establish standards for how BIM should be implemented and how BIM should be included in contract agreements. One of the interview questions dealt with combining BIM and budget planning and monitoring. None of the interviewees were able to give well-justified answers, as none of them have had any previous success actually combining the two...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary Innovation in {{information}} technology (IT) has changed the way economic activity is carried out and organised. The eventual macroeconomic outcome of these changes and the macroeconomic profile of an IT-based economy are still uncertain. The major global correction in equity prices of IT companies, the dramatic cutbacks in IT investment and the abrupt deterioration in business conditions in the United States and elsewhere have all contributed to {{the sense that the}} structural changes in the economy may well be smaller and less beneficial than some of the most enthusiastic proponents of the "new economy" had argued. Since the contribution of the most recent wave of IT development has not been observed over a full business cycle, the outcome remains uncertain. But evidence of structural changes in different countries is abundantly available at the microeconomic level, with implications for firms’ financial structure and the character of financial intermediation. By improving the availability and dissemination of information, IT has the potential to act as a catalyst for fundamental changes in production processes and in the competitive environment within and outside the IT sector. IT facilitates more customised production based on flexible work processes. This involves firm reorganisation that allows IT and human capital to be combined in an efficient way. As a consequence of these skill-biased production changes, intangible and non-marketable assets such as intellectual property rights and firm-specific knowledge gain in importance. In addition, incorporating performance-based incentives into compensation schemes becomes more prevalent. This fundamental transformation of the firm is mirrored by changes in the household sector. Households tend to assume more business risk both through the provision of capital and, in tendency, also through labour income. These trends have implications for the financing needs of firms and the confidence with which firms’ performance can be assessed and foreseen. Firm reorganisation towards "soft" and customised production tends to increase idiosyncratic risks. And simultaneous changes in the competitive environment and in business models may alter the risk-reward profile of firms quickly and in an unpredictable way. In tendency, the need increases for capital that bears business risk and for corporate governance structures that create incentives to adapt to new ways of production. This suggests a greater role for equity and for financial contracts that incorporate equity characteristics. Corporate financing patterns support the notion of an increasing role for equity and equity-like instruments in the financing of both new and established firms. Venture capital has offered a way to combine funding of high-risk projects and managerial support in a flexible way for new and innovative firms, which typically lack collateral, track record and managerial experience. Established firms in the IT sector, but also in other industries, have increasingly relied on public equity and on debt instruments incorporating equity characteristics such as convertible bonds, issuance in the high-yield segment of the bond market, coupon step-up clauses or bank loans with terms contingent on the borrower’s performance. The boom and bust in the IT segment of equity markets has clearly influenced external funding, but factors like the establishment of new instruments and markets for equities or related instruments suggest that there will be lasting effects. Generally, the character and the role of different financial arrangements can be expected to change according to the altering risk-return profile and financing preferences of firms. In addition to modifications in the design of financial contracts, this would include adjustments in the valuation techniques applied by financial intermediaries and in the management of risks and exposures. One example is an increasing specialisation of intermediaries in financing firms in different stages of the corporate life cycle. Another may be greater reliance on credit risk transfer in order to achieve the desired diversification of portfolios. The boom and bust of IT equities and their impact on the financial system highlight several important issues raised in this study. First, on the positive side the huge loss in equity wealth has not triggered any major default among financial intermediaries. This suggests that the shift of risk from financial intermediaries to investors in financial markets through increasing reliance of firms on market-based financing has provided for a better, more dispersed allocation of risks across sectors that have been able to bear them. This possibly includes the diffusion of IT-related credit exposures through credit risk transfer markets. Overall, business-related risks seem to have been distributed more broadly across the economy. Second, valuation problems have been substantial and were probably exacerbated by market practices - eg with respect to IPOs - that might not have dealt appropriately with the specific information and valuation problems that characterise new and innovative firms. Looking ahead, greater relevance of firm-specific risks and difficulties in evaluating them is likely to affect volatility clusters in financial markets and in particular in equity markets. While overall market volatility need not necessarily be higher, heightened price volatility of individual stocks could become a persistent phenomenon. With rising idiosyncratic risk, diversification may require larger portfolios and more widely ranged exposures than before to generate desired levels of risk. Third, equity market conditions had considerable knock-on effects for other segments of the financial system. The decline of IT equity prices impacted adversely on the provision of venture capital and private equity to high-tech firms. The drop in equity market capitalisation also reduced the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to provide new finance to these sectors, as the validity of earlier assumptions about the ease of refinancing existing debt finance through equity markets was undermined. As equity market valuation is likely to become more central, fluctuations in equity prices would be easily transmitted to other markets. One transmission channel that may involve risk is the reliance on the equity market capitalisation of a firm as an indicator of its future earning capacity and hence its ability to service debt. Fourth, the difficulties associated with the assessment of credit risk involved in financing innovative activities became apparent. A case in point is the telecoms sector. The quality of telecoms debt declined rapidly and the inability of some telecoms companies to arrange equity market <b>take-outs</b> of bank debt and rising defaults left banks with unanticipated exposures. More generally, in a climate of rapid technological change and intense competition, banks may face a rapidly evolving credit risk environment. Correlation of risk factors among sectors will change when industries expand into new markets. As a consequence, issues related to sectoral exposures or an increasing reliance on credit risk transfer tools would become increasingly relevant. And technological change challenges the reliability of backward-looking indicators (such as default histories) for credit risk assessment. In a longer-term perspective, these experiences can be seen as part of a learning process for all participants, which may have led to significant improvements in risk management and valuation capability. However, the tentative nature of these arguments should be recognised, as it is still too early to draw final conclusions about the implications of the IT sector boom, its subsequent bust and its future course. Reconsidering and reassessing these implications should be the subject of future investigations. The general issue for public policy {{in the face of a}} technological shock is to strike the right balance between exploiting potential gains and avoiding risks that could threaten the overall system. Financing plays a role in supporting the reorganisation of the corporate sector and in allocating the risks associated with this process. And this role is likely to increase as market-based incentive mechanisms gain in importance and the management of financial risks becomes more complex. Main risks involved in the financing of new technologies are large-scale failures of investment projects that may damage the financial institutions providing funding and excessive price movements in financial markets resulting from unrealistic expectations. Against this background, the task of financial policy is to set a framework of standards and guidelines that allows for market-driven adjustment of financing mechanisms and encourages ongoing improvement in risk management techniques. Central banks can play an active role in this process. One aspect of this role is employing the research capabilities and the knowledge of the financial system combined in central banks to improve the understanding of the financial impact of technological change. The other aspect is active monitoring of the financial system. Changing linkages between the real and the financial sphere and across the different segments of the financial system, and in particular the reallocation of risks across the financial system, underline the need for systemic monitoring. ...|$|R

500|$|Part of the product's format {{was in its}} packaging, {{which was}} {{designed}} to fit in a car cup holder. The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States at the time. Since most of the fast food industry's business is <b>take-out</b> or drive-thru traffic, this allowed the convenience food purchaser to drive and eat with little effort. With the introduction of the BK Chicken Fries, BK began adapting some of its other product packaging so that it could also be placed in an automotive cup holder. In addition to the Chicken Fries container, the company added a trademarked and patented, round French fry container which it calls the [...] "FryPod", which is a paper cup made from 50 percent recycled materials that is also designed to fit in an automotive cup holder. The package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition hosted by the Quick Service Restaurant division of the Foodservice and Packaging Institute in 2007.|$|E
