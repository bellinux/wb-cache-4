Each train would cost 50million Norwegian krone (NOK), and NSB had 28 months to use their option. NSB's CEO, Osmund Ueland, stated that Ansaldo had been chosen because they had the best <b>technical</b> <b>offer</b> and had by far the lowest price. The new trains would have 35% lower maintenance costs and use 33% less electricity than the Class 69. The new trains would also have a higher maximum speed, have wider doors and make less noise. The electronics would be delivered by Ansaldo, the superstructure by Breda and the bogies by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM). The estimated date of delivery for the trains was from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2001. The exterior and interior design was made by Pininfarina, with assistance from NSB's own designers. The latter were used to tailor the design to the Norwegian public's preferences, which among other things involved use of wood in the interior. [...] At the time, Ansaldo also had an order for the Oslo Tramway's SL95.|$|E

5000|$|A match {{consists}} of a mix between short courses (lowest number of targets), medium and long courses (highest number of targets). The approved balance for a match is a ratio of 3 short courses to 2 medium courses and 1 long course (i.e. 6 short, 4 medium and 2 long courses for a level 3 match). Since the number of targets dictate the available points for that stage, and therefore Long courses potentially can have a have great impact on the overall standings. Short courses have fewer points available, and tend not to be as critical for the overall standings. Short courses are often more <b>technical,</b> <b>offer</b> many different stage solutions, or include challenging elements such as [...] "empty chamber" [...] or [...] "empty magazine well" [...] starts, or [...] "non-freestyle shooting" [...] elements such as strong or weak hand only. Medium courses are something in between, while long courses will have the highest round count. Long courses {{tend to be more}} freestyle and straightforward as far as different stage solutions. The shooting challenges may still not necessarily be easy, and a match can be lost or won at a long course since there are so many points available.|$|E

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation was first baldly referred {{by the supreme}} judiciary {{in this country in}} North South Property Ltd.v. Ministry of Land and another (2000). Here, the respondent (Ministry of Land) took up a project for construction of 16000 flatsfor shelter less and low income group slum dwellers of the Dhaka city. The Government planned to do it on 47.90 acres of Government land at Bhasantek through private financing of the developers. The respondents had discussion with different developers including the petitioner. The petitioner was assured of being engaged to execute the said project and was asked to submit a detailed lay out plan in this regard. The petitioner did all those things as the respondent instructed. Subsequently, the respondents published a notice inviting bids for executing the said project. Only two companies including the petitioner participated in the said bid and it was unanimously resolved in the concerned committee that the <b>technical</b> <b>offer</b> of the petitioner was responsive. But the respondents decided not to accept petitioner‟s lone bid as the participants were only two. They decided to call a fresh bid to make the process competitive and transparent. The petitioner challenged the decision of the authority {{on the basis of his}} legitimate expectation that arose on the assurance given by the authority to employ him for the project and his spending an amount of taka twenty-five lac to develop and finalise the plans and technical support on the basis of such assurance. The facts of the case in itself can be a good example in explaining the criteria of [...] "clear, unequivocal and unambiguous‟ statement or promise by a public authority. But the court did not go to the depth of the issues of [...] "assurance‟ or [...] "understanding‟ as claimed by the petitioner rather termed the claim of legitimate expectation as [...] "adisputed question".|$|E

40|$|New {{researches}} about housing consider sustainability {{issue to}} get a general improvement of people’s quality life. Recent laws on energy requirement for buildings, the application of EU Directive 2002 / 91 /CE, and the consequent fall-out on building activities are coming together to create {{an awareness of the}} added economic value of a building’s improved energy effectiveness; this driven effect will tend to act as a lever to trigger more appropriate responses in terms of setting as well as structures, involving the evaluation of energy consumption, the level of comfort of the inhabitants, the production of harmful substances and rubbish, and the rationalisation of the use of water resources. All this however is meeting a certain resistance on the production side, in particular with the baggage of skills and capabilities of builders and planners who often approach residential building, drawing on an inheritance of well-established technological and morphological solutions, thus rendering banal the <b>technical</b> <b>offer</b> of the market and standardising the panorama of the expanding city. The current legal situation values envelope solutions in terms of thermal conduction, without consider characteristics of materials that constitute it. The market offers a lot of solutions for insulating materials, different for typology, performances, possibility of use and production system. For this reason, it’s necessary to promote an evaluation of the general characteristics of the products. It’s necessary to value the satisfaction of inside comfort’s levels of the building reported to thermal and acoustic isolation’s performances; and also it’s important to consider the possibility to use the material in different way according to building’s orientation and climatic area. Finally, it is necessary to value how much the production and the use of a material can produce consequences on the surrounding environment. The PEI value of the material, consequential from the LCA, offers information about the consumption of primary energy and available resources utilized to produce and use the material. Materials and technical solutions evaluated according to these criteria may contribute to improve the energy efficiency of the building system and, at the same time, can be evaluated, also observing the consequences which the use of a solution may have on the environment and the ecosystem, beyond a simple evaluation of their use in thermal insulation...|$|E
