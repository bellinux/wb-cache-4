50|$|The western green mamba's natural prey {{consists}} {{mainly of}} birds and small mammals, including rodents such as mice, rats, and squirrels. Other mammals include bats, <b>tree</b> <b>pangolins,</b> and shrews. They also feed on lizards, frogs, and bird eggs. This snake pursues its prey, striking rapidly and often until the prey succumbs to the venom.|$|R
50|$|Other mammals {{seen in the}} {{sanctuary}} include: black panther (rare), sloth bear (rare, occasional sightings near caves and grasslands), Indian gaur (commonly sighted near the grasslands, in forest clearings, and near water), barking deer (commonly sighted near forest clearings and waterholes), sambar deer (occasionally sighted on grasslands and main roads), leopard (extremely rare), ruddy mongoose (frequently sighted at daybreak and dusk on forest paths), Asian palm civet (commonly sighted on main roads and near village settlements), small Indian civet (commonly sighted on main roads, dhole (rarely sighted transient mammal in the forests), jungle cat (extremely rare, sighted by researchers and locals on a few occasions), mouse deer (rare, occasional sightings on trails), wild boar (frequently sighted at dawn and dusk), Indian hare (commonly sighted on the plateaux), giant squirrel (documented in the forests), flying squirrel (a nocturnal mammal, documented in dense evergreen forests), black-faced langur (commonly found in small groups in the <b>tree</b> canopy), Indian <b>pangolin</b> (rarely found in secondary forests), slender loris (rare and endangered), bonnet macaque (commonly found in troupes).|$|R

5000|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> {{had belonged}} to the genus Manis and {{subgenus}} Phataginus before Phataginus was elevated to generic status. Two subspecies were recognized in 1972 by Meester: ...|$|E
50|$|Some species, {{such as the}} <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin,</b> {{use their}} strong, prehensile tails to hang from tree {{branches}} and strip away bark from the trunk, exposing insect nests inside.|$|E
50|$|Other animals present {{include the}} long-tailed pangolin, giant pangolin, <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin,</b> Angolan slender mongoose, aquatic genet, hippopotamus, the African golden cat, bushpig, bongo, yellow-backed duiker, sitatunga, okapi, bushbuck, water chevrotain and forest buffalo.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Phataginus tricuspis) is one {{of eight}} extant species of {{pangolins}} ("scaly anteaters"), and is native to equatorial Africa. Also known as the white-bellied pangolin or three-cusped pangolin, {{it is the most}} common of the African forest pangolins.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> {{can walk}} {{on all fours}} or {{on its hind legs}} using its prehensile tail for balance. It can climb up trees in the absence of branches. When walking on all fours, it walks on its front {{knuckles}} with its claws tucked underneath to protect them from wearing down. Its anal scent glands disperse a foul secretion much like a skunk when threatened. It has a well-developed sense of smell, but as a nocturnal animal, it has poor eyesight. Instead of teeth, it has a gizzard-like stomach full of stones and sand it ingests. The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> in Africa fills its stomach with air before entering water to aid in buoyancy for well-developed swimming.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> is semiarboreal and {{generally}} nocturnal. It {{is found in}} lowland tropical moist forests (both primary and secondary), as well as savanna/forest mosaics. It probably adapts to some degree to habitat modification, as it favours cultivated and fallow land where it is not aggressively hunted (e.g., abandoned or little-used oil palm trees in secondary growth).|$|E
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> {{ranges from}} Guinea through Sierra Leone {{and much of}} West Africa to Central Africa as far east as extreme southwestern Kenya and northwestern Tanzania. To the south, it extends to {{northern}} Angola and northwestern Zambia. It has been found on the Atlantic island of Bioko, but no records confirm a presence in Senegal, Gambia, or Guinea-Bissau.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{that occur}} in the park include bush pig, duikers, bushbuck, African clawless otter, mongoose, giant African water shrew, squirrels, <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin,</b> porcupine, bats and a variety of {{primates}} including the blue monkey, redtail monkey, De Brazza's monkey, baboon, potto and the occasional vervet monkey. Leopards have been occasionally reported, but the last official sighting was in 1991.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{population}} of the vulnerable white-throated guenon, a primate.Although no thorough study of the primate population has been done since 1982, chimpanzees were reported {{to be present in}} the region in 2009.The number of chimpanzees estimated to live in the Okomu Forest reserve was guessed to be 25-50 in 2003, and some may use the national park at times.Other animals found in the park include dwarf crocodiles, red river hog, sitatunga, warthog, civet cat, Maxwell's duiker, grass cutter, mona monkey, Thomas's galago and <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> {{is subject}} to {{widespread}} and often intensive exploitation for bushmeat and traditional medicine, and {{is by far the}} most common of the pangolins found in African bushmeat markets. Conservationists believe this species underwent a decline of 20-25% between 1993 and 2008 (three pangolin generations) due mainly to the impact of the bushmeat hunting. They assert it continues to be harvested at unsustainable levels in some of its range, and by 2008 had elevated its status from [...] "Least Concern" [...] to [...] "Near Threatened".|$|E
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> eats insects such as ants and {{termites}} {{from their}} nests, or {{the armies of}} insects moving on the trees. It relies on its thick skin for protection, and digs into burrows with its long, clawed forefeet. It eats between 5 and 7 ounces (150 to 200 g) of insects a day. The pangolin uses its 10- to 27-in (250- to 700-mm) tongue which is coated with gummy mucus to funnel the insects into its mouth. The tongue is actually sheathed in the chest cavity {{all the way to}} the pelvic area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> {{has many}} adaptations. When threatened, it rolls {{up into a}} ball, {{protecting}} itself with its thick skin and scales. Its scales cover its entire body except for the belly, snout, eyes, ears, and undersides of the limbs. When a mother with young is threatened, she rolls up around the young, which also roll into a ball. While in a ball, she can extend her scales and make a cutting action by using muscles to move the scales back and forth. She makes an aggressive huff noise when threatened, {{but that is the}} extent of her noise-making.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} Burkina Faso include aardvark, African bush elephant, African civet, African clawless otter, African golden cat, African ground squirrel, West African wild dog, western dwarf buffalo, bushbuck, Cape hare, Cape hyrax, caracal, Northwest African cheetah, common chimpanzee, common genet, Dorcas gazelle, fennec fox, four-toed hedgehog, giant pangolin, West African giraffe, Egyptian wolf, grivet, Guinea baboon, hamadryas baboon, Haussa genet, hippopotamus, African leopard, West African lion, olive baboon, oribi, pale fox, patas monkey, ratel, red-fronted gazelle, reedbuck, roan antelope, rusty-spotted genet, Senegal bushbaby, serval, side-striped jackal, slender {{mongoose}}, speckle-throated otter, spotted hyena, striped hyena, striped polecat, sun squirrel, <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin,</b> warthog, water chevrotain, western hartebeest, white-tailed mongoose and wildcat.|$|E
50|$|The forests {{have been}} home {{to a variety of}} mammals {{including}} the African forest elephant, lion and cheetah, but uncontrolled hunting may have completely removed these. Remaining mammals include the yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus sylvicultor), black-fronted duiker (Cephalophus nigrifrons), blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola), and smaller species such as the <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Phataginus tricuspis), Beecroft's flying squirrel and forest giant squirrel. In the dry season animals migrate to the moister areas uphill.Larger mammals, which are found especially in the drier grasslands rather than the forests on the ridge, include roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), southern reedbuck (Redunca arundinum), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and eland (Taurotragus oryx).|$|E
50|$|Long-tailed {{pangolins}} are a solitary, shy species. They {{communicate with}} other members of their species using pheromones that are produced in a pair of anal scent glands. The pheromones in the exudate are likely used to attract mates and establish territorial edges. They are the only species of pangolin known to be diurnal, which may be a method of avoiding food competition with its sister species, the <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Manis tricuspis). They have developed a number of antipredatory mechanisms to protect themselves, such as pythons and leopards, starting with their scales, which act as camouflage. When threatened, long-tailed pangolin roll themselves into a tight ball, exposing only their sharp scales. They may also emit a foul-smelling fluid from their anal glands. They have been observed sleeping in this rolled-up posture in tree hollows and epiphytes.|$|E
50|$|Also found are two bats, Buettikofer's epauletted {{fruit bat}} (Epomops buettikoferi) and Aellen's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros marisae), Pel's flying {{squirrel}} (Anomalurus peli), giant pangolin (Manis gigantea), <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Manis tricuspis) and long-tailed pangolin (Manis tetradactyla), Liberian mongoose (Liberiictus kuhni), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), leopard (Panthera pardus), African forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), which in 2001 numbered only about 100 {{individuals in the}} south of the park compared to some 1,800 in 1979, red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni ivoriensis), dwarf or pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) numbered at around 500 in 1996 {{is one of the few}} viable populations remaining, water chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus) and an exceptional variety of forest duikers including Jentink's duiker (Cephalophus jentinki), banded or zebra duiker (Cephalophus zebra), Maxwell's duiker (Cephalophus maxwelii), Ogilby's duiker (Cephalophus ogilbyi), black duiker (Cephalophus niger), bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus sylvicultor) and the royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus). Forest rodents include the rusty-bellied brush-furred rat (Lophuromys sikapusi), the Edward's swamp rat (Malacomys edwardsi) and the woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus). Also recorded in the park is Stochomys defua, which is characteristic of secondary forest.|$|E
40|$|Microarchitectural adaptations in {{the stomach}} of african <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Manis tricuspis). Int. J. Morphol., 26 (3) : 701 - 705, 2008. SUMMARY: The {{microarchitecture}} of the pangolin’s stomach favouring the high chitinous diet has been less waived into, despite extensive morphological investigations. Histological analysis of the microanatomy will provide powerful tools for interpretation to yield reliable insights. We investigated this by fixing the tissues in 10 % formol saline for histological analysis. Serial sections at 5 µm thickness were subjected to general staining methods for light microscopic study (Haematoxylin and eosin, Van Gieson’s and Verhoeff’s). The results revealed basic structural arrangements in their coats, with a modification of the epithelial lining of cardia and fundus into stratified squamous keratinized epithelium. These modifications {{were also reflected in}} the distribution of collagen and elastic fibers in the various layers (coats) of the stomach. The present study has shown that there was an adaptation of the stomach of African <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> to its diet as reflected in the microarchitectural configuration...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{polymorphic}} dinucleotide microsatellite loci {{were developed}} in the Malayan pangolin Manis javanica. Of the 34 markers, 32 and 18 were also amplified, respectively, in the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) and the African <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Manis tricuspis). Analysis of 24 Malayan, 12 Chinese and 2 African tree pangolins showed high levels of variability (heterozygosity ranging from 0. 321 to 0. 708). These are the first available microsatellite markers in Pholidota and will be an invaluable tool for evolutionary and conservation genetic studies in pangolins...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{describes}} a collection of mammals from the Ikelenge pedicle of the Mwinilunga District, northwest Zambia. This comprises 140 specimens of 20 species collected between 22 September and 12 October 1990, including the third specimen of <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin</b> Manis tricuspis known from Zambia, and the fourth known specimen of the musk shrew, Crocidura ansellorum, endemic to northwest Zambia. The second part of the paper highlights the biodiversity of this region and discusses its conservation. The biogeography of the Ikelenge pedicle is discussed with respect to its exceptional biodiversity. A review of indicator species of vertebrates, Lepidoptera and Odonata emphasizes the global and national significance of the area’s biodiversity resulting from the dominant influence of forest species of Guineo-Congolian affinity and also from those species endemic to the area. The presence of these endemics provides evidence for a region of endemism. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} basic {{data on the}} species richness, spatial distributions, and densities of large- and medium-sized mammals in two Community Hunting Zones (CHZs 13 and 14) located in the northern periphery of Boumba-Bek National Park, southeastern Cameroon. The survey was conducted along 126 2 -km transects and 101 recce walkways between transects, over a total of 398 km. A total of 31 species, or groups of species, of large- and medium-sized mammals were observed. The highest encounter rates (ERs) were recorded for red duikers (8. 74 signs/km), blue duiker (6. 12), and brush-tailed porcupine (4. 42). Relatively high ERs (0. 5 or more) were observed for elephant, red river hog, <b>tree</b> <b>pangolin,</b> yellow-backed duiker, and gorilla. Human activities including hunting and snaring were widely observed in the study area. Spatial distribution analysis revealed that different species were affected differently by human activities. In CHZ 13, an area more populated by humans, populations of red duikers and red river hog, important game animals for the local people, appeared to have decreased. In contrast, duikers and red river hog remained in CHZ 14 at similar levels as in the neighboring national parks. These results suggest that areas neighboring the park can exist in different stages of animal deterioration; therefore, the situation should be examined carefully to elaborate an effective wildlife management model that contributes {{not only to the}} conservation of biodiversity but also to the sustainable use of bushmeat by local people...|$|E
