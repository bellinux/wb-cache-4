5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as a victim of <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{was one of}} {{the first}} native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari. Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which {{resulted}} in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with them new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.|$|E
5|$|The Exopterygota likely are paraphyletic {{in regard}} to the Endopterygota. Matters that have {{incurred}} controversy include Strepsiptera and Diptera grouped together as Halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological community. The Neuropterida are often lumped or split on <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the taxonomist. Fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid mecopterans. Many questions remain in the basal relationships among endopterygote orders, particularly the Hymenoptera.|$|E

5|$|The rush of {{technology}} and the commercialisation of agriculture {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{staged by}} Ichikawa Danjūrō I in 1697 at the Nakamura-za, {{it was very}} popular, and quickly began to be {{included}} at the annual kaomise celebrations of each theatre in Edo. For a time, the main role was frequently different, depending on <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the theatre and the troupe. The piece was standardized somewhat in the early 19th century by Danjūrō VII, and reworked again by Danjūrō IX {{at the end of}} that century. This version has been performed since then.|$|E

25|$|It {{is likely}} that Exopterygota is paraphyletic in regard to Endopterygota.

25|$|As the conference's {{decisions}} were enacted unilaterally, and largely on <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the Big Four, for its duration Paris was effectively {{the center of}} a world government, which deliberated over and implemented the sweeping changes to the political geography of Europe. Most famously, the Treaty of Versailles itself weakened Germany's military and placed full blame for the war and costly reparations on its shoulders– the humiliation and resentment in Germany is sometimes considered as one of the causes of Nazi success and indirectly a cause of World War II.|$|E
25|$|When in the 19th century Renaissance style {{architecture}} {{came into}} vogue, it often materialized {{not just in}} its original form according to geography, but as a hybrid of all its earlier forms according to <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> architects and patrons rather than geography and culture. If this were not confusing enough, the new Neo-Renaissance then frequently borrowed architectural elements from the succeeding Mannerist period, {{and in many cases}} the even later Baroque period. Mannerism and Baroque being two very opposing styles of architecture. Mannerism was exemplified by the Palazzo del Te and Baroque by the Wurzburg Residenz.|$|E

25|$|If {{there were}} any Frisii left in Frisia, they fell victim to <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> nature, civil strife and piracy. After several hundred years of {{favorable}} conditions, the natural environment in the low-lying coastal regions of northwestern Europe began to deteriorate c. 250 AD and gradually worsened over the next 200 years. Rising sea levels and storm surges combined to flood some areas. Many deserted village sites were silted over. The situation was probably aggravated by a shift to a cooler, wetter climate {{in the region as}} well as by the introduction of malaria and other epidemic diseases.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} before 1856, {{want and need}} of a passage over the Ohio River was apparent. Commerce between Ohio and Kentucky could not {{continue}} unless some form of transportation was devised that did not bow to <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> mother nature. The distance from shore to shore was great and the steamboat traffic highly congested. The only solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a wire cable suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France.|$|E
25|$|It was {{regarded}} as mandatory of a pope-elect to seek the confirmation of his appointment from Constantinople before consecration, often resulting in extremely lengthy delays (Sabinian: 6 months; Boniface III: 1 year; Boniface IV: 10 months; Boniface V: 13 months), due {{to the difficulty of}} travel, the Byzantine bureaucracy, and <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the emperors. Disputes were often theological; for example, Severinus was not consecrated for 20 months after his election due to his refusal to accept monothelitism, dying only months after he finally received permission to be consecrated in 640. When Greek Pope Theodore attempted to excommunicate two Patriarchs of Constantinople for supporting monothelitism, imperial troops looted the papal treasury in the Lateran Palace, arrested and exiled the papal aristocracy at the imperial court, and desecrated the altar of the papal residence in Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} types of stories among many {{indigenous}} communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve {{as a means to}} exchange information. These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about cultural values and lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are often told {{the story of a young}} man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.|$|E
25|$|However, film-making in the GDR {{was always}} {{constrained}} and oriented {{by the political}} situation {{in the country at}} any given time. Ernst Thälmann, the communist leader in the Weimar period, was the subject of several hagiographical films in the 1950s (Ernst Thälmann, 1954), and although East German filmmaking moved away from this overtly Stalinist approach in the 1960s, filmmakers were still subject to the changing political positions, and indeed <b>the</b> <b>whims,</b> <b>of</b> the SED leadership. For example, DEFA's full slate of contemporary films from 1966 were denied distribution, among them Frank Beyer's Traces of Stones (1966) which was pulled from distribution after three days, not because it was antipathetic to communist principles, but because it showed that such principles, which it fostered, were not put into practice at all times in East Germany. The huge box-office hit The Legend of Paul and Paula was initially threatened with a distribution ban because of its satirical elements and supposedly only allowed a release on the say-so of Party General Secretary Erich Honecker.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has {{other things to}} do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that {{there will not be a}} problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E

500|$|The {{cost of the}} {{construction}} of Holkham is thought to have been in the region of £90,000. This vast cost nearly ruined the heirs of the 1st Earl, but had the result that they were financially unable to alter the house to suit <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> taste. Thus, the house has remained almost untouched since its completion in 1764.

500|$|Crucially, {{martial law}} as then {{understood}} {{was not a}} form of substantive law, but instead a suspension {{of the rule of}} law; it was the replacement of normal statutes with a law based on <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> <b>of</b> the local military commander. It was, however, based on certain firm rules, primarily that it should only be used [...] "in time of war or open rebellion in the realm". In previous reigns, this had not been a problem, with monarchs such as Elizabeth I instituting martial law without issues. Charles, however, lacked both the public popularity of Elizabeth and the support within Parliament, and his justification for martial law was not as sound. As a result, the opposition in Parliament, already aggrieved with his behaviour, was further inflamed.|$|E
