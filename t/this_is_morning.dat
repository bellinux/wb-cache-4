This change so resembles the last, that I wonder they do not observe it. The Secretary sent for me yesterday to dine with him, but I was abroad; I hope {{he had something to}} say to me. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>morning,</b> and I write in bed. I am going to the Duke of Ormond, whom I have not yet seen. Morrow, sirrahs.--At night. I was to see the Duke of Ormond this morning: he asked me two or three questions after his civil way, and they related to Ireland: at last I told him that, from the time I had seen him, I never once thought of Irish affairs. He whispered me that he hoped I had done some good things here: I said, if everybody else had done half as much, we should not be as we are: then we went aside, and talked over affairs. I told him how all things stood, and advised him what was to be done. I then went and sat an hour with the Duchess; then as long with Lady Oglethorpe,(17) who is so cunning a devil that I believe she could yet find a remedy, if they would take her advice. I dined with a friend at Court.|$|E
