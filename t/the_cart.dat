5|$|In 2008, CART {{became the}} 39th public {{transportation}} {{system in the}} United States to be featured on Google Transit, a website that allows transportation users to electronically plan their travel routes. In 2010, CART buses were modified to include a GPS tracking system that allows riders to see the location of buses and their predicted arrival times via <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> and Google websites. CART buses transport more than 1.3million travelers annually.|$|E
5|$|Payton pursued various {{business}} ventures in retirement, including becoming co-owner of Dale Coyne Racing in <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> IndyCar World Series. He also drove in several Trans-Am Series events, including a 1993 race at Road America {{in which his}} car overturned and caught fire. He suffered burns but escaped serious injury.|$|E

50|$|In {{many places}} in the United States and the United Kingdom, {{customers}} are allowed to leave <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> in designated areas within the parking lot, and store personnel will return <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> to <b>the</b> storage area. In many continental European premises, however, coin- (or token-) operated locking mechanisms are provided to encourage shoppers to return <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> to <b>the</b> correct location after use.|$|R
50|$|The Greenock Road (A8), between Inchinnan and Renfrew, {{passes over}} <b>the</b> White <b>Cart</b> Water {{by means of}} the Swing Bridge. <b>The</b> White <b>Cart</b> Water then joins with <b>the</b> Black <b>Cart</b> Water, just {{downstream}} of the bridge, to become <b>the</b> River <b>Cart.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plain arms {{also often}} {{function}} as a disguise for major characters. In the Chrétien de Troyes' Lancelot, the Knight of <b>the</b> <b>Cart,</b> Lancelot bears plain red arms as a disguise. The hero of Cligès competes in a jousting tournament with plain black, green, and red arms on three successive days (Brault, 30).|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} cameo {{appearances}} by Charlton Heston (uncredited) as Zaius, Thade's father, and Linda Harrison (the woman in <b>the</b> <b>cart).</b> Both participated in two original {{films in the}} series, Planet of the Apes (1968) and Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) as George Taylor and Nova, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), the {{punishment}} for parricide was basically made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead. Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in the fourth century CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> with the sack and its live contents was driven by black oxen.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>carts</b> were {{introduced}} to the island by <b>the</b> ancient Greeks. <b>Carts</b> reached <b>the</b> height of their popularity in the 1920s, when many thousand were on <b>the</b> island. Miniature <b>carts,</b> or Carrettini Siciliani, are often sold in Sicily (or in Italian shops and restaurants in other countries) as souvenirs. The Museo del Carretto Siciliano, in Terrasini, in the province of Palermo, is a museum dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>carts.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> meal <b>cart</b> {{users in}} <b>the</b> various {{hospital}} visited {{were asked to}} attend to the questionnaire which serves as the tool for the ergonomic evaluation aiming at detecting whether the users experience any discomfort in using <b>the</b> meal <b>carts</b> {{as a result of the}} design of <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> and <b>the</b> overall description of rating of the work. The layout pathway of <b>the</b> meal <b>carts</b> needs a minimum space of 75.0  cm when moving forth or back and a minimum of 102.5  cm for turning <b>the</b> meal <b>cart</b> especially when in motion, while <b>the</b> meal <b>carts</b> are been pushed or pulled on smooth floor surfaces.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> River <b>Cart</b> {{itself is}} very short, being formed from the {{confluence}} of <b>the</b> Black <b>Cart</b> Water (from <b>the</b> west) and <b>the</b> White <b>Cart</b> Water (from <b>the</b> south east) and is only 0.75 mile (1 km) long. <b>The</b> River <b>Cart</b> and its tributary <b>the</b> White <b>Cart</b> Water were navigable {{as far as the}} Seedhill Craigs at Paisley; and, as with the River Clyde, various improvements were made to this river navigation.|$|R
5|$|Iron Maiden {{were formed}} on Christmas Day in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris {{shortly after he}} left his {{previous}} group, Smiler. Harris attributes the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which {{reminded him of the}} iron maiden torture device. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E
5|$|Prost went on {{a sabbatical}} year in 1992, which was {{dominated}} by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team. After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> series. The Frenchman had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year. Prost {{was part of a}} new-look driver line-up at Williams, with test driver Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.|$|E
50|$|The {{craft of}} making <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> is {{handed down from}} {{generation}} to generation, through the training of apprentices. Carts are known for being covered in carvings and brightly painted scenes from Sicilian history and folklore as well as intricate geometrical designs. These scenes also served the purpose of conveying historical information {{to those who were}} illiterate. The colors of Sicily's flag, yellow and red, feature prominently on <b>the</b> <b>carts,</b> along with details in bright blues and greens. The animals pulling <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> are often elaborately adorned as well.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{original}} Cuttle <b>Cart,</b> Schell released <b>the</b> Cuttle <b>Cart</b> 2 for <b>the</b> Atari 7800, and <b>the</b> Cuttle <b>Cart</b> 3 for <b>the</b> Intellivision console.|$|R
30|$|In {{workstation}} 4 (baking), <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> {{are automatically}} pushed from the proofing cell to the oven.

5|$|The final lap of {{the trail}} to Saint Paul, which had {{replaced}} Mendota as the principal entrepôt for <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> trade, continued along the sandplain on the east bank of the Mississippi. This route ran within {{a few miles of}} the river to Saint Anthony Falls and the community of that name which was growing on the east bank of the Mississippi. The trail then left the river and crossed open country to Saint Paul. The carters camped on the uplands west of the steamboat landing during the interval between their arrival with the furs and their return to the north with supplies and trade goods.|$|E
5|$|Nellie Kehoe was {{discharged}} from Lansing's St. Lawrence Hospital on May 16, {{and her husband}} murdered her some time between her release and the bombings two days later. He put her body in a wheelbarrow located {{in the rear of}} the farm's chicken coop, where it was found in a heavily charred condition after the farm explosions and fire. Piled around <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> were silverware and a metal cash box. Ashes of several bank notes could be seen through a slit in the cash box. Kehoe had placed and wired homemade pyrotol firebombs in the house and all the buildings of the farm. The burned remains of his two horses were found tied in their enclosures with their legs wired together to prevent their rescue during the fire.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
60|$|Four men in {{each company}} were then told off {{to pack the}} baggage in <b>the</b> <b>carts.</b> Lisle {{was one of those}} {{furnished}} by his company. There was little talk while they were at work. In two hours <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> were packed. Then, as they returned to the lines, his three comrades entered into conversation with him.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>the</b> Black <b>Cart</b> Water and <b>the</b> White <b>Cart</b> Water {{provided}} {{power to}} drive mills. The best preserved on <b>the</b> White <b>Cart</b> is Dripps Mill in Waterfoot, which still has two functioning 19th century waterwheels.|$|R

5|$|The final part of {{the supply}} chain for {{domestic}} and smaller commercial customers involved the delivery of ice, typically using an ice wagon. In the U.S., ice was cut into 25-, 50- and 100-pound blocks (11, 23 and 45kg) then distributed by horse-drawn ice wagons. An iceman, driving <b>the</b> <b>cart,</b> would then deliver the ice to the household, using ice tongs to hold the cubes. Deliveries could occur either daily or twice daily. By the 1870s, various specialist distributors existed in the major cities, with local fuel dealers or other businesses selling and delivering ice in the smaller communities. In Britain, ice was rarely sold to domestic customers via specialist dealers during the 19th century, instead usually being sold through fishmongers, butchers and chemists, who kept ice on their premises for their own commercial use.|$|E
5|$|The {{person was}} first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis ("blood-colored rods", probably), {{and his head}} was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientist}} Tolley {{aimed to}} establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its trolley, and that a man can exert a force of 300N {{over an extended period}} of time, the pulling teams—depending on the slope and the surface of <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> track—must have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined exertion of force of 33 to 42kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing the trolley up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2km per hour over an estimated length of 6kilometres, the transfer from sea to sea would have taken three hours to complete.|$|E
40|$|Includes Photographs, Maps and Bibliography. Our {{research}} investigates <b>the</b> food <b>cart</b> {{scene on}} Madison's Isthmus. City policies and regulations focus {{the density of}} food carts on Library Mall on the UW-Madison campus; however we emphasize in our narrative the social and spatial interactions that factor into the area's importance as a hub. Multiple interviews demonstrate that food cart location and design reflect the interactions of economics, policy, and producer-consumer dynamics {{as well as the}} constraints of physical geography. Ethnographic and landscape observations document the many social and spatial relationships tied to mobile food. These relationships include the close producer-consumer rapport encouraged by <b>the</b> <b>carts,</b> <b>the</b> social interaction fostered by the vibrant atmosphere, and the communal identities surrounding food, connected to <b>the</b> environment <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> create. <b>The</b> <b>carts</b> expand a culinary niche by bridging community and city involvement, and finally, encouraging food mobility, convenience, quality, and uniqueness...|$|R
25|$|A {{shopping}} cart is a metal or plastic basket on wheels supplied by a shop, especially a supermarket, {{for use by}} customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the check-out counter during shopping. Often, customers are allowed to leave <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> in <b>the</b> parking lot, and store personnel return <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> to <b>the</b> shop. <b>The</b> first shopping <b>cart</b> was invented by Sylvan Goldman in 1937, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma City.|$|R

5|$|William Bury {{was born}} in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, the {{youngest}} of four children of Henry Bury and his wife Mary Jane (née Henley). He was orphaned in infancy. His father, who worked for a local fishmonger called Joscelyne, died in a horse and cart accident in Halesowen on 10 April 1860. While on an incline, he fell beneath the wheels of his fish cart and was killed when the horse bolted and pulled <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> over his prone body. William's mother may have been suffering from post-natal depression {{at the time of}} her husband's death and was committed to the Worcester County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum on 7 May 1860 suffering from melancholia. She remained there until her death aged 33 on 30 March 1864.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{had led to}} an {{economic}} collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus {{to the east and}} war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.|$|E
25|$|The Indianapolis 500 itself, however, {{remained}} {{under the}} sanctioning control of USAC. It became the lone top-level race the body still sanctioned, as it ultimately dropped all other Indy car races (as {{well as their}} stock car division) to concentrate on sprints and midgets. For the next three years, the race was not officially recognized on <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> calendar, but <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> teams and drivers comprised the field. By 1983, an agreement was made for the USAC-sanctioned Indy 500 to be recognized on <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> calendar, and the race awarded points towards <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> championship.|$|E
