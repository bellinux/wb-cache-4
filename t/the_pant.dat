5|$|As the {{deadline}} stipulated in Part XVII of the Constitution for switching to Hindi as primary official language approached, {{the central government}} stepped up its efforts to spread Hindi's official usage. In 1960, compulsory training for Hindi typing and stenography was started. The same year, India's president Rajendra Prasad acted on <b>the</b> <b>Pant</b> Committee's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of Hindi glossaries, translating procedural literature and legal codes to Hindi, imparting Hindi education to government employees and other efforts for propagating Hindi.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Artillery uniforms were a variety of {{handmade}} and personally customized uniforms. By 1862, the Confederate uniforms became organized. They became cadet gray and were to be lined {{with a layer of}} red around the sleeve. <b>The</b> <b>pant</b> legs were light blue. Even after the uniforms were organized many of the artillerymen wore regular clothes due to the heat and discomfort caused by the regular uniforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Cavalry uniforms {{were made by the}} cavalrymen themselves. By 1862, the Confederate {{regulations}} ordered the uniform to become organized, being cadet gray and lined with a thin layer around the sleeve. <b>The</b> <b>pant</b> legs were light blue with a yellow strip rising {{from the bottom of the}} leg to the top. Non-commissioned officers of the cavalry wore either regular clothes from home or a variety of different types of uniforms. yellow was the prescribed branch of service color, but surviving uniforms show beyond a doubt that the vast majority of cavalrymen who used any branch of service color, used buff as yellow cloth was virtually non existent in the Confederacy.|$|E

30|$|This was {{the result}} of there not being any {{increase}} in ease on the circumference area for <b>the</b> <b>pants.</b> Most menswear brands developed <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> lining patterns by increasing the circumference about 0.5  cm at each end of pattern. There were several brands, however, which reduced <b>the</b> <b>pant’s</b> overall ease when <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> design had pleats, because pleat design had the ease built into it already. These brands reduced the pleat amount or converted the two pleats into one pleat when developing the lining pattern.|$|R
30|$|Results of {{this survey}} showed that <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> lining {{patterns}} were {{not the same as}} the outer shell pattern size. In addition, specific shifting degrees on <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> lining patterns were not simple, whether it is <b>the</b> suit <b>pants</b> or casual <b>pants.</b> Especially, for <b>the</b> casual <b>pants,</b> <b>the</b> length of back lining fit into two categories either knee length or crotch length. Manufacturers of men’s pants should consider these specific results to save time and cost when manufacturing both styles of pants.|$|R
5|$|The {{prominence}} of a Brahmin in Indian society was {{directly related to}} his virtues, values, knowledge and practice of the scriptures. Manu's list of virtues of a perfect Brahmin, according to Italian Jesuit Roberto de Nobili, in order of importance were righteousness, truthfulness, generosity, almsgiving, compassion, self-restraint and diligent work. Prior {{to the rise of}} the Konkanastha Peshwas, the Konkanastha Brahmins were considered inferior in a society where the Deshasthas held socio-economic, ritual and Brahminical superiority. As mentioned earlier, all <b>the</b> <b>Pant</b> Pradhan during Shivaji's rule were Deshastha Brahmins and many modern families who have surname, Peshwe, are in fact Deshastha Brahmins tracing descent to Shivaji's Pant Pradhans, Moropant Pingle or Sonopant Dabir. After the appointment of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa, Konkanastha migrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune, where the Peshwa offered some important offices to the Konkanastha caste. The Konkanastha kin were rewarded with tax relief and grants of land. Historians point out nepotism and corruption during this time.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} series, divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes {{were moved to}} small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used for special occasions, Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were double-stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. Jumpsuits, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight spandex that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, leisure wear, and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.|$|E
25|$|Trousers {{underwent}} a notable {{change in the}} 1820s. The new fit {{was a product of}} the French Revolution as it was considered uncouth to wear attire that looked wealthy. The length of <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> changed from below the knee to below the ankle and the fit of <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> loosened slightly from {{the first decade of the}} 19th century. The pants featured a small waistline and flared out slightly at the hip with small pleats, creating the image of fullness in the hip region. The introduction of straps that went under the foot, known as stirrup pants, also changed the shape and fit of these trousers.|$|E

Under the eye of the leader, the Dotties are initially prosperous, forming a civilization with the pyramid and statue.

25|$|The 1975 season saw the {{introduction}} of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. The uniforms had multishade stripes of orange, red and yellow in front and in back behind a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same stripes ran down <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> legs. Players numbers not only appeared {{on the back of the}} jersey, but also on <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.|$|E
500|$|As {{provided}} for by Article 343, Nehru appointed the First Official Language Commission under {{the chairmanship of}} B. G. Kher on 7 June 1955. The commission delivered its report on 31 July 1956. It recommended a number of steps to eventually replace English with Hindi (the report registered [...] "dissenting notes" [...] from two members – P. Subbarayan from Madras State and Suniti Kumar Chatterji from West Bengal). The Parliamentary Committee on Official Language, chaired by Govind Ballabh Pant was constituted in September 1957 to review the Kher commission report. After two years of deliberations, <b>the</b> <b>Pant</b> Committee submitted its recommendations to the President on 8 February 1959. It recommended that Hindi should be made the primary official language with English as the subsidiary one. The Kher Commission and <b>the</b> <b>Pant</b> Committee recommendations were condemned and opposed by self-described [...] "non-Hindi" [...] politicians like Frank Anthony and P. Subbarayan. The Academy of Telugu opposed the switch from English to Hindi in a convention held in 1956. Rajaji, once a staunch supporter of Hindi, organised an All India Language Conference (attended by representatives of Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, Kannada and Bengali languages) on 8 March 1958 to oppose the switch, declaring [...] "Hindi is as much foreign to non-Hindi speaking people as English is to the protagonists of Hindi." ...|$|E

30|$|There were {{interesting}} {{differences between}} <b>the</b> suit <b>pants</b> and <b>the</b> casual <b>pants</b> in seam allowances {{from the back}} crotch curve to the waistline. <b>The</b> suit <b>pants</b> pattern had different seam allowances throughout the garment (100 %, 13 out of 13), while <b>the</b> casual <b>pants</b> pattern used <b>the</b> same amount throughout (53.8 %, 7 out of 13). There could be several reasons for the differences: the price of suit pants is higher than <b>the</b> casual <b>pants,</b> so consumers would want to wear <b>the</b> suit <b>pants</b> {{for a longer period}} of time. In this case, individual alterations to <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> can take place as needed, since one’s body shape, especially the waist circumference, changes with age. The seam allowance for suit <b>pants</b> near <b>the</b> hip line, 1 – 1.3  cm, was increased to 2.5 – 3.0  cm on the waistline to prepare for the individual alteration. In contrast, <b>the</b> casual <b>pants</b> used <b>the</b> same 1 – 1.3  cm seam allowances on all areas of the garment, because alterations are not as common for casual <b>pants.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> waistband shape on the center back line was different between <b>the</b> two <b>pant</b> types. <b>The</b> suit <b>pants</b> potentially need to be altered, while casual <b>pants</b> do not. <b>The</b> suit <b>pants</b> had a seam on the center back of the waistband and <b>the</b> casual <b>pants</b> had seamless center back line.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>pants</b> {{now come}} in a large range of colours and styles due to their {{commercialisation}} when traditionally only made in blue or black.

30|$|For pants {{manufacturing}} {{according to}} <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> style (suit pants, casual pants), most menswear brands used the pattern with included seam allowances regardless of pants styles (suit pants, 84.6 %; casual pants, 61.5 %). Ease on the lining patterns {{from the outer}} shell patterns (according to <b>the</b> typical <b>pants</b> designs such as no-pleat, one-pleat, two-pleats <b>pants)</b> were <b>the</b> same regardless of <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> style (suit pants, 92.3 %; casual pants, 84.6 %).|$|R
2500|$|On April 14 at a {{ceremony}} at the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland, the team unveiled their new uniforms. They feature brown, white, and orange jerseys along with brown, white, and orange pants that can be worn in any combination. Unique features include the word [...] "Cleveland" [...] {{across the front of}} the jersey, the word [...] "Browns" [...] going down <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> leg, and the words [...] "Dawg Pound" [...] on the inside collar - all first of their kind features on NFL uniforms. Browns President Alec Scheiner compared these new jerseys to those of the Oregon Ducks football team, as the Ducks are known for their various uniform combinations.|$|E

2500|$|Parachute {{pants are}} {{a style of}} {{trousers}} characterized {{by the use of}} ripstop nylon or extremely baggy cuts. In the original tight-fitting, extraneously zippered style of the late 1970s and early 1980s, [...] "parachute" [...] referred to the pants' synthetic nylon material. In the later 1980s, [...] "parachute" [...] may have referred to the extreme bagginess of <b>the</b> <b>pant.</b> These are also referred to as [...] "Hammer" [...] pants, due to rapper MC Hammer's signature style. Hammer pants differ from the parachute pants of the 1970s and early 1980s. They are typically worn as menswear and are often brightly colored. [...] Parachute pants became a fad in US culture in the 1980s as part of an increased cultural appropriation of breakdancing.|$|E

2500|$|Giants' jerseys are {{traditionally}} blue or red (or white with blue or red accents), and their pants alternate between white and gray. Currently, the Giants wear home jerseys that are solid blue with white block numbering, white pants with five thin blue/gray/red/gray/blue stripes on <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> legs, and solid blue socks. For this they gained their most renowned nickname, [...] "Big Blue". For road uniforms, they wear a white jersey with red block numbering and red [...] "Northwestern" [...] stripes on the sleeves, gray pants with three thin non-contiguous red/blue/red stripes on <b>the</b> <b>pant</b> legs, and solid red socks. The Giants' current helmet is metallic blue with white block numbers, which are frontally mounted and base mounted {{on either side}} of a red stripe running down the center or frontally mounted and base mounted on the red center stripe itself. The Giants, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The helmet is adorned on both sides with the stylized white lower case [...] "ny" [...] logo and features a gray facemask. The home uniforms are generally similar to the design used from 1966 to 1974, but with some slight elements from the 1956–1961 uniforms. The road uniforms are essentially a modernization of the design used from 1956 to 1961. Additionally, the Giants had a third jersey until the 2009 season, which recalled the Giants' solid red home jerseys from the early 1950s: a solid red alternate with white block numbers. These jerseys were used a total of four times, but have since been retired. They were used once in 2004 against the Philadelphia Eagles and in three consecutive years – 2005, 2006, and 2007 – against the Dallas Cowboys.|$|E
