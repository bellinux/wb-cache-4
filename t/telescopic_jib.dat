25|$|Based on {{the latest}} {{production}} Fahd-240, it shares the position and entry doors for the commander and the driver with the APC variant. A 2.5 ton turnable-mounted hydraulic crane is mounted on the roof rear, with a <b>telescopic</b> <b>jib</b> that has 315 degrees of traverse, with the boom being elevated to +70 degrees. The vehicle contains two hydraulic stabilizers for the crane, {{in which they are}} lowered to the ground while the crane is being used to provide a more stable platform. The vehicle is 13 tons in weight, and 2.8 meters in height.|$|E
50|$|A {{telescopic}} {{tower crane}} has a telescopic mast {{and often a}} superstructure (jib) on top so that it functions as a tower crane. Some telescopic tower cranes also have a <b>telescopic</b> <b>jib.</b>|$|E
5000|$|WZT is {{the acronym}} of for Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego {{literally}} Technical Support Vehicle: it indicates {{a family of}} armoured recovery vehicles based on the PT-91/T-72 tank hull, with over 400 vehicles delivered to the clients. It is armed with a 12.7 mm ( [...] in) machine-gun fitted to the commander’s hatch. Standard equipment includes: crane with <b>telescopic</b> <b>jib</b> that can lift a maximum load of fifteen tonnes, front-mounted stabilizing dozer blade, main and secondary winches.|$|E
50|$|Production {{of diesel}} {{locomotives}} started in 1948. From the early 1960s the product range diversified into rolling stock (rail and tram) components. In 1977, the production profile expanded into construction equipment and its name was changed into Fabryka Maszyn Budowlanych i Lokomotyw BUMAR-FABLOK (Factory of Building Machinery and Locomotives BUMAR-FABLOK). The factory {{was taken over}} by Zjednoczenie Przemyslu Maszyn Budowlanych BUMAR (BUMAR Association of Building Machinery Industry) in Warsaw. Production included excavators with bucket capacity of 1.2 cubic metre, cranes with 25-28 ton lifting capacity, self-propelled road cranes, and hydraulic <b>telescopic</b> <b>jibs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Major crane {{development}} events include {{adoption of}} {{the internal combustion engine}} in 1922 and the invention of <b>telescopic</b> <b>jibs.</b> Before 1960, cranes carried additional booms with them to increase height, which increased operating costs. In 1959 crane expert R.H.Neal, hydraulics specialist F.Taylor, and design director Bob Lester integrated all three and modernized cranes. The Coles Hydra Speedcrane appeared in 1962, further modified with the 10-ton fully telescopic hydraulic boom in 1966, followed in 1968 by the 30-ton [...] "Husky" [...] military versions with four-wheel drive. In 1972, Steels was forced to merge with the Acrow Group, losing some of their most valuable employees, including Don Hassel and Johnny Johnson who started a new manufacturing processes plant. With backing from the British Crane Hire Corporation they acquired a small factory unit and ordered every single element of their product from subcontracted suppliers. In 1976, the Cosmos team created a 25-ton crane that combined several state-of-the-art developments.|$|R

5000|$|A {{tower crane}} is usually {{assembled}} by a <b>telescopic</b> <b>jib</b> (mobile) crane of greater reach (also see [...] "self-erecting crane" [...] below) {{and in the}} case of tower cranes that have risen while constructing very tall skyscrapers, a smaller crane (or derrick) will often be lifted to the roof of the completed tower to dismantle the tower crane afterwards, which may be more difficult than the installation.Tower Cranes can often be Pedestrian Operated by a remote control, removing the need for a cab for the Crane Operator to work from.|$|E

40|$|According {{to greater}} {{distortion}} of local stress calculated in the slider joint for solid-webbed <b>telescopic</b> <b>jib</b> caused by previous simplified way, this paper puts forward to 3 × 2 {{kinds of different}} treatment ways: three kinds of ways dealing with fixed junction surfaces namely the coplanar way, MPC Algorithm and node coupling, two kinds of ways dealing with the corresponding sliding contact surfaces such as linear node coupling and contact nonlinear analysis. Regard the structure of solid-webbed <b>telescopic</b> <b>jib</b> with elliptical cross section as research object; analyze its feasibility and rationality of six kinds of treatment ways comparatively combining results by means of FEA software ANSYS and strength calculation theory in the overlapping and non-overlapping zones on simplification basis of the actual conditions of jib. It is found that the model’s FEA results with the coplanar way in the fixed junction surfaces occur serious distortion phenomenon through the whole analysis and comparison, which the degree of distortion reaches 354. 5 %, indicating that this treatment way has failed; The FEA results of model which sliding contact surfaces are disposed of contact nonlinear analysis are greater than the results of model which sliding contact surfaces are disposed of linear node coupling, there is no stress concentration phenomenon {{in this kind of}} treatment way, the simulation results are safer than before, and it is more consistent with the actual contact condition. Due to the contact analysis is a kind of nonlinear analysis behaviour which needs more computer resource. Therefore, the actual calculation results can be obtained more actually and economically if the node coupling is adapted to the slider joint while computer resource is nervous...|$|E
40|$|This master's thesis makes a brief {{comparison}} of design variants of cranes for general {{use on the}} deck of a vessel. Further, this thesis deals with a design of a crane with a <b>telescopic</b> <b>jib</b> and a single knuckle. An important part of the crane’s design is its kinematic solution, which was modified in the design phase. The last step of a simplified analytical calculation of the jib for design steel construction is given. This preliminary calculation is the starting point for a FEM model and for the following FEM analysis. A stress control is made according to the Lloyd's Register of Shipping agency’s standard for lifting appliances in marine environment and also according to the recommendations of Huisman company. A part of the proposed solution is a selection of main components of the crane. The master’s thesis contains a summary of some operational and other information which characterize possibilities of the crane’s use. This thesis also includes source materials for drawing documentation...|$|E
