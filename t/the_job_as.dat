5|$|A Master of Business Administration (MBA) {{program was}} added in 1961, {{and the school}} formed its National Advisory Council in 1966.

Orton served as interim {{dean of the school}} for a year until 1975, when Merrill J. Bateman was recruited from a management position at candy-maker Mars, Inc. for <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> dean. That same year, the school was separated into the School of Management for undergraduate studies and the Graduate School of Management, which grouped together the MBA, MPA, MOB, and MAcc programs. A year later (1976), the business school created a School of Accountancy within its jurisdiction and printed its first issue of Exchange magazine (now Marriott Alumni Magazine). In 1977, the BYU Management Society was organized.|$|E

5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E
5|$|Ashworth left Liverpool {{midway through}} the {{following}} season, to manage Oldham Athletic – he wished {{to be closer to}} his wife and daughter, who lived in nearby Stockport. His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen, a club director. McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment, but he kept <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> Liverpool retained the League championship. This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott, who conceded only 31 goals during the season, a league record at the time. Liverpool's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier. Harry Chambers top scored in the first four post World War 1 seasons including the two title wins.|$|E

Shortly after the departure of his immediate superior, he was promoted to lieutenant commander, a post which he occupied for two years.

5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s, Khoo tried {{to pursue a}} Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from various universities, {{but all of them}} {{rejected}} his application as he did not possess a first degree for admission. Khoo only had two professional diplomas – a Diploma in Administrative Management and a Certified Diploma in Accounting and Finance from ACCA. He finally received an unconditional offer from the University of Stirling after he impressed the visiting Director of the MBA programme showing how he managed the award-winning shopping mall. In 1989, accompanied by his wife, he left Malaysia to pursue his MBA studies in Scotland and graduated with Distinction in 1991. Instead of returning to Malaysia, he went to Singapore again to seek better opportunities there and was offered <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> Director of Operations for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be}} interviewed for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the bridge}} {{would be the}} only road from the {{mainland}} to the archipelago, tolls could be collected in only one direction. The tolls were set to NOK40 for semitrailers, NOK30 for buses, NOK20 for trucks, NOK12 for cars, NOK5 for motorcycles, NOK4 for bicycles, NOK2 for adults and 1 for children. Discounts were available at the same rates as for ferries. The four people who had worked the longest on the ferry were offered <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> toll plaza employees.

The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would stay at a hotel. Cabin crew had no training, and learned <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> they worked.

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica {{was what the}} film's producers were looking for. Initially ignorant of the Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> composer to get better context for his music. This and discussions he had with staff helped {{in the creation of}} eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and when he could he incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} law authorizing the {{construction}} of a highway connecting Route24 (an unsigned legislative route that is now part of NY30) to the new Veterans' Mountain Camp, an American Legion camp on Tupper Lake. The work was funded through appropriations defined in the law. The beginning of a state road to the camp came in 1924 when earth movers were brought in by the Harnathy Contracting Company, with construction beginning in early June. The project would include construction of a concrete bridge over the Bog River. However, Hanrathy was unable to finish <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> it went bankrupt, and a second firm, the Spadaccini Realty Construction Corporation of The Bronx was brought into finish the job, which began in June1925.The bridge over the Bog River was completed on August 29, 1925 and they announced would be opened for traffic within ten days.The route did finally open in 1925, with the Veterans Camp opening on May 15, 1926. This road was extended from modern NY30 north to a dead end at Warren Point. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not yet have a designation were assigned one. The Veterans' Mountain Camp highway was designated as NY421 by the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakout}} {{began as}} soon as the weather allowed the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing to provide air cover on 1 December. As the soldiers formed a convoy and tried to leave the perimeter, the PVA 241st Regiment immediately swarmed over the American forces, with three other regiments closing in. Left with no choice, the covering aircraft dropped napalm right in front of RCT-31, causing casualties among both Chinese and US troops. The resulting firestorm wiped out the blocking Chinese company, allowing the convoy to advance. As the front of RCT-31 made their way forward, heavy small arms fire caused many members of the rear guard to seek shelter below the road instead of protecting the trucks. Chinese fire also killed or wounded those already in the trucks as well as the drivers, who viewed <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> a form of suicide. Slowly, the convoy approached a roadblock under Hill 1221 in the late afternoon. Several parties tried to clear Hill 1221, but after taking part of the hill, the leaderless soldiers continued out onto the frozen reservoir instead of returning to the column. As Faith led an assault on the roadblock, he was hit by a Chinese grenade and subsequently died of his wounds. The convoy managed to fight past the first road block, but as it reached the second at Hudong-ni, RCT-31 disintegrated under Chinese attacks. About 1,050 soldiers out of the original 2,500 managed to reach Hagaru-ri, and only 385 survivors were deemed able-bodied. The remnants of RCT-31 were formed into a provisional army battalion {{for the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
