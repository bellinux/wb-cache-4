In 1970, only 31% of homes had <b>central</b> <b>heating.</b> By 2003 it had been installed in 92% of British homes, leading in turn to {{a rise in the}} average temperature within them (from 12.1°C to 18.20°C).

50|$|The ancient Greeks {{originally}} developed <b>central</b> <b>heating.</b> The temple of Ephesus was heated by flues {{planted in the}} ground and circulating the heat which was generated by fire.

50|$|When a solar water <b>heating</b> and hot-water <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> {{system are}} used together, solar heat will either be {{concentrated}} in a pre-heating tank that feeds {{into the tank}} <b>heated</b> by the <b>central</b> <b>heating,</b> or the solar heat exchanger will replace the lower heating element and the upper element will remain to provide for supplemental heat. However, the primary need for <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> is at night and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> because supply and demand are better matched. In many climates, a solar hot water system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. This can include domestic non-electric concentrating solar thermal systems. In many northern European countries, combined hot water and space heating systems (solar combisystems) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy. When combined with storage, large scale solar heating can provide 50-97% of annual heat consumption for district heating.|$|R
