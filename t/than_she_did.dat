25|$|Despite {{its heavy}} promotion, Diana's next album, Workin' Overtime, was a {{critical}} and commercial failure. Subsequent follow-ups such as The Force Behind the Power (1991), Take Me Higher (1995), and Every Day Is a New Day (1999) produced similarly disappointing sales. Ross had more success overseas with the albums <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in America.|$|E

25|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Goodrem will embark on a national tour of Australia aptly entitled the Believe Again Tour in smaller venues <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> on her Visualise Tour. Goodrem felt that the songs on her new album lent themselves to a smaller, more intimate setting. She announced 9 dates in 7 different cities, but has since announced more shows due to a high volume of ticket sales. To date she will perform 14 shows in 8 cities. Goodrem was quoted as saying what viewers saw at the AFI Awards, regarding her remixed song and dance performance of Believe Again, in 2007, is only a taste of what is to be expected from her new tour.|$|E
25|$|The success led Irving Thalberg, head of {{production}} at MGM, to cast {{her in a}} similar role in The Temptress (1926), based on another Ibáñez novel. After only one film, she was given top billing, playing opposite Antonio Moreno. Her mentor Stiller, who had persuaded her to take the part, was assigned to direct. For both Garbo (who {{did not want to}} play another vamp and did not like the script any more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> the first one) and Stiller, The Temptress was a harrowing experience. Stiller, who spoke little English, had difficulty adapting to the studio system and did not get on with Moreno, was fired by Thalberg and replaced by Fred Niblo. Reshooting The Temptress was expensive and even though it became one of the top-grossing films of the 1926–27 season, it was the only Garbo film of the period to lose money. However, Garbo received rave reviews and MGM had a new star.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{have responded}} to the influx of non-white {{immigrants}} by making more explicit efforts to court the Hispanic and Asian vote. In 2004, George W. Bush captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000, despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide compared with the 2000 election. Although Barbara Boxer won statewide, and fared better in Orange County <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in 1998, Republican Bill Jones defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that John Kerry received is higher than the percentage Bill Clinton won in both 1992 and 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (59.7% of the vote) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator Dianne Feinstein won 45% of the vote in the county, the highest margin of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only Coastal California county to vote for her Republican opponent Dick Mountjoy. In terms of voter registration, the Democratic Party has a plurality or majority of registrations only in the cities of Buena Park, Laguna Beach, Santa Ana and Stanton.|$|E

25|$|From {{that time}} she was an indefatigable reader, troubling her parents only by her devotion to books {{rather than to the}} play natural to her age. Her father had a {{considerable}} library, the contents of every book in which she made her own, always preferring history, — before she had finished her 10th year being acquainted with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and kindred writers. At this point, she was sent away to school. Her father and mother, seeing the intellect for which they were responsible, took all possible pains with her education, and fortunately her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. She cared more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no especial pleasure in mathematics. Booth's superior education was not given her at school, where she learned less <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> by herself, for she showed very young that disdain of obstacles and that taste for literature which were two strong points in her character. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French. A stray French primer fell into her hands, and she became interested in spelling out the French words and comparing them with the English ones, and continued to study in this way. Later she acquired German in the same manner, and being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she never learned to speak them, but made herself so proficient in them in after years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French at sight, reading them aloud in English.|$|E

[...] Defending his own behaviour in not sending his full fleet to North America, he also wrote that [...] "f the admiral in America had met Sir Samuel Hood near the Chesapeake", that Cornwallis's surrender might have been prevented.|$|E
500|$|With her spiky {{hair and}} bright clothing, Daphne {{stood out from}} other female {{characters}} on television at the time. She was portrayed as a strong, smart and independent woman. She was often shrewd and [...] "a warm friend" [...] to those around her. Tony Johnston, author of Neighbours: 20 years of Ramsay Street stated that Daphne had [...] "an appealing mix of cheek, savvy and the-girl-next-door." [...] She was a woman in charge of her own life, which helped her to become the serial's first [...] "sweetheart." [...] Smith told Kingsley that her favourite aspects of Daphne's personality were her confidence and stubborn streak. Smith also commented that Daphne wore [...] "zanier clothes" [...] <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> and was more outgoing.

500|$|The album {{experimented with}} a diverse number of genres, {{including}} contemporary R, deep house, swing jazz, hip hop, rock, and pop, with Billboard describing each as being [...] "delivered with consummate skill and passion." [...] Jackson took {{a larger role}} in songwriting and production <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> on her previous albums, explaining she found it necessary [...] "to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies" [...] while also speaking candidly about incorporating her sexuality into the album's content. Rolling Stone wrote [...] "s princess of America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself in charge of her life, as she did on Control (1986), or commander in chief of a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems (Rhythm Nation 1814, from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet., it's a cultural moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Cruz's {{first film}} of 2016 was the American comedy Zoolander 2, co-starring and {{directed}} by Ben Stiller. In the sequel film, Cruz portrayed a secret Interpol agent who enlists models Derek Zoolander (Stiller) and Hansel McDonald, played by Owen Wilson, to help find out who is killing the world’s most beautiful people. Specifically written for her persona, Cruz, {{a fan of the}} original 2001 film, {{was one of the first}} actors to be cast in their parts. Upon its release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that it had [...] "more celebrity cameos than laughs." [...] Cruz's other film that year was Louis Leterrier's British spy comedy Grimsby, in which she played a powerful philanthropist, opposite Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong. Cruz was reportedly offered $400,000 for her appearance in the film, which was released to generally mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the actress was highly underused and [...] "looking even less invested here <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in Zoolander 2." ...|$|E

He found it [...] "complicated" [...] to persuade McAdams to return in a smaller role: [...] "She loved being with us, but she hoped to have a bigger role." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt [...] "she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise." [...] Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post remarked that she [...] "exhibits far more personality and roguish charm in her few moments here <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in all of the previous film. Freed from the constraints of being the de-facto love interest, McAdams relishes the chance to go full-villain." [...] The film has grossed over $543million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|The writers {{had written}} {{a scene in which}} Willa Ford's {{character}} Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore. Eventually, the girl would tire and drown. Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films, but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral. A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna. Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in {{the final version of the}} film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a [...] "cute line" [...] about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death. The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in previous installments of the series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark (Tom McBride) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of Friday the 13th.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} at Flyte Tyme studios in Edina, Minnesota. Songs on the album, {{with the exception}} of [...] "What'll I Do", were written by Janet Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and mixed by Steve Hodge and Dave Rideau; [...] "What'll I Do" [...] was written and produced by Jackson and Jellybean Johnson. Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> on her previous albums. She explained that [...] "ll my records are personal, and janet, is the most personal of them all. That's why this time around it was important for me to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies." [...] Jam described the record as being [...] "a more mature album musically." [...] David Ritz noted that Jackson and her producers took risks by experimenting with musical influences that had not appeared in their previous work. He explained: [...] "She asked Kathleen Battle and Public Enemy's Chuck D to contribute—an opera diva and a hardcore rapper, two artists one would not associate with Janet—and somehow pulled if off. Beyond Jam and Lewis, there's now a recognizable Janet Jackson production style that's gutsy and, in some cases, even eccentric." ...|$|E
500|$|Danielle {{was killed}} off minutes after {{revealing}} her true identity to Ronnie, dying in her mother's arms. Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered, Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie's status as EastEnders [...] "tragic heroine character". Treadwell-Collins felt that to allow Ronnie {{to have her}} daughter, the [...] "one thing that is key to her character" [...] would serve to progressively weaken her character, and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching, ultimately the relationship would become boring. The scene in which Danielle dies was filmed during winter, but as it was set in early April, snow had to be cleared away from the set before filming could commence. A body double {{was used for the}} moment Danielle was run over. Although sad to leave, Crace felt that the story's conclusion was the right one, and was glad that Ronnie and Danielle finally shared a brief moment in the end, explaining: [...] "It was so important that that tender moment was finally found, because that's all people wanted. It's all Danielle wanted, and it's all Ronnie wants." [...] Crace concluded: [...] "I think Danielle will leave quite a big mark on the Square and on the people in the Square – probably a bigger mark <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> when she was alive.|$|E
