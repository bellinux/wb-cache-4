40|$|A design {{philosophy}} for low Reynolds number airfoils that judiciously {{combines the}} tailoring of the airfoil pressure distribution using a <b>transition</b> <b>ramp</b> {{with the use}} of boundary-layer trips is presented. Three airfoils with systematic changes to the shape of the <b>transition</b> <b>ramp</b> have been designed to study the effect of trips on the airfoil performance. The airfoils were wind-tunnel tested with various trip locations and at Reynolds numbers of 100, 000 and 300, 000 to assess the effectiveness of the design philosophy. The results show that the design philosophy was successfully used in integratinga boundary-layertrip from the outset in the airfoil designprocess. For theReynolds numbers and the range of airfoil shapes considered, however, airfoils designed with trips do not hold any clear advantage over airfoils designed for good performance in the clean condition.

40|$|Anisotropic {{diffusion}} affords an efficient, adaptive signal smoothing {{technique that}} can be used for signal enhancement, signal segmentation, and signal scale-space creation. This paper introduces a novel partial differential equation (PDE) -based diffusion method for generating locally monotonic signals. Unlike previous diffusion techniques that diverge or converge to trivial signals, locally monotonic (LOMO) diffusion converges rapidly to welldefined LOMO signals of the desired degree. The property of local monotonicity allows both slow and rapid signal <b>transitions</b> (<b>ramp</b> and step edges) while excluding outliers due to noise. In contrast with other diffusion methods, LOMO diffusion does not require an additional regularization step to process a noisy signal and uses no ad hoc thresholds or parameters. In the paper, we develop the LOMO diffusion technique and provide several salient properties, including stability and a characterization of the root signals. The convergence of the algorithm is well behaved (nonoscillatory) and is independent of signal length, in contrast with the median filter. A special case of LOMO diffusion is identical to the optimal solution achieved via regression. Experimental results validate the claim that LOMO diffusion can produce denoised LOMO signals with low error using less computation than the median-order statistic approach...|$|R

The route continues through the San Fernando Valley and then crosses the Newhall Pass through the Santa Susana Mountains into the Santa Clarita Valley.

40|$|The {{physics of}} collisionless shocks {{is a very}} broad topic which has been studied {{for more than five}} decades. However, {{there are a number of}} {{important}} issues which remain unresolved. The energy repartition amongst particle populations in quasiperpendicular shocks is a multi-scale process related to the spatial and temporal structure of the electromagnetic fields within the shock layer. The most important processes take place in the close vicinity of the major magnetic <b>transition</b> or <b>ramp</b> region. The distribution of electromagnetic fields in this region determines the characteristics of ion reflection and thus defines the conditions for ion heating and energy dissipation for supercritical shocks and also the region where an important part of electron heating takes place. All of these processes are crucially dependent upon the characteristic spatial scales of the ramp and foot region provided that the shock is stationary. The earliest studies of collisionless shocks identified nonlinearity, dissipation, and dispersion as the processes that arrest the steepening of the shock transition. Their relative role determines the scales of electric and magnetic fields, and so control the characteristics of processes such as of ion reflection, electron heating and particle acceleration. The purpose of this review is to address a subset of unresolved problems in collisionless shock physics from experimental point of view making use multi-point observations onboard Cluster satellites. The problems we address are determination of scales of fields and of a scale of electron heating, identification of energy source of precursor wave train, an estimate of the role of anomalous resistivity in energy dissipation process by means of measuring short scale wave fields, and direct observation of reformation process during one single shock front crossing...|$|R
40|$|A Priabonian {{carbonate}} ramp {{developed in}} the NW Rodnei Mountains {{as a part of}} a Paleogene sedimentary cover which overlies the metamorphic basement of the Eastern Carpathians. Two sections were sampled at different locations along the carbonate ramp. The deposits accumulated in a shallow environment, in which relative sea level change is seen as the main controlling factor of facies distribution. A shoreface → middle ramp → inner <b>ramp</b> <b>transition</b> was recorded in both sections. Associations of large benthic foraminifers and high siliciclastic input are the dominant features in the northern part of the ramp, while in the south corals and coralline algae thrived in an environment characterized by low hydrodynamic energy and clastic input. A 4 - 5 m thick intercalation identified in the middle ramp deposits of both studied sections shows a temporary change in fossil assemblages, with foraminifers almost completely replaced by red algae and rhodoliths, and extensive bioturbation caused by ostracods and gastropods. Towards the top of the carbonate deposits, large bivalve colonies and an increase in clastic input indicate a relative sea-level fall, which ultimately led to the cessation of carbonate sedimentation and the deposition of black shales on a basin-wide scale during the Lower Oligocene. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} {{margin of}} the Askrigg Block around Cracoe, North Yorkshire, shows a <b>transition</b> from carbonate <b>ramp</b> to reef-rimmed shelf margin, which, based on new foraminiferal/algal data, is now constrained to have initiated during the late Asbian. A late Holkerian to early Asbian ramp facies that included small mudmounds developed in comparatively deeper waters, in a transition zone between the proximal ramp, mudmound-free carbonates of the Scaleber Quarry Limestone Member (Kilnsey Formation) and the distal Hodderense Limestone and lower Pendleside Limestone formations of the adjacent Craven Basin. The ramp is envisaged as structurally fragmented, associated with sudden thickness and facies changes. The late Asbian to early Brigantian apron reefs and isolated reef knolls of the Cracoe Limestone Formation include massive reef core and marginal reef flank facies, the latter also including development of small mudmounds on the deeper water toes of back-reef flanks. The position of the apron/knoll reefs is constrained to the south (hangingwall) of the North Craven Fault, but it is syn-depositional displacement on the Middle Craven Fault that accounts for the thick reefal development. Subsequent inversion of this structure during the early Brigantian caused uplift and abandonment of the reefs and consequent burial by the Bowland Shale Formation...|$|R

40|$|A {{measurement}} {{campaign has}} been carried out to investigate the viscous flow effects in a fixed geometry two-dimensional scramjet inlet at Mach 7. The tests have been performed in a hypersonic blowdown wind-tunnel facility. The existing boundary layer separation due to shock interaction in the inlet throat can lead to inlet unstart. Therefore, an optional passive boundary layer bleed has been integrated at the throat. The passive bleed reduces the lip shock induced separation bubble in the throat significantly. The obtained experimental wall pressure distribution and pitot pressure profiles are discussed and compared to 2 -D and 3 -D computational fluid dynamics calculations.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{excitation}} energy for slow {{changes of the}} hopping parameter in the Falicov-Kimball model with nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory. The excitation energy vanishes algebraically for long ramp times with an exponent that depends on whether the ramp takes place within the metallic phase, within the insulating phase, or across the Mott <b>transition</b> line. For <b>ramps</b> within metallic or insulating phase the exponents are in agreement with a perturbative analysis for small ramps. The perturbative expression quite generally shows that the exponent depends explicitly on the spectrum of the system in the initial state and on the smoothness of the ramp protocol. This explains the qualitatively different behavior of gapless (e. g., metallic) and gapped (e. g., Mott insulating) systems. For gapped systems the asymptotic behavior of the excitation energy depends only on the ramp protocol and its decay becomes faster for smoother ramps. For gapless systems and sufficiently smooth ramps the asymptotics are ramp-independent and depend only on the intrinsic spectrum of the system. However, the intrinsic behavior is unobservable if the ramp is not smooth enough. This is relevant for ramps to small interaction in the fermionic Hubbard model, where the intrinsic cubic fall-off of the excitation energy cannot be observed for a linear ramp due to its kinks {{at the beginning and}} the end.

40|$|We report {{extensive}} simulation {{studies of}} phase behaviour in single component systems of particles interacting via a core-softened interparticle potential. Two recently proposed {{examples of such}} potentials are considered; {{one in which the}} hard core exhibits a shoulder, (Sadr-Lahijany et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 4895 (1998)) and the other in which the softening {{takes the form of a}} linear ramp (Jagla, Phys. Rev. E 63, 061501 (2001)). Using a combination of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo methods, we obtain the gas, liquid and solid phase behaviour of the shoulder model in two dimensions. We then focus on the thermodynamic anomalies of the liquid phase, namely maxima in the density and compressibility as a function of temperature. Analysis of the finite-size behaviour of these maxima suggests that, rather than stemming from a metastable liquid-liquid critical point, as previously supposed, they are actually induced by the quasi-continuous nature of the two dimensional freezing <b>transition.</b> For the <b>ramp</b> model in three dimensions, we confirm the existence of a stable liquid-liquid ("second") critical point occurring at higher pressure and lower temperature than the liquid-gas critical point. Both these critical points and portions of their associated coexistence curves are located to high precision. In contrast to the shoulder model, the observed thermodynamic anomalies of this model are found to be authentic, i. e. they are not engendered by an incipient new phase. We trace the locus of density and compressibility maxima, the former of which appears to converge on the second critical point. Comment: 35 pages, 20 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend towards}} low-floor trams which {{appeared}} during the recent decades brought up {{a variety of different}} solutions in vehicle design. Usually the operators preferred the 100 % low-floor vehicles, paying particular respect to disabled passengers. These trams have a constant floor height of not more than 350 mm throughout the whole vehicle. An indispensable precondition for this is to abandon the wheelsets and the principle of placing the drive motors between the wheels. Thus all according vehicle designs have independent wheels instead of the previously used conventional wheelsets. Moreover, the 100 % low-floor design reduces drastically the maximal yaw angle of the bogies. In order to allow appropriate yaw movements within the vehicles, the carbodies had to be split into a number of articulated sections, with the motor and trailer bogies nearly fixed to them. In consequence the different drivetrain solutions became numerous. This thesis analyses and compares characteristic designs of multi-articulated trams that have been acquired by a large number of tram operators: the Combino and Variobahn design. In addition the 70 % low-floor, conventional motor bogie-based tram type Cologne is analysed, which has also been acquired in large numbers. The analyses were mainly performed by means of multibody simulation and were focused on• the running behaviour in tangent track,• the permissibility of the current track design regulations with regard to the derailment safety, and• the passenger comfort in curve entry transitions. For the latter analysis a general distinction was made between two design variants: on the one hand the curve entry for tracks within the street, without <b>transition</b> and superelevation <b>ramp,</b> {{and on the other hand}} the curve entry for autonomous tracks with curve <b>transition</b> and superelevation <b>ramp.</b> The results showed that the running behaviour in tangent track is satisfactory for all vehicles, and there is no increase in the derailment risk, either. However, the analyses showed also that each of the vehicles exceeds the jerk limits defined by the according VDV regulation. It could also be shown that there is an inadequacy in the regulation criterion for the comfort in curve transitions. The latest operational and biomechanical experience demonstrates that the main comfort criterion is not the jerk but rather the frequency of the lateral oscillations, the mean lateral acceleration – considered over a period of 2 s – and the product of the lateral acceleration in the curve at the moment of maximal jerk and the reaction time of the passengers. The consequences which are relevant for the running dynamics are:• The current track design regulations can be retained without exceptions, as long as the vehicle concept and the bogie design are appropriate. • The operators’ guidelines concerning door arrangement and vehicle capacity must not have negative influences on the running dynamics, the derailment safety and the comfort of passengers and staff. • When the choice of the curve radius is restricted by existing buildings then the track design parameters must be chosen in a way that the running safety is not endangered in any operational condition. • The definition of limit values for lateral acceleration, jerk and permissible human exposure to mechanical vibrations should be brought to a safe basis by means of multidisciplinary discussions with experts in medicine, biomechanics, physiology and vehicle design...|$|R
40|$|Lower-extremity amputees face {{numerous}} challenges when {{returning to}} daily activities. Amongst these challenges {{is the ability}} to safely and dynamically transition from one locomotor state to another. Switching between level-ground, ramp, and stair locomotion poses an increased risk as lower-extremity functionality is compromised. Powered prosthetics have been proposed as a solution to this problem. Hypothetically, powered prosthetics would be able to return full functional to the amputated limb. The most common and successful source of information used in algorithms for lower-extremity prosthetics has been electromyography. However, in practice, amputees remain unable to easily actuate the mechanized joints of powered prostheses. Therefore, the current project aimed to identify myoelectric activation differences in lower-extremity musculature during the gait cycles preceding locomotor transition in able-bodied, trans-tibial, and trans-femoral subjects to assist efforts in developing robust classification algorithms for locomotor transitions. Analysis of electromyography was completed to determine if there were periods of activation where classification algorithms could utilize differences in myoelectric activation to appropriately control joint actuation in a subset of eight transitions that included level-ground locomotion and switching to either ramp or stair locomotion and vice versa. <b>Ramp</b> <b>transitions</b> were fundamentally similar to level-ground locomotion and elicited no differences in myoelectric activation. Stair transitions were found to alter muscle activation patterns in able-body and trans-tibial subjects. Trans-femoral subjects differentiated from able-bodied and trans-tibial subjects due to increased recruitment pattern variability. These patterns are distinct and may suggest individual learning patterns within the trans-femoral amputee population. Further investigation of these patterns may be warranted. Findings within able-bodied and trans-tibial subjects suggest common transition based differences within each respective population. Trans-tibial classification algorithms may be developed to utilize this information, using schemes that are focused on important areas during the gait cycle...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{intensive}} {{theoretical and}} experimental research, transition to turbulence in separated hypersonic ramp flows {{is still a}} challenge to predict. One {{of the most successful}} approaches to model the dominant mechanisms is the direct numerical simulation approach, which has demonstrated, despite the well known drawback of computationally costly simulations, the capability to generate reliable datasets. To allow calculations of the <b>transition</b> process on <b>ramp</b> configurations a validated DNS code with high resolution of the turbulent structures in the hypersonic flow regime is a necessity. The abilities of the 4 th-order finite-difference version of the DLR FLOWer code, derived originally for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) over recent years is a promising choice for the requested properties. In fact, it was shown in former studies that the resolution of transitional instabilities in supersonic boundary layers is very well within the range of this code. In the present study, different supersonic test cases are chosen from literature and compared with the actual simulations using this high-order version of the DLR FLOWer code. The results using higher-order Pade-filter approaches are encouraging. With this validation as a background, a supersonic ramp-test case was chosen for study. To resolve the transition process, different ramp-angles and Reynolds numbers were investigated to determine a transitional test case, for which turbulence can be resolved behind re-attachment. A hypersonic ramp with 12 degree angle of attack at a moderate Reynolds number was then chosen for three-dimensional DNS calculations of the transition process. These DNS were carried out with various grid densities and grid extents in the wall-normal and spanwise direction with good success. The investigation of different spanwise extents of the simulation region has demonstrated the capabilities of the code to predict the supersonic transition process...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} apatite fission-track {{analysis}} in 14 granitic-gneissic samples from two regional transects across the Borborema Plateau, northeastern Brazil, show evidence for two dominant paleothermal events: a Late Cretaceous cooling event beginning sometime between 100 and 90 Ma, {{and a second}} cooling event in the Neogene. The distribution of the fission-track results suggests that the cooling events have a broad regional expression and {{are consistent with the}} geologic record in the Araripe Basin, western Borborema Province, which attests to a post-Albian uplift of the whole region. We hypothesize that the first event is due to the uplift and denudation of regional, permanent topography generated after the breakup of Brazil and Africa. Such topography is predicted by models of continental margin extension in which continental lithosphere thinning is followed by thickening of the adjacent hinterland lithosphere and crust (Kusznir, N. J., Karner, G. D., 2007. Continental lithospheric thinning and breakup in response to upwelling divergent mantle flow: application to the Woodlark, Newfoundland and Iberia margins. In: Karner, G. D., Manatschal, G., Pinheiro, L. (Eds), Imaging, mapping and modeling continental lithosphere extension and breakup. Special Publication 282, Geological Society, London, pp. 389 – 419.). In northeastern Brazil, this extension-engendered topography may have been amplified by magmatic underplating related to the Saint Helena and Ascension plumes. The Miocene cooling event (20 – 0 Ma) occurred at a time characterized by the <b>transition</b> from carbonate <b>ramp</b> to progradational clastic systems on the Pernambuco–Paraíba margin and the offshore Potiguar Basin. This same stratigraphic response characterizes the Neogene stratigraphy of many passive margins and attests to a global increase in the delivery of clastics to margins, the simplest explanation of which is a climate change that accentuated erosion of pre-existing topography. Thus, the present rugged landscape of northeastern Brazil is interpreted to be a product of this younger denudation event. A corollary {{of this study is that}} the history, distribution and delivery of clastics to the northern and northeastern margins of Brazil are a function of the regional development of the continental landscape during the Late Cenozoic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} automatic shot boundary detection algorithms {{for the detection of}} cuts and gradual transitions in digital video sequences. The objective was to develop a fully automatic video segmentation system as a pre-processing step for video database retrieval management systems as well as other applications which has large video sequences as part of their systems. For die detection of cuts, we begin by looking at a set of baseline algorithms that look into measuring specific features of video images and calculating the dissimilarity of the measures between frames in the video sequence. We then propose two different approaches and compare them against the set of baseline algorithms. These approaches are themselves built upon the base set of algorithms. Observing that the baseline algorithms initially use hard thresholds to determine shot boundaries, we build Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to plot the characteristics of the algorithms when varying the thresholds. In the first approach, we look into combining the multiple algorithms {{in such a way that}} as a collective, the detection of cuts are improved. The results of the fusion are then compared against the baseline algorithms on the ROC curve. For the second approach, we look into having adaptive thresholds for the baseline algorithms. A selection of adaptive thresholding methods were applied to the data set and compared with the baseline algorithms that are using hard thresholds. In the case of gradual transition detection, an application of a filtering technique used to detect ramp edges in images is adapted for use in video sequences. The approach is taken by starting with the observation that shot boundaries represent edges in time, with cuts being sharp edges and gradual <b>transitions</b> closely approximating <b>ramp</b> edges. The methods that we propose reflect our concentration on producing a reliable and efficient shot boundary detection mechanism. In each instance, be it for cuts or gradual transitions, we tested our algorithms on a comprehensive set of video sequences, containing a variety of content and obtained highly competitive results...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate using RAMP, a complete starter feed (Cargill Corn Milling, Blair NE) which contains {{a high level of}} Sweet Bran and a minimal amount of forage, for receiving lightweight calves and adapting cattle to high-grain diets. Two {{experiments were}} conducted to compare feeding RAMP with a traditional receiving diet to lightweight calves for the first 30 d of the feeding period. Seven experiments compared using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets to a traditional grain adaptation program or evaluated using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets in fewer days. Three of these trials were metabolism studies that evaluated DMI and ruminal pH of cattle during grain adaptation. Feeding RAMP to newly received lightweight calves improved G:F and did not affect the incidence of BRD. Using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets resulted in increased G:F and HCW when compared using a traditional grain adaptation program with alfalfa hay. No major differences in ruminal pH were observed between cattle adapted with RAMP or a traditional system but RAMP decreased ruminal pH variation during grain adaptation which may suggest less acidosis. In a metabolism study eliminating the adaptation period resulted in decreased ruminal pH and increased pH variance when compared to longer more traditional adaptation with more step diets. Although pH was lower in the metabolism study for cattle <b>transitioned</b> directly from <b>RAMP</b> to a finishing diet, performance was not affected in 2 feedlot trials when compared to a 4 -step adaptation program with RAMP. In the final metabolism study, regardless of adaptation period length (10 or 22 d), RAMP treatments increased eating time and average ruminal pH during the adaptation period. This may suggest less acidosis when using RAMP to start cattle on feed. Cattle fed RAMP for 10 d can be transitioned directly to a finishing diet containing 47. 5 % Sweet Bran without negatively affecting performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Intrasalt carbonates of the Ediacaran–Cambrian Ara Group {{constitute}} a significant reservoir {{element of the}} intrasalt “stringer” play in Oman, in which dolomitic carbonates are encased in salt at depths of 3 to 7 km (1. 9 to 4. 3 mi). These reservoir carbonates have significant microbial influences. Although Ara Group reservoirs are mostly latest Precambrian, the models developed here may be applicable to younger microbially dominated carbonate reservoirs in basins of higher salinity when higher organisms are excluded, in lacustrine settings where calcified invertebrates are not {{a significant source of}} carbonate, or after periods of mass extinction before faunal recovery. A broad range of carbonate facies provides the context in which to understand the origin of the microbialite-dominated reservoirs developed across both ramp and rimmed shelf profiles. Major facies associations include carbonate-evaporite <b>transition</b> zone, deep <b>ramp</b> and slope, subtidal microbialites, clastic-textured carbonates, and restricted peritidal carbonates. Microbialites are subdivisible into a number of facies that all have significance in terms of understanding environmental history as well as reservoir properties, and that help in predicting the location of reservoir fairways. Microbially influenced facies include shallow subtidal thrombolites with massive clotted textures and very high initial porosities (> 50 %), shallow subtidal pustular laminites with cm-scale variability of lamina morphology, deeper subtidal crinkly laminites that show mm-scale variability of lamina morphology, and intertidal tufted laminates that show mm- to cm-scale tufted textures. Other reservoir facies are more conventional grainy carbonates including ripple cross-stratified grainstone–packstone, hummocky cross-stratified grainstone–packstone, flat pebble conglomerate, ooid and intraclast grainstone–packstone, and Cloudina grainstone–packstone. These facies are almost invariably dolomitized and all have moderate to excellent reservoir quality. These facies comprise carbonate platforms, broken up during salt tectonics, that range up to 160 m (525 ft) in thickness and extended laterally, prior to halokinesis, for tens to over 50 km (31 mi). The distribution of reservoir facies follows sequence stratigraphic predictions, with microbialites occurring in every accommodation profile. Late highstand and early transgressive systems tracts favor greater lateral extent of thrombolite build-ups, whereas later transgressive to early highstand system tracts favor greater lateral discontinuity and compartmentalization of buildup reservoir facies. Pustular laminites occur in close association with thrombolite buildups but form laterally extensive sheets in late transgressive to late highstand periods. Crinkly laminites form during late transgressive to early highstand systems tracts and may represent maximum flooding intervals when the flux of carbonate sediment was greatly reduced allowing pelagically derived organics to accumulate...|$|R
40|$|Background Laying hens {{are often}} kept in barn or free-range systems where they must {{negotiate}} level {{changes in the}} house to access resources. However, collisions and resultant keel fractures are commonplace. Producers sometimes add ramps to make raised areas more accessible but designs vary and very little research has investigated bird preference or behaviour when using different ramp designs, or the effect of ramp design on falls and collisions. Methods Two ramp designs were studied in an experimental setting—a ramp made of plastic poultry slats (grid ramp, GR) and a ramp made of wooden rungs (ladder ramp, LR). Sixty-four young female hens were trained to move to a food reward and this was used to test their behavioural responses when first negotiating the two different ramps during individual tests. Both upward and downward <b>transitions</b> were studied. <b>Ramp</b> preference was also tested using a room that replicated a commercial single-tier system with both types of ramp available. Birds were placed in this room in groups of 16 for three days and their use of the ramps studied. Results A greater percentage of birds successfully completed (reached the reward bowl) on the GR than the LR during both upward (58 % vs 37 %) and downward (83 % vs 73 %) transitions, and a smaller percentage of birds made zero attempts to use the GR than the LR (upwards: 13 % vs 56 %, downwards: 8 % vs 26 %). When making a downward transition, more hesitation behaviours were seen (head orientations, stepping on the spot, moving away) for the LR. However, more head orientations were seen for the GR during the upward transition. Birds were more likely to abort attempts (an attempt began when a bird placed both feet on the ramp) to move up the GR than the LR. Birds took longer to negotiate the LR than the GR in both directions, and more pauses were seen during a successful upward transition on the LR. Birds were more likely to move down the GR by walking/running whereas birds tended to jump over the entire LR. More collisions with the food reward bowl were seen for the LR. In the group tests, birds preferred to use the GR, with more transitions seen at all timepoints. However, in these tests, birds preferred to rest on the LR with greater numbers of birds counted on this type of ramp during scan sampling at all timepoints. Discussion Behavioural results suggest that the GR was easier for the birds to use than the LR, particularly on the downward transition. The GR was also less likely to result in collisions. However, the upward transition may be more difficult on the GR for some birds, potentially because of the inability to pause on a level surface during the transition. The results suggest that the GR was preferred by pullets for moving between a raised area and the ground but the LR was preferred for resting...|$|R
40|$|The Middle and Upper Devonian (Givetian-Frasnian) shallow-water {{carbonate}} facies {{of western}} Europe were deposited as a large-scale transgressive succession over continental facies of the Old Red Continent. The transgression {{was in a}} northerly direction, reaching the southern Ardennes by the lower Eifelian and the Aachen area of Germany by the middle Givetian. Carbonate sedimentation continued through to the middle Frasnian, when a major pulse m relative sea-level rise drowned the platform. The carbonate platform had a complex internal structure, with three major palaeosettings. During the Eifelian, a storm-influenced homoclinal ramp existed {{over much of the}} Ardennes. Sedimentation was mostly open-marine in nature, with a protected back-ramp and tidal-Oats. The Givetian saw a <b>transition</b> from a <b>ramp</b> to shelf setting, with stromatoporoid reefs at the shelf edge providing protection for abroad shelf lagoon. The shelf had an ESE-WNW trend and extended from Boulogne (northern France) in the west to Aachen (western Germany) in the east. East of the river Rhine in the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge area of Germany, and in Southwest England, isolated carbonate complexes developed. These were positioned either on the shelf-edge, within the shelf or upon topographic highs within the basin. Synsedimentary tectonism and volcanism strongly influenced their development. As a result of their areal extent, lagoonal environments were studied extensively in shelf and isolated complexes. Palaeontology and sedimentology were used to identify 14 major microfacies within the lagoonal successions, which could be broadly categorised into four major groups. The semi-restricted subtidal microfacies group has a rich faunal assemblage which, although diverse, did not represent fully open-marine deposition. Sedimentation was entirely subtidal in nature. The restricted subtidal microfacies group is either characterised by monospecific fossil assemblages (chiefly molluscs or amphiporoids), or by macrofossil-poor facies. These facies represent poorly-circulated, subtidal environments which may have been subjected to flucmating salinities The intertidal microfacies group is characterised by fenestral limestones, which are commonly poorly-fossiliferous. Finally the supratidal microfacies group is typified by dolomudstones, microbial laminites and calcretes. A metre-scale cyclicity is prevelant in these lagoonal facies and two major types of cycle have been identified. Subtidal cycles show a decrease in circulation, decrease in diversity of organisms and increase in fluctuation of salinity upwards through the cycle. Peritidal cycles shallow upwards from a subtidal base through to an intertidal or supratidal cap. Subtidal cycles seem particularly common within the isolated carbonate complexes, yet both peritidal and subtidal cycles are identified in the shelf lagoon. The distribution of facies and cycles was controlled by a complex interaction of eustasy and differential subsidence. The setting (i. e., whether it was the shelf lagoon, or isolated carbonate complex) also influenced this distribution. Fischer plots were used successfully to correlate successions across the carbonate platform, and to identify areas of condensed or expanded sedimentation. Cycles were calculated to have a duration of approximately 42, 000 years for the Upper Givetian. The magnitude of relative sea- level change was in the order of l- 3 m. The development of the metre-scale cyclicity is best explained by orbital forcing, yet this signature has been overprinted by autocyclic and tectonic noise. Third-order eustatic sea-level fluctuations were delineated by major marine transgressions, and a eustatic sea-level curve was established for the study area...|$|R
40|$|Menorca is {{subdivided}} in main {{regions with}} different stratigraphic and tectonic characteristics. To the north, folded, thrusted and faulted Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Paleogene rocks compose the Tramuntana region. To the south, upper-Miocene carbonate and, locally, siliciclastic rocks compose the Migjorn region. Upper Miocene rocks unconformably overlie Paleozoic to middle Miocene basement. In the Migjorn, three Miocene depositional units were recognized (Pomar et al., 2002 and references herein) : the Basal Conglomeratic Unit (Burdigalian p. p.), interpreted as near-shore to fan-delta deposits; the Lower Bar Unit (early Tortonian), {{interpreted as a}} distally steepened carbonate ramp; the Reef Complex (upper Tortonian - lower Messinian), a reef-rimmed platform prograding complex. Within the ramp, Pomar et al. (2002) distinguished four facies belts: fan-delta conglomerates and bioturbated packstones (inner ramp), crossbedded grainstones (middle- ramp), rhodolithic rudstone clinobeds (ramp slope) and fine-grained wackestone-packstone with planktonic foraminifers (outer ramp). The cross-bedded units here analysed occur at the <b>transition</b> lower slope-outer <b>ramp.</b> They infill the axial depression of large slide/slump scars. These scars truncate the gently, 10 °- 12 ° basinward dipping, slope-to-outer ramp succession. The wedge-shaped cross-bedded units, 10 - 12 m thick, pinch out basinward and extend laterally for tens of meters. Several amalgamated cross-laminated bodies, 40 cm- to 2 m wide each with erosive base compose each unit. They are composed by rhodolithic-mollusk rudstone with coarse grain/packstone matrix. Porosity is very high, cementation low and dolomitization patchy. Matrix consists of red-algal-, bivalve-, echinoderm, coral fragments, and benthic foraminifers. Ooids are, locally abundant along with limestone pebbles. Pebbles are flat, 5 - to 10 -cm wide, of oolitic grainstone, sometimes with mollusk borings. Cross bedding is underlined by the abundance and orientation of coarser components. Cross-laminae within units dip upslope (8 ° to 35 °) forming backstepping backsets. Upslope bedform migration has been explained as forming when a supercritical flow encounters a local obstruction (or a local break on the slope), and a hydraulic jump may occur within the flow, upcurrent from the obstruction. Sediment will be therefore deposited at the obstruction forming an up-flow-dipping slipface that will tend to accrete and migrate in the upflow direction. In Menorca, these sedimentary structures have been interpreted by Pomar et al. (2002), as backset beds related to up-stream migrating hydraulic jump where slide scars acted as slope channels funneling platform debris down the slope. The occurrence of aragonitic components (oolites, corals) within these units, absent in the ramp system, and the scars development {{at the end of}} the ramp progradation, suggest the involvement of Reef Complex sediment. Therefore, those events, involved both sediment of the upper Tortonian distally steepened ramp and part of the Reef Complex. These structures have been mostly described in different environments of terrigenous systems. In carbonate systems are scarcely described and none from carbonate ramps. The architecture characterizing these upslope cross-bedded beds seams to call for a scour-and-fill process, therefore initially the action of a strong scouring event immediately followed by depositional events. The presence of these bodies in various intervals suggests the repetitive occurrence of this process. In the studied system, deep-scouring events on the platform could be represented by slope failures that induced tsunami events or by eustatic variations, able to create strong downslope flows directed offshore. Scours have been rapidly infilled by shallow-water sediment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhistler wave {{trains are}} {{observed}} in the foot region of high Mach number quasiperpendicular shocks. The waves are oblique {{with respect to the}} ambient magnetic field as well as the shock normal. The Poynting flux of the waves is directed upstream in the shock normal frame starting from the ramp of the shock. This suggests that the waves {{are an integral part of}} the shock structure with the dispersive shock as the source of the waves. These observations lead to the conclusion that the shock ramp structure of supercritical high Mach number shocks is formed as a balance of dispersion and nonlinearity. Shock plasma waves are ubiquitous in our Universe. They play an important role in redistributing kinetic energy in supersonic flow into plasma thermal energy and energetic particles. In particular, Earth's bow shock defines the boundary between the supersonic solar wind plasma and the subsonic region of the near-Earth space environment. Despite the absence of collisions, low Mach number collisionless shocks are treated as steady state fast magne-tosonic nonlinear waves or discontinuities in a dissipative MHD approximation. This allows one to determine the asymptotic state of the plasma and magnetic field across a shock, by using the Rankine-Hugoniot conservation laws. Any deviation from MHD such as two-fluid or kinetic descriptions results in the appearance of dispersive effects. When the Mach number of the shock increases past a critical Mach number, M crit, inferred in the frame of a MHD description, neither resistive nor viscous effects can provide sufficient dissipation to sustain a stationary shock transition [1]. For these so-called supercritical shocks the major dissipation mechanism is related to reflected ions [2 – 4] that require a kinetic description. It is well known that a subcritical shock has a nonlinear whistler wave train upstream of its front [5, 6]. The major transition of such a dispersive shock, the ramp, behaves as the largest peak of the whistler precursor wave package [7 – 10]. The presence of whistler or fast magnetosonic precursor wave trains in supercritical shocks as well was experimentally established in [11 – 13]. These whistler waves have rather large amplitudes, and their role in energy transformation and redistribution between different particle populations and in the formation of the shock front structure is still an open question. Often the precursor waves are almost phase standing in the shock frame. However, their group velocity can still be greater than zero in the shock reference frame, which would allow energy flow in the form of Poynting flux to be emitted towards the upstream of the shock transition. In this Letter we address this problem and present the first direct measurement of the Poynting flux of the upstream whistler waves. It has been suggested that the shock front structure of quasiperpendicular supercritical shocks is formed similarly to that of subcritical shocks [14]. The observed dynamic features of shocks have also been studied extensively using computer particle-in-cell (PIC) or hybrid simulations, often with focus on the precursor wave activity and reflected ions [15 – 17]. From a kinetic viewpoint, however, it may be argued that the shock-reflected ions change the physical picture and that the principal scales, temporal and spatial, could be determined by the characteristics of the reflected ion population [18]. Upstream waves can then be generated due to counterstreaming ions and electrons in the shock front region, forming unstable particle distributions with respect to some wave modes [16, 17, 19]. While this is probably the case for some higher frequency waves, our analysis below leads to the conclusion that the source of the upstream low frequency whistler waves is related to the presence of the nonlinear <b>ramp</b> <b>transition,</b> emitting smaller scale dispersive waves towards the upstream flow. The existence of phase-standing upstream whistler waves depends on the value of the upstream flow speed Mach number relative to the phase velocity. If the Mach number of the shock does not exceed the whistler critical Mach number M w ¼ V w;max =V A ¼ 1 = 2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi m i =m e p cos Bn, the highest possible phase velocity, then phase-standing (linear) whistler wave trains can exist upstream of the shock [9, 14]. In the above equation V A is the Alfvén speed and Bn is the angle between the upstream magnetic field and the normal to the shock. Below we establish the energy source of the waves by calculating the Poynting flux of the waves in the normal incidence frame (NIF) of the shock, using multisatellit...|$|R
40|$|The upper Miocene units {{cropping}} {{out along}} the southern coast of the Island of Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain), are mainly represented by two carbonate depositional systems: an early Tortonian distally steepened ramp (Lower Bar Unit) and an upper Tortonian – lower Messinian reef-rimmed platform prograding complex (Reef Complex). Within the distally steepened ramp, Pomar et al. (2002) distinguished four facies belts: fan-delta conglomerates passing upwards to bioturbated packstones (inner ramp), cross-bedded grainstones (middle- ramp), clinostratified rhodolithic rudstone (ramp slope) and fine-grained wackestonepackstone with planktonic foraminifera (outer ramp). The backset-bedded units analysed in this work are placed at the transition between toe-of-slope and outer ramp sediments, below the wave-base-level. They infill the axial depression of large slide/slump scars. These scars truncate the gently, 10 °- 12 ° basinward dipping, slope-to-outer ramp clinoforms. Backset beds are cross-bedded forms that dip against the direction of flow of the depositing currents, therefore they present foresets migrating upcurrent (Gary et al., 1972). These sedimentary structures are well known and largely described on the foreset and toeset of Gilbert-type fan delta (Postma, 1984; Massari, 1984, 1996; Nemec, 1990). In carbonate depositional systems these type of bedforms are rarely found and only little described. The backset-bedded units, here analysed, are channel-like, wedge-shaped, 10 - 12 m thick, pinching out landward and extend laterally for tens of meters. Each unit is formed by several amalgamated set of backset beds, 40 cm to 2 m thick. These units are mainly conglomerates composed by bioclastic coarse-grained grainstone to rudstone. Large components are rhodoliths, bivalves, skeletal and ooid-rich pebbles to boulders, gastropods and corals. Matrix is of a bioclastic coarse-grained sand to fine gravel, made of fragments of bivalves, gastropods, rhodoliths, bryozoans, algae, echinoids, loose ooids and planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Ooids are locally very abundant both in matrix and as main components of pebbles. Pebbles are mainly flattened, elongated, of average size 6 - 8 cm (a-axis) and sometimes have mollusc borings on their surface: large (20 - 30 cm) rounded and spherical boulders are locally present. Intergranular and intergranular porosity is very high, cementation low and dolomitization patchy. Foreset laminae dip upslope with varying angles ranging from almost horizontal to 30 °; higher angles are mostly found in the basinward part of the unit. Lamination is underline by the orientation along laminae of coarser components especially of bivalves, pebbles and rhodoliths. Grain-size distribution has a particular trend that shows a progressive decrease in size landwards and upwards. Sorting may noticeably vary being high or absent in different bodies. The lower boundary of the backset-bedded units is represented by scour surfaces which, on a parallel-to-flow section are almost concordant with the stratification below, while on a perpendicular-to-flow section are concave-up shaped, presenting the very steep walls. The study of different outcrops along the coast evidenced some important variation in components: moving northward composition changed from almost completely rhodolithic-dominated to rhodolith-bivalve-ooid-pebble-dominated to bivalve-ooid-pebble-dominated with first findings of corals. Upslope bedform migration has been explained as forming when a supercritical flow encounters a local obstruction or a local break on the slope, and a hydraulic jump may occur within the flow, upcurrent from the obstruction. Sediment will be therefore deposited at the obstruction forming an up-flow-dipping slipface that will tend to accrete and migrate in the upflow direction (Nemec, 1990 and reference therein). The backset deposits of Menorca are found in deep-water settings but they are composed of shallow-water sediment. The formation of these backset beds is interpreted {{to be related to}} high energy storm-events able to remove sediment from shallow water and to transport it into deeper position. The sediment-rich outgoing flows channalized and accelerated along slide-scar axis, eroding and rapidly infilling up-slope the scours. In this portion of the ramp preservation potential is higher thanks to sediment deposition which buries and preserves these structures. The repetitive occurrence of backset bedded units within the outer-ramp sediments and the progressive variation in composition suggest that those processes where probably active at the <b>transition</b> between the <b>ramp</b> and the reef systems. Therefore the formation of these sedimentary structures is interpreted to be strictly link to concurrence of peculiar morphological features, hydrodynamic energy and grain-size availability. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) numerical simulation have been performed as an integrated part of this work to improve the understanding of the development of hydraulic jumps within concentrated density flows. The simulated parameters do not refer to the example of Menorca but to turbidity currents for which finer-grain size (sand-size) have been used in a smaller-scale topography compared to the one studied in outcrop. The work presented proposes some new stating points for further simulations to constrain more precisely the main parameters controlling and determining the occurrence of a hydraulic jump and the consequent deposition of sediment with backset bedding...|$|R
