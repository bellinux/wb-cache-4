5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and {{is different from}} the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E

25|$|The EU {{is based}} on a series of treaties. These first {{established}} the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>founding</b> treaties. These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers <b>to</b> implement <b>those</b> goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants. The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.|$|R

50|$|Adam wrote {{a series}} of {{historical}} novels that dealt with {{the period of the}} Napoleonic Wars and their aftermath; the first installment in the series, La Force, was published in 1899. Together with Jean Moréas, he co-wrote Les Demoiselles Goubert, which was a novel that marked the transition between Naturalism and Symbolism in French literature. His novel Stephanie, which appeared in 1913, argued in favour of arranged marriages as opposed <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>founded</b> on romantic attachments.|$|R
5|$|In stone carving {{there are}} a number of simple stone heads from Scotland, like that found at Coupar Angus in Perthshire, that may date from the Iron Age. They are similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> across Great Britain and Ireland, {{although}} they are difficult to date and may have been made much later.|$|E
5|$|Located on the {{watershed}} between the Rhône and the Po rivers, the Mont Blanc massif is also situated {{between the two}} different climatic regions of the northern and western Alps {{and that of the}} southern Alps.

5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends going down the group for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, are similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> among their group 4–8 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches {{their position in the}} f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E

50|$|This {{is all a}} {{leap from}} the Society's {{beginning}} in the late 19th century, when its humane officers ventured out on horseback rather than in air-conditioned spacious trucks, their welfare efforts aimed more at “work” animals rather than “companion” animals. But even then, education was a top priority. In a society where animal information was very basic, it fell <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>founding</b> members <b>to</b> raise public awareness about the proper care, feeding and humane treatment of animals. The vision of those early pioneers guides the Society's efforts today.|$|R
5|$|DragonFly's kernel is a hybrid, {{containing}} {{features of}} both monolithic and microkernels, {{such as the}} message passing capability of microkernels enabling larger portions of the OS to benefit from protected memory, as well as retaining the speed of monolithic kernels for certain critical tasks. The messaging subsystem being developed is similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in microkernels such as Mach, though it is less complex by design. DragonFly's messaging subsystem {{has the ability to}} act in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full Cushion {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers {{were designed to}} be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side {{at the center of}} the cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> at the Chaco site.|$|E

5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly comparable <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in neutron stars – quark matter {{is expected to}} degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge {{would be able to}} pass through it with no resistance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth {{millennium}} BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick {{close to the}} River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of prehistoric lake dwellings, which were {{likely to have been}} similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble, and clay.|$|E
5|$|Seibal {{was first}} settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period. It {{reached its peak}} {{population}} in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, {{at the end of}} the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE). Ceramics from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region. A cruciform Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the artifacts were probably manufactured at La Venta.

5|$|The crystal {{structure}} of octaphenylrhodocene shows a staggered conformation (similar {{to that of}} ferrocene, and {{in contrast to the}} eclipsed conformation of ruthenocene). The rhodium–centroid distance is 1.904Å and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths average 2.26Å; the carbon–carbon bond lengths average 1.44Å. These distances are all similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation described above, with the one difference that the effective size of the rhodium centre appears larger, an observation consistent with the expanded ionic radius of rhodium(II) compared with rhodium(III).|$|E
