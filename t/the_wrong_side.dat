5|$|An inquest in April 2008 {{found that}} Jones had sped over a {{pedestrian}} crossing on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the road, {{leading to a}} head-on collision. His death was recorded as an accident, but {{it was confirmed that}} had he survived, he would have been facing two charges of death by dangerous driving.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the castle, {{facing away from}} the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching {{down to the ground}} and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then {{a whole bunch of}} copycat wankers after us.|$|E

50|$|Possibly as payback {{for staying}} up later than her, the player's little sister has taken {{all of the}} trains and is sending freight cars down the line toward a {{three-way}} switch under the player's control. The job is to sort the cars down the right line. If one is put in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>siding,</b> it's immediately game over for that job, and the mission must be restarted.|$|R
50|$|After {{months of}} {{speculation}} {{on the official}} Marillion website, the album was finally released on a 33⅓ rpm double-vinyl LP in November 2013. The track listing was {{identical to the original}} CD release, although some copies included a manufacturers mistake whereby the labels of side 3 & 4 were stamped on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> actual vinyl discs. In other words, side 3 was actually side 4 and vice versa.|$|R
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E
5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} {{land for a}} school in the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E
50|$|In this job, the {{objective}} is to sort the explosive loads (oil, diesel fuel, dynamite, and nitro) onto the right sidings without getting into the sidings. If the player uncouples the needed freight car on the hill, it will automatically roll quickly to whichever siding the player is switched to. If a car travels to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>siding</b> or crashes, <b>the</b> mission is failed, and the results are potentially devastating.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> movie <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> of <b>the</b> Road and soundtrack (1981) gave broad {{exposure}} to the bands Us Mob and No Fixed Address and highlighted Indigenous disadvantage in urban Australia.|$|R

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years introduced him to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, {{he and his brother}} Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed {{with the objective of}} moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E
5000|$|For Adolphe Sax is {{the first}} album by free jazz saxophonist Peter Brötzmann, {{released}} on his own Brö label in 1967. It was reissued on LP by FMP in 1971 (most copies had labels affixed to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides)</b> and then reissued on CD by the Atavistic label in 2002. This reissue featured the added track [...] "Everything". Adolph Sax was the inventor of many instruments including the first saxophones. No edition of the album has included writing credits.|$|R
5000|$|An earlier, stripped-down {{version of}} [...] "Is It True?" [...] {{featured}} as a B-side {{to the single}} [...] "Hips And Lips" [...] from The National Health. During the album campaign for Too Much Information, a double A-side single, [...] "Random Regrets / On The Sly", was released on 7-inch vinyl for Record Store Day 2014, consisting of two offcuts from the recording sessions for The National Health and Too Much Information respectively. An interesting feature of this release is that all copies pressed accidentally had the labels pressed onto <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> record because of a factory error.|$|R
5000|$|... {{there are}} nearly 100 films {{in various stages of}} production. <b>The</b> 2016 film <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> Raju won <b>the</b> Best Feature Film in Gujarati at the 64th National Film Awards.|$|R
5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become stranded on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2003, {{near his}} home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG and went onto <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the road before colliding with a Renault Scénic. A {{passenger}} in the Renault, Douglas Graham, was killed in the incident, whilst his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were severely injured. Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charge, though later pleaded guilty to charges of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.|$|E
60|$|The Wizard now rose, {{took off}} the coat with the button heads, and spread it on <b>the</b> floor, <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> up. At once there crept from beneath it a bear, a wolf, a cat, a weasel, and a field-mouse, who all rushed from the room and escaped into the mountains.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "trojan" [...] {{originally}} {{referred to}} the [...] "trojan asteroids" [...] (Jupiter trojans) that orbit close to the Lagrangian points of Jupiter. These have long been named after characters from the Trojan War of Greek mythology. By convention, the asteroids orbiting near the [...] point of Jupiter are named after the characters from the Greek side of the war, whereas those orbiting near the [...] of Jupiter are from the Trojan side. There are two exceptions, which were named before the convention was put in place, the Greek-themed 617 Patroclus and the Trojan-themed 624 Hektor, which were assigned to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "We Have Survived" [...] {{is a song}} {{originally}} {{performed by}} No Fixed Address. It was composed by Bart Willoughby when he was 18. It first appear in <b>the</b> film <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> of <b>the</b> Road and on its soundtrack and was later included on No Fixed Address's album From My Eyes. It has since been included in The Black Arm Bands concert murundak.|$|R
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major Sefton Brancker of the War Office conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in Ickenham, and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station {{but it was not}} until January 1915 that the British government officially requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the railway line, including the old Hill Farm.|$|E
50|$|The Luxury Flats {{rented a}} house in Hudson and lived {{together}} there. They made demos and eventually self released an album called <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> of <b>the</b> Cap Stand and went on some self booked tours across <b>the</b> USA. <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> of <b>the</b> Cap Stand was produced by Kenny Siegal at Old Soul Studios, engineered by Tom Shick at Old Soul, mixed by Bryce Goggin at Trout Recordings, and mastered by Fred Kevorkian at Avatar Studios. The album art work was done by Nicky Karas and Joe Terry.|$|R
50|$|In St. Petersburg, {{the task}} of {{reassembling}} the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. Tilesius' task was made easier {{by the fact that}} the Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that Tilesius was able to use as a reference. Tilesius had wooden replicas made to replace the missing leg bones. His reconstruction was one of the first attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. While most of the reconstruction is correct, Tilesius made a glaring error by mounting the tusks on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899 and the correct placement of mammoth's tusks would still be a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|Large {{numbers of}} gallowglass septs settled in Ireland after being dispossessed of their lands in Scotland for {{choosing}} <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> in <b>the</b> Wars of Scottish Independence. The first and probably {{most famous of}} these were the MacSweeneys, settled by the O’Donnells in north Donegal. These were followed by MacDonnells, MacCabes and several other groups settled by powerful Irish nobles in different areas. The gallowglasses were attractive as a heavily armoured, trained aristocratic infantry to be relied upon as a strong defence for holding a position, unlike most Irish foot soldiers, who were lower class and less well armoured than the typical Irish noble who fought as cavalry. In time there came to be many native Irish gallowglasses as the term came to mean a type of warrior rather than an ethnic designation.|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} attempt to relieve Mantua, Vukassovich {{participated in the}} Tyrol Corps' {{victories}} at Cembra on 2 November and the Battle of Calliano on 6–7 November. On the 17th, his troops battled {{their way out of}} the Adige River gorge to link up with Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko's column on the heights. Together they routed the French at Rivoli Veronese. After Bonaparte won the Battle of Arcole, the French army commander drove the Tyrol Corps back to Trento. During the fourth attempt to relieve Mantua, Jozsef Alvinczi directed Vukassovich to lead his 6th Column down the east bank of the Adige River. His artillery supported the attack of Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen on the west bank of the river, but he exerted little other influence on the disastrous result of the Battle of Rivoli because his troops were on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the river.|$|E
5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side,</b> and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E
50|$|After {{the battle}} of Montaperti where Siena, a Ghibelline city, {{defeated}} Guelph Florence on 4 September 1260, Colle Val d'Elsa found itself in the Guelph camp. Indeed, Colle had ended up as a center for many former citizens of Siena who, finding themselves on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> (Guelph) <b>side,</b> had been persecuted and driven into exile by Siena's dominant Ghibelline party.|$|R
50|$|The {{cab forward}} design was widely {{used by the}} Southern Pacific Railroad, which {{developed}} it {{to deal with the}} peculiar problems of its routes. The 39 long tunnels and nearly 40 mi of snow sheds of the Sierra Nevada Mountains could funnel dangerous exhaust fumes back into the crew compartment of a conventional locomotive. After a number of crews nearly asphyxiated, the locomotive was run in reverse. This meant that the tender was leading the train, which introduced new problems. The tender blocked the view ahead and put crewmen on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> cab for seeing signals. The tenders were not designed to be pushed at the lead of the train, which limited speeds. Southern Pacific commissioned Baldwin Locomotive Works to build a prototype cab-forward locomotive, then ordered more units before the prototype had even arrived.|$|R
5000|$|Sherbrooke {{declared}} [...] "New Ireland" [...] (Eastern Maine) {{a province}} of British North America (Canada) and left General Gosselin in Castine to govern it. For the next 8 months (from {{the fall of}} 1814 to the spring of 1815), the Penobscot River was essentially an international boundary. That Hampden and Bangor were on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> (American) <b>side</b> might have contributed to their rough treatment.|$|R
