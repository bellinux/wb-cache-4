This paper uses the 1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) to examine trip chaining behavior of adult men and women traveling Monday through Friday. The data show that women continue to make more trips to perform household-sustaining activities such as shopping and family errands {{to a greater extent than}} men. Women, especially with children in the household, are more likely to chain these household sustaining trips to the trip to and from work. Women’s participation in the labor force is at an all time high, but women’s patterns in travel to work are different from men’s patterns, and vary with family and life cycle status. The type and location of jobs that women take are likely affected by their greater household and family responsibilities. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future is whether and how the changes in women’s status in the workplace, and perhaps the concomitant change in the household dynamics and responsibilities, will affect travel behavior of both men and women.

It argues on this basis {{that the most important}} domain for improving accountability is through the political relations between citizens, civil society, and state leadership. The evidence broadly suggests that when higher-level political leadership provides sufficient or appropriate powers for citizen participation in holding within-state agencies or frontline providers accountable, there is frequently positive impact on outcomes. However, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> remaining <b>for</b> such types of interventions is how to improve the incentives of higher-level leadership to pursue appropriate policy design and implementation.

Ad-ditionally, a transformation of the classical TDM-based backbone networks to packet networks with Carrier Ethernet as the target technology occurs. The standardization process of 100 Gbps Ethernet is under way. This not only poses big challenges to transmission but also to packet processing technologies. However, recent announcements from network processing unit (NPU) vendors promise that packet processing at 100 Gbps is feasible. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> system manufacturers now is, whether this trend will continue and finally lead to 1 Tbps packet switching, or whether there are technological roadblocks that inhibit this development path. In this paper, we address this question and identify packet processing performance, packet buffer throughput, chip-to-chip interface speed, and power dissipation as the most critical factors. We discuss their limiting factors as well as architectural and technological trends that can further increase their performance. Based on these investigations and extrapolating anticipated technological advances we expect that 1 Tbps packet processing and switching could be introduced in the network within several years. Since this, however, not only depends on technological but also on economical factors, we show how slight modifications of the network architecture and protocols could alleviate some implementation complexities and thus reduce the overall cost. ...|$|E

Are we finally moving from a scattered intelligence to a coherent space of collaborative intelligence? How close we are to the vision of the Educational Semantic Web and what do we need to do in order to realize it? Two main challenges can be seen in this direction: on the one hand, to achieve interoperability among various educational systems and on the other hand, to have automated, structured and unified authoring support for their creation. In the spirit of the Semantic Web a key to enabling the interoperability is to capitalize on the (1) semantic conceptualization and ontologies, (2) common standardized communication syntax, and (3) large-scale service-based integration of educational content and functionality provision and usage. A central role in achieving unified authoring support plays the process-awareness of authoring tools, which should reflect the semantic evolution of e-learning systems. The purpose of this paper is to outline the state-of-the-art research along those lines and to suggest a realistic way towards the Educational Semantic Web. With regard to the latter we first propose a modular semantic-driven and service-based interoperability framework, in order to open up, share and reuse educational systems ’ content and knowledge components.

5000|$|With a terse lucidity that ranged, with unsparing meticulousness, {{over the}} huge {{archives}} of Nazism, Hilberg delineated {{the history of}} the mechanisms, political, legal, administrative and organizational, whereby the Holocaust was perpetrated, as it was seen through German eyes, often by the anonymous clerks whose unquestioning dedication to their duties was central to the efficacy of the industrial project of genocide. To that end, Hilberg refrained from laying emphasis on the suffering of Jews, the victims, or their lives in the concentration camps. The Nazi program entailed the destruction of all peoples whose existence was deemed incompatible with the world-historical destiny of a pure master race - and to accomplish this project, they had to develop techniques, muster resources, make bureaucratic decisions, organize fields and camps of extermination and recruit cadres capable of executing the Final Solution. It was enough to chase down each intricate strand of communication over how to conduct the operation efficiently through the enormous archival papertrail to show how this took place. Thus his discourse probed the bureaucratic means for implementing genocide, in order to let the implicit horror of the process speak for itself. In this he differed radically from those who had focused heavily on final responsibilities, as for example in the case of predecessor Gerald Reitlinger's groundbreaking history of the subject. Because of this layered departmentalized structure of the bureaucracy overseeing the intricate policies of classifying, mustering and deporting victims, individual functionaries saw their roles as distinct from the actual 'perpetration' of the Holocaust. Thus,'(f)or these reasons, an administrator, clerk or uniformed guard never referred to himself as a perpetrator.' Hilberg made it clear, however, that such functionaries were quite aware of their involvement in what was a process of destruction. Hilberg's minute documentation thus constructed a functional analysis of the machinery of genocide, while leaving unaddressed any questions of historical antisemitism, and possible structural elements in Germany's historical-social tradition which might have conduced to the unparalleled industrialization of the European Jewish Catastrophe by that country. Yehuda Bauer, a lifelong adversary and friend of Hilberg, who often clashed polemically with the man he considered 'without fault' over what Bauer saw as the latter's failure to deal with the complex dilemmas of Jews caught up in this machinery, recalls often prodding Hilberg on his exclusive focus on the how of the Holocaust rather than the why. According to Bauer, Hilberg [...] "did not ask <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> fear that <b>the</b> answers would be too little" [...] or, as Hilberg himself says interviewed in Lanzmann's film, [...] "I have never begun by asking <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>questions,</b> because I was always afraid that I would come up with small answers." ...|$|R

According to the latest statistics from market research and technology assessment firm Daratech, sales revenue for computer-aided engineering (CAE) software and services grew from $ 2. 31 billion in 2005 to more than $ 2. 43 billion in 2006. Daratech forecasts a {{compound annual growth rate}} of 13 percent through 2010, when figures are expected to top $ 3. 7 billion. Driving this expansion is the tremendous need for companies to shorten time to market, lower costs, improve performance and develop steady streams of knock-out, innovative products. With survival on the line in many cases, manufacturers use simulation as a proven way of addressing these issues. According to Daratech statistics, the number-one player in CAE is ANSYS, Inc.

40|$|It is now commonplace to {{hear the}} LGBT rights {{movement}} being described as the last, or the next, or today’s, pre-eminent civil rights issue. This chapter will explore what that means from several perspectives: What does the label {{tell us about the}} civil rights paradigm itself? If the achievement of marriage equality is the great civil rights achievement of this generation, what does that suggest about a future for equality more generally? How have new forms of, and technologies for, movement building affected the idea and practice of civil rights? Does the civil rights paradigm have a future? I focus in on three aspects of the social meaning of civil rights: legal doctrine and legal institutions, social movement strategies, and the tension between the discourse of challenges to social hierarchy and that of civil rights. What we learn is that LGBT advocates have contributed to the overall project of formal equality under law primarily by developing an extraordinary strategic and tactical dexterity, uniquely so at the state level and in its alliance with the business sector. As to the latter, however, there are serious potential disadvantages. In the current political framework, the possibility of advances in substantive equality law-–either statutory or Constitutional-–has shrunken to the point that, even as LGBT rights groups make breakthroughs in achieving goals such as marriage equality, they will do well to avoid having to take backward steps with regard to such overarching concepts as the disparate impact principle or heightened scrutiny.

Lack of knowledge about cultural notions sometimes leads to drastic breakdowns. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> the teacher at this point is how best a teacher can approach teaching culture. What can I do as a teacher to help make the target culture real for my students? EFL practitioners have highlighted the role of collaboration, focusing on the meaning-making use of language, loosening teacher control, and creating desirable setting for learners. The workshop that is described here proposes the potential of using videos as a vehicle for promoting cultural knowledge. Firstly, in so doing the significance of teaching culture in an EFL curriculum is highlighted. Secondly, the views on the use of teaching aids – here video – are briefly reviewed. Finally and most importantly, while introducing different tips, the researcher will suggest ways to encourage teaching culture. Why Culture? Prior to the 1960 s, the line between language and culture was carefully drawn. People learned a second or foreign language in order to read and study its literature.

40|$|IT HAS NOW {{been two}} years since the US {{invasion}} of Iraq that brought about the downfall of Saddam Hussein and his regime. Not surprisingly, its wider strategic effects still are being felt today, both politically at a global and regional level and militarily {{on the ground in}} Iraq - all of which will continue to have a considerable impact on Australia. On the broader political level {{much has been made of}} the charm offensive being headed by US President George W. Bush and his Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in their attempts to mend relations with European allies. But given that this is a US Administration that doesn’t admit to making mistakes - let alone believing it has done so - it all seems to be more of a change in public relations strategy than any real change in policy. With respect to the wider Middle East region, a number of commentators have interpreted recent political developments in that area - especially in Lebanon - as proving the invasion of Iraq was justified, in that it ushered in a wave of democratic sentiment across the region. Ignoring the fact that Lebanon never figured at all in any US strategic thinking before the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, the same commentators were deathly silent when 500, 000 supporters of Hezbollah took to the streets of Beirut to support the Syrian military presence. It seems that according to these commentators democracy is only evident when it supports the aims and policies of the US government. So before we get too cocky about what’s currently happening we need to remember that democracy is a two-way street. The fact remains that spreading democracy throughout the Middle East, while a worthy cause, will not automatically make that region a safer place. It could deliver exactly the opposite result, especially if and when al Qaeda and its fellow travellers realise that a democratic Middle East represents far more of an opportunity for them than it does a threat. Some two years after the fall of Saddam, Iraqis certainly are closer to getting their own fully sovereign and somewhat representative government, but are even further away from peace, security and stability. The next nine months are going to be fairly critical. A referendum on a draft constitution is expected mid-October and elections for a new government based on that constitution are expected mid December. The key to containing the insurgency is to bring the Sunni population back into the political process. The key for the insurgents isn’t necessarily to disrupt that entire election process, all they need to do is ensure the Sunnis - who remain the lifeblood of the insurgency - remain disenfranchised from the future of Iraq. So the next nine months may yet prove to be the most violent in Iraq’s recent history. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> Australia in all of this is whether we’ll be expected to supply even more troops to help stabilise Iraq and secure its future. We certainly have the capability to deploy at least a battalion group of some 1200 personnel in Iraq (which means doubling our presence in Iraq) without jeopardising our ability to respond to unforeseen contingencies in our own immediate region. A deployment of this size certainly would be more in tune with the government’s rhetoric about how important the future of Iraq is to Australia’s security. But whether we do boost our troop numbers ultimately depends on the security situation on the ground in Iraq. Recent events in Iraq would seem to prove that what’s ‘relatively benign’ one day can become a war zone the next. So if the security environment in the Al Muthanna province deteriorates the Australian government seriously will have to consider bolstering our existing troops with extra personnel and capability, just as the Dutch had to do before us. The other issue that affects our troop numbers is the military presence and commitment of other coalition allies. The Italians have been careful to tie their recently announced troop withdrawal to the ability of Iraqi forces to take over security responsibilities in their area. So in theory they shouldn’t need other coalition troops to fill the gap; rather, the Italians eventually will be replaced by Iraqi security forces. The problem is the only way really to judge the abilities of Iraqi troops to do so is when the security situation does deteriorate. But when that happens the Italians may already have left which means it will be left to the coalition countries remaining in Iraq to fill the gap. • Aldo Borgu is a military analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

40|$|Over {{the last}} centuries, the being of {{intuitive}} knowledge and its meaning have been conflicted by Plato’s interpreters. Some interpreters have not accepted such knowledge at all, {{but the real}} conflict is between those who accept that knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> challenging <b>question,</b> <b>for</b> them, is {{that if they are}} rational or mystic. In this paper, we tried to show that knowledge in Plato’s viewpoint is not only intellectual, but beyond, it also implies an intellectual vision. Because, for Plato, on the one hand, intellectual perception of things means perception of common characters of them which they are represented in the form of judgments and propositions. On the other hand, if the explanation of everything is through the Reason and Ideas, and the explanation of the Ideas themselves is through the agent and final cause of the Good, hence there will not be such an explanation about the Good itself, because it is a Good and Beautiful in itself. Then its knowledge is beyond intellectual perception in the form of conceptual and general judgments. Instead, it will be direct knowledge, and a vision that cannot be expressed in the form of proposition. This intuition although is a sudden and short knowledge; but according to Plato, it is stable and definite, and is based on a dialectical process. We cannot say and write anything about its object; but we can only experience it with the help of leader and by a direct illumination. It belongs to philosopher, not anybody; because it is only philosopher who can turn his soul thoroughly to be obedient to Intellect- that is the same part of soul which is kinsman of Ideas- and, in conclusion, as deserving of such a knowledge. ...|$|R
40|$|DARK ENERGY, ANISOTROPY, LOWER DIMENSIONS AND THE HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE Most recent {{large scale}} {{observations}} of the universe allow inferring that, {{in the context of}} cosmology derived from the general theory of relativity, over 90 % of the universe is made up of invisible matter and energy. A milestone in this development occurred in 1998, when teams of the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High Redshift Supernova Project suggested that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating. This acceleration has so far been confirmed through diverse independent sources: measurements of the cosmic bottom of microwave, gravitational lenses, original nucleosynthesis of light elements and the large-scale structure of the universe. This acceleration is a relatively new phenomenon; that is, when galaxies were being formed the expansion would slow down because density of the matter was higher than the almost constant density that dark matter has maintained. About 4, 000 million years ago, density of the dark matter exceeded density of the matter of the universe, which is constantly decreasing as the universe is expanding, and the effect of negative pressure led to an acceleration of the expansion. What is the nature of this dark matter and how does it evolve as cosmic time goes by? This is one of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> modern physics, given that a deeper understanding of it could even lead to a theory that unifies the concepts of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics. The first approximation to the idea that there might be an invisible form of energy filling up the universe was introduced by Einstein in 1917 under the name of cosmological constant. If this constant features a positive symbol, acts as a fluid with negative pressure; that is, produces large-scale repellent effects. This is the oldest model for what is called dark energy. This project studied cosmological models were dark energy is modelled not as a constant density of energy but as a negative pressure fluid ruled by an equation of state that precisely relates pressure and density of the fluid. Additionally, the presence of dispersive effects during evolution of this energy has been considered. Results obtained show that it is possible to obtain solutions that translate into singularities in the future; that is, moments in which acceleration of the universe, for example, becomes infinite. This is what has been called the “phantom menace”. In this scenario, the structures of the universe would start to move away from each other with an exponentially growing acceleration and later the same components of these structures (galaxies, stars) would end up disintegrating. The ultimate fate is a big torn-apart of time and space (Big Rip) that will destroy the universe in about 20, 000 million year in the future Observations at a cosmological level do not rule out that dark energy may potentially have this “phantom” behaviour. One of the principles that have been used as a guide for obtaining a consistent formulation of a theory that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics has been the Holographic Principle. This principle, inspired in the proportionally between the horizon of events of a black hole and its entropy, established that all degrees of freedom of a region in space are the same as binary freedom degrees distributed in the surroundings of that region. Based on these holographic criteria, it has been possible, for example, to predict a value for density of dark matter that is similar to that obtained by cosmological observations Research conducted under this project, in the framework of the holographic principle, have enabled a better approximation to the “cosmic coincidence” issue; that is, why densities of dark matter and dark energy are comparable in the present times.

40|$|The {{external}} {{environment has}} deteriorated sharply {{as a result}} of the spiraling financial turmoil, and has led to a weakening in commodity prices and fears of a worldwide recession. Latin America and the Caribbean's fastest expansion in 40 years may be threatened as the global credit crunch makes financing scarce and squeezes demand for the region's commodities. This time around the region is better positioned to weather the crisis than in the past, given improvements in macroeconomic and financial policies as well as a reduced net dependency on external capital inflows. However, Latin American markets are feeling the effects of the crisis through a slowdown in capital inflows, large declines in stock price indexes, significant currency adjustments and an increase in debt spreads. Volatility has soared, with the closely watched Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index moving to an all-time high of 70. 33 on October 17, indicating that fear (rather than greed) has been ruling the markets. After reaching record lows in May 2007, emerging markets bond spreads are now above pre-Asian crisis levels. The JPMorgan EMBI+ Latin American composite widened by 146 basis points in the third quarter, with spreads reaching 448 basis points at the end of September. Spreads have widened sharply in recent weeks as foreign investors cut back regional exposure for the safety of U. S. Treasuries. The ongoing lack of liquidity and subsequent liquidation of assets is leading to a collapse in asset prices and a sharp widening in spreads. Daily spreads in October have risen to levels not seen since December 2002, making it much more difficult for governments that need financing to get it. Risk premiums for Latin corporates and sovereigns have risen substantially, but have remained well below U. S. junk (high-yield) bonds. Latin corporates are facing a steep rise in foreign exchange borrowing costs (although less than firms in other emerging markets), which raises concerns that refinancing risks will climb. So far, emerging markets vulnerabilities have been more focused on corporates, as sovereigns have improved public debt dynamics and countries' financing needs are under control. Market performance has been driven by the rapid deterioration of emerging markets bank and corporate market, as well as ongoing losses in emerging markets equities. From January to September 2008, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Latin American Index lost almost 28 %, while the Emerging Markets Index lost 37 % and the G- 7 Index lost 24 %. While in 2007 the Latin America component gained 47 %, almost nine times as much as the MSCI-G 7 index for developed markets, since mid-September 2008 stocks in Latin America have been doing worse than stocks in developed countries, as concerns about access to credit and the adverse impact of sharp falls in commodity prices and in local currencies contribute to increased risk aversion and to outflows of capital. Many governments in the region have used revenue from the commodity boom to pay down debt and build reserves. Now, facing a global financial crisis and the threat of recession in developed countries, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> Latin America is how long and deep this cyclical downturn will be, and how much it is going to reduce commodity prices. Prices for commodities such as soy, gold, copper and oil, which helped fund the region's boom, have fallen 28 % since their July 2 high, according to the RJ/CRB Commodity Price Index. According to Morgan Stanley (in a September 29 report), should prices return to their 10 -year average, Latin America's balanced budgets would quickly revert to a deficit of 4. 1 % of GDP. As risk aversion increases, investors are rapidly pulling out massive amounts of money, creating problems for local markets and banks. There is an ongoing shortage of dollars (as investors liquidate assets in Latin American markets), and as currencies depreciate, inflation concerns increase despite the global slowdown. In Brazil and Mexico, central banks deployed billions of dollars of reserves to stem steep currency declines, as companies in these countries, believing their local currencies would continue to strengthen against the U. S. dollar, took debts in dollars. Some companies also made bets using currency derivatives that have led to losses in the billions of dollars. Dramatic currency swings have caused heavy losses for many companies, from Mexico's cement giant Cemex SAB to the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Votorantim. Mexico's third-largest retailer, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, declared bankruptcy recently after reporting huge losses related to exchange rate bets. As concerns about corporate exposure to dollar-denominated derivatives increases, yields on bonds issued by many of Brazil's and Mexico's leading companies have started to rise, sharply raising the cost of issuing new debt. Latin American external debt issuance came to a halt in the third quarter of 2008, totaling only US$ 690 million. The cost of obtaining loans for capital expenditures, M&A and debt refinancing is also rising substantially for Latin American corporates amid contagion from the U. S. financial crisis. According to bankers, a protracted trend of shortening tenors and widening spreads has intensified in the past few weeks, indicating that bank lending is quickly following the way of bonds and equity. Finally, money transfers from Latin American migrants are expected to decline for the first time this decade, {{as a result of}} economic downturns in the U. S. and Spain, inflation and a weaker dollar. The Mexican Central Bank announced that money transfers from Mexicans living in the U. S. dropped a record 12. 2 % in August. In 2008, migrants from the region will send some 1. 7 % less in remittances year-on-year when adjusted for inflation, according to the IADB, compounding the adverse effects of the deepening financial turmoil...|$|R
40|$|Energy network {{infrastructures}} form {{an integral}} part of continuous, stable and uninterrupted energy supply and transmission. These structures are complex and mostly consist of wired or pipeline networks. Some examples of these networked infrastructures can be oil and natural gas lines, electricity (grids), heat pipelines, biogas and green gas lines, Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions capture and distribution etc. These energy infrastructures primarily transport energy from their entries (sources) to exits (sinks). Modern industrialized societies perception of demand for energy is seeing a dynamic change. When energy transport distribution using existing networks becomes insufficient, then topology extensions come into play or the need for new infrastructures is demanded. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> the network planners is to identify the positions where these extensions are to be placed, keeping the total extension costs to the minimum. Moreover, in case of rolling out new networks in areas where population density is high and with their associated technical complexity, demand for proper planning techniques to design the network layouts is increasing. On the other hand, many scientific researchers have proposed different types of network optimization algorithms for routing in energy network planning from a system perspective. Models have been developed to simulate the networked infrastructures using several optimization techniques to provide cost efficient networks. Although these scientific models are proposed, either they are not well known or they are too complex for the network planners to use them in decision making for real world cases. These concerns led to the motivation of this research. In simple terms, {{there is a need to}} bridge the gap between the scientific knowledge and practical decision making for designing efficient energy networks. The research question for analyzing this situation is formulated as, “In what ways can the scientific approaches for energy network design be enhanced to ensure their usability among decision makers?” To answer the research question, the energy network of biogas and upgraded biogas (greengas) in Netherlands was chosen for this study. The first phase started with an empirical study of the biogas energy network from a Socio-Technical (ST) perspective. This perspective was chosen to understand the network characteristics of the supply chain of biogas production and distribution. Literature study and interviews with experts were conducted to understand the technical aspects, the key stakeholders involved in the network planning and the institutional directives that drive the network design. From the ST study the main factors that can influence the network design, their inter-relations and the interests of the stakeholders were clearly identified. After gaining a system perspective of the biogas/ green gas network the various scientific approaches proposing different optimization techniques for network planning were studied closely. The advantages, limitations and the assumptions of these techniques were carefully studied to understand why they are not used for real world cases so far. After the empirical study, in the conceptualization phase, the factors needed for network design from the ST perspective were base-lined keeping in mind the various stakeholder interests, especially the needs of the network planners. Based on this understanding a design approach was proposed to adapt existing scientific models with the factors obtained from the ST study. In the synthesis phase, the base-lined user requirements of decision makers and the working principles of the adapted algorithms, were combined and a user friendly interface design was proposed. This User Interface (UI) aids decision making for network planners and can be regarded as a Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS is proposed as a software application in the form of use cases, sequence diagram and screen layouts. The DSS incorporates the actual requirements of the decision makers and combines it with the adapted scientific approaches of network planning and optimization, bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and practical decision making. Research Findings and Recommendations The heterogeneity of different energy networks, network characteristics and the different actors involved makes the notion of decision making as “one size fits all” less suitable. The different technical components, energy characteristics and the network equipment are specific to each energy network and they need to be separately considered while planning a network design. The empirical study of the socio technical analysis for biogas energy networks and the study of the scientific optimization methods, have been successful in drafting the characteristics of biogas networks which are important for network planning. A pipeline transporting gas over long distance has larger diameter and has compressor stations spread in the area to maintain the operating pressure of the gas in the pipeline. The article 12 b of the Dutch Gas Act governs the rules for gas transmission and distribution in NL. The network facilitators are obliged to connect the gas producers to the grid if they meet the gas quality and grid specifications. In climate sensitive areas, the demand for gas can be low in summer and can be very high in winter. Gas storage's and flexible production units are introduced to balance the demand of gas against supply depending on the specific region and the operating pressure of the pipeline. The desired specifications of these technical components may influence the building costs of network design and have to be considered while designing solutions for network optimization. The non-overlapping factors from the ST study like the passive pipe profile and the active controllable components like compressor station, valves etc. need to be considered by researchers while creating scientific models. A design approach is proposed to enhance the functionality of the existing models through newer cost equations and decision making logic. The sociological study concludes that the main stakeholders display network characteristics of variety, inter dependencies and closeness. All of them share different goals and interests and want to maximize their interest. Using the scientific models directly is still very complex for them. Thus, there is a need for increased collaboration among different stakeholders and a transparent system where all of them can come together and make decisions in the interest of all. The proposed decision support system combines the realistic requirements of the decision makers, simulates a real environment of an energy network and also inherits the benefits of the adapted scientific approaches. Although this is not the scope of this research, mentioning it will boost biogas production in NL. From a policy perspective, Government needs to increase the depreciation period of subsidies for biogas production and also regulate the biogas market. This move can ensure more production and also safety and reliability of the grid. Stakeholder collaboration is also seen as an important aspect and there is a need for conducting Constructive Technology Assessment of biogas through scenario workshops. These moves will bring the different stakeholders together, reduce uncertainty and decisions can be taken in the interest of all.
