25|$|Despite {{the immense}} {{success of the}} Reliance, she was used only one season, her design and {{maintenance}} keeping her from being used for any other purpose than for a cup defense. The extremity of both 1903 cup contenders encouraged Nathanael Herreshoff to make boats more wholesome and durable by devising a new rule. Proposing {{in the same year}} the Universal Rule, he added the elements of overall length and displacement into the rating, to the benefit of heavy, voluminous hulls and also divided boats into classes, without handicapping sail area. This went against the American Yacht Clubs' and the British Yacht Racing Association's general desire to promote speed at all costs for cup boats, but the NYYC adopted Herreshoff's proposal. Lipton long pleaded for a smaller size of yachts in the new rule, and the NYYC conceded to seventy-five footers in 1914. Lipton turned to Charles Ernest Nicholson for his fourth challenge, and got a superb design under the inauspicious shape of Shamrock IV, with a flat transom. She was the most powerful yacht that year, and the NYYC turned out three cup candidates to defend the cup: of George Owen's Defiance and William Gardner's Vanitie, it was Herreshoff who designed the wisest of all contenders. His last design for the cup, the Resolute, was small, which earned significant <b>time</b> <b>allowance</b> over other yachts. Barr had died, but his crew manned the Resolute, which faced stiff competition from Vanitie, but {{went on to win the}} selection trials, before the Cup was suspended as World War I broke out.|$|E

CR 3 BP equations were used to generate two-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds. Optimized trajectory solutions were found using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation applied to the third body traveling from L 1 toward m 2. Three sets of optimal trajectories with various fixed final positions were compared to the L 1 manifold. The cases with final positions closest to the manifold remained close and had lower costs. Trajectories with low <b>time</b> <b>allowances</b> took more direct paths to their final positions, leaving the manifold and resulting in higher costs. Large <b>time</b> <b>allowances</b> caused increased trajectory length and early departure from the manifold, resulting in increased cost. For the intermediate time constrained cases, the trajectories stay longer on the manifold and cost less. From this investigation, optimized trajectories were shown to use manifolds when finding the optimal trajectory in the CR 3 BP...|$|R

2500|$|Jumper {{classes are}} held over {{a course of}} show jumping obstacles, {{including}} verticals, spreads, and double and triple combinations, usually with many turns and changes of direction. The intent is to jump cleanly over a set course within an allotted time. Time faults are assessed for exceeding the <b>time</b> <b>allowance.</b> Jumping faults are incurred for knockdowns and blatant disobedience, such as refusals (when the horse stops before a fence or [...] "runs out") (see [...] "Modern rules" [...] below). Horses are allowed {{a limited number of}} refusals before being disqualified. A refusal may lead to a rider exceeding the time allowed on course. Placings are based on the lowest number of points or [...] "faults" [...] accumulated. A horse and rider who have not accumulated any jumping faults or penalty points are said to have scored a [...] "clear round". Tied entries usually have a jump-off over a raised and shortened course, and the course is timed; if entries are tied for faults accumulated in the jump-off, the fastest time wins.|$|E

To simplify the bureaucratic process and [...] "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter. In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles. Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban. In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its <b>time</b> <b>allowance</b> and providing a cash bonus to parents.

Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} distribution-free models that solve the {{appointment}} sequencing and scheduling problems by assuming only moments information of job durations. We show that our min-max appointment scheduling models, which minimize the worst-case expected waiting and overtime costs {{out of all}} probability distributions with the given marginal moments, can be exactly formulated as tractable conic programs. These formulations are obtained by exploiting hidden convexity of the problem. In the special case where only the first two marginal moments are given, the problem can be reformulated as a second-order cone program. Based on the structural properties of this formulation, under a mild condition, we derive the optimal <b>time</b> <b>allowances</b> in closed form and prove that it is optimal to sequence jobs in increasing order of job duration variance.

2500|$|Shamrock IV {{was never}} raced again, but the {{universal}} rule drew significant appeal, {{especially in the}} small M-Class. Believing that the new rule offered a serious opportunity for the British to take the Cup, Lipton challenged for the fifth and last time at age 79, in 1929. The J-Class was chosen for the contest, to which were added Lloyds' A1 scantling rules {{in order to ensure}} that the yachts would be seaworthy and evenly matched, given the Deed of Gift requirement for yachts to sail to the match on their [...] "own bottom." [...] The waterline length was set between [...] and , and there would be no <b>time</b> <b>allowance.</b> Novel rigging technology now permitted the Bermuda rig to replace the gaff rig. Nicholson was chosen to design challenger Shamrock V, and despite the Wall Street Crash, four NYYC syndicates responded to the threat and built a cup contender each. The venue was moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where, the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company's new naval architect Starling Burgess used his success in the M-Class and his experience as a wartime plane designer to build the Vanderbilt syndicate's defender Enterprise, the smallest J-Class. Meanwhile, Herreshoff's son, Lewis Francis Herreshoff, designed a radical boat: The Whirlwind, despite being the most advanced boat with her double-ended [...] "canoe" [...] build and electronic instruments, maneuvered too clumsily. The old 75-footers Resolute and Vanitie were rebuilt and converted to the J-Class to serve as trial horses. The Enterprises skipper Harold Vanderbilt won the selection trials with great difficulty. When Shamrock V was revealed, she was an outdated wooden boat with a wooden mast and performed poorly to windward. Enterprise was then fitted with the World's first duralumin mast, very lightweight at , and beat her opponent soundly.|$|E

The core idea is to achieve more volume flexibility in the production system by exploiting favourable product and market characteristics (high demand predictability, long customer order lead <b>time</b> <b>allowances</b> and low product perishability). A case study is used to demonstrate how the framework can enable food producers to achieve efficiency in production, inventory and PPC processes – and simultaneously be responsive to market requirements...|$|R

Statistical analysis revealed that: (1) male wombats were more prone to stereotypic behaviour than females and (2) the amount of time a wombat spent feeding per day had an influence on stereotypic expression.
