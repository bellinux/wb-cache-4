30|$|Equal {{number of}} {{comparator}} implants (size 3.5  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm) were {{inserted in the}} other tibia/femur head of the animals after doing the osteotomy according to the manufacturer’s protocol as follows. After mobilizing the mucoperiosteal flap, the 3 -mm center punch was used to register a guide for the twist drill. The twist drill was used to establish the axial alignment of the implant and {{to assist in the}} guidance of the depth drill. The depth drills were sequentially used to create osteotomy to the subcrestal axial depth of 0.5  mm. The conical reamer was used to develop the conical shape of the implant body and to check the osteotomy depth. A counter-clockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in soft bone. The tap or <b>thread</b> <b>cutter</b> was used for dense bone to create the threads in the osteotomy. The thread cutter’s diameter corresponds to the implant diameter. To engage the implant into the implant placement tool, the square faces on the implant fixture mount were aligned with those on the implant placement tool, then pushed together. Using the handle (finger wheel), the implant was pulled out of inner vial and the plastic collar was discarded. The implant placement assembly was transferred to the osteotomy and the implant was secured into the osteotomy site. The implant placement was started with the handle and finally placed using the hand-ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was rinsed out and the depth was checked by retapping. To disengage fixture mount from implant, the open-ended spanner was used to break the retention force of the fixture mount retention screw. The knurled top of the implant placement tool was turned by hand to fully disengage the fixture mount with the implant. Pushing down on the knurled top of the implant placement tool disengaged the fixture mount.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} to increase the proportion of thread milling operations, among other ways of tapping, which is associated with increasing number of CNC machines, flexibility and versatility of the process. Developments presently existing in the RF and used in the thread mills deal, mainly, with the thread milling cutter designs, to process internal and external thread with straight flutes made from high-speed steel. The paper presents a technique to calculate and select the initial design parameters, i. e. the external diameter of the tapping part of thread milling cutter, which is chosen as a basic computational design.   The analysis of directories of tool companies containing foreign de-signs of solid thread end-milling cutters has shown that most of them rep-resent the <b>thread</b> <b>cutter</b> designs made of solid carbide. There are solid and interlocking side milling cutters, which use a tapping part both as a single-disk and as a multi-disk one; chip flutes are made to be both as direct and as screw; solid designs of cutters are made from carbide with a diameter of up to 20 [...] . 25 mm; thread cutters can be left- and right-hand cutting; Designs of the combined thread mills are proposed; internal channels are used for coolant supply. It is shown that the purpose of the external diameter of the tapping part of the thread mill should take into account the effect of the thread mill diameter on the milling process performance, precision of thread profile received, taper thread, tool strength, and the volume of flutes. The analysis has shown that when choosing the external diameter of the thread mill it worth taking its maximum diameter to improve the char-acteristics of the process under the restrictions imposed on the accuracy of the formed thread. </p...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> with helical flutes. Since the standard presents <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters</b> {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters,</b> made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutter</b> shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutter,</b> made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development. Dependences are obtained for the model with a variation of the five factors (external diameter d, step profiles, P, rake γтц, clearance α, inclination angle of helical flutes ω) for <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutters,</b> made of cemented carbide and according to the model that extends the range of variation factors (d, P, γтц, ω) according to GOST 1336 - 77. Thus, this model to have the angles of the tooth profile of <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes can be used both to obtain the angles profile β 1 and β 2 {{in a wide range of}} varying tool parameters for all types of tool materials, and to broaden the possibilities for calculation of parameters according to GOST 1336 - 77. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThread milling {{has become}} quite popular {{in recent years}} as an {{alternative}} to tapping or other forms of threading because of diversity and complexity of parts and flexibility of the process in industries such as biomedical applications, aerospace and die-mold manufacturing. Today the design of the tooth profile is, however, predominantly feasible by the expertise and “trial and error” principle. Presented in this paper are a novel methodology to design the tooth profile of the thread mill by comparing the “to-be” thread profile and the “as-is” thread profile which is analyzed by means of NC cutting simulation. The simulation kernel enables to continually subtract the swept volume of <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutter</b> undergoing helical movement from the workpiece and to calculate the virtual workpiece (VWP). Combined with the standardized “to-be” thread profile, the tooth profile of to-be-designed thread mill is adaptively modified until the thread profile on VWP and the “to-be” thread profile become congruent with each other. The proposed methodology could be integrated into CAD/CAM systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{mechanistic}} cutting {{forces for}} thread milling of the ISO {{metric screw thread}} are predicted. The force model is composed of surface and edge force components. The cutting edge is modelled from the geometry of the milling cutter, including the helix angle and thread tooth profile. To determine the specific cutting force coefficients for surface and edge force components, the cutting forces are measured with a dynamometer along a horizontal linear path and compared with the calculated force {{by means of the}} exact uncut chip thickness which results from the modelling of chip volume per tooth at a prescribed time on the <b>thread</b> milling <b>cutter.</b> The run-out errors are considered to estimate the uneven cutting force distribution for each tooth. The measured cutting forces for the brass workpiece material (CuZn 37) for a linear path shows quite good agreement with the simulated cutting forces. The results indicate that the proposed cutting force model for thread milling can be used in order to adapt cutting parameters, such as feed per tooth and axial depth of cut for the purpose of increasing productivity in practical application...|$|R
