50|$|Liberia is a source, transit, and {{destination}} country for children trafficked for forced labor and sexual exploitation. Most victims are trafficked within the country, primarily {{from rural areas}} to urban areas for domestic servitude, forced street vending, and sexual exploitation.

A January 2008 United Nations (UN) report indicates, however, that such abuses by UN personnel have declined since the previous year. There have been reports that children are trafficked to Liberia from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Côte d'Ivoire and from Liberia to Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Nigeria for domestic servitude, street vending, sexual exploitation, and agricultural labor.

Comments on the start-up costs draft should be despatched so as to be received no later than 2 May. All comments will be regarded as on the public record unless confidentiality is requested by the commentator. Application of the <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> in FRS 15 A question has been raised on the interaction between paragraph 106 (reassessment of asset lives/residual values) and paragraph 108 (adoption of component accounting) in the <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> applicable when FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets ’ is first adopted. The UITF decided that the prior period adjustment required by paragraph 108 should be restricted to the effects of treating different components of an asset separately and should not embrace any changes to the useful economic lives or residual values of the other components of the asset. The proposed Abstract specifies the limit to any such prior year adjustment. Start-up costs The UITF has considered whether start-up costs that cannot be included in the cost of a fixed asset under the relevant standards (FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’, FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets ’ and SSAP 13 ‘Accounting for research and development’) may nevertheless be carried forward, for example as a prepayment or as deferred expenditure. The UITF concluded that start-up costs that do not meet the criteria for recognition as fixed assets set out in the standards referred to above should be recognised as an expense when they are incurred. The UITF noted that this conclusion is consistent with both International and US Standards. The conclusions on both these topics, and the UITF’s reasons for them, are explained in the draft Abstracts...|$|E
40|$|Sweden did {{not apply}} any <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> for {{migrants}} coming from the ten new European Union member states in May 2004. The migration to Sweden from these countries also increased, especially from Poland and the Baltic states, even if not {{to the same extent}} as the immigration to Ireland and the UK (two countries with transitory rules of minor importance). The composition of the migrants changed. While earlier many more women than men arrived, now the gender composition is much more even. In this paper the labour market situation is studied for people living in Sweden at the end of 2005 who were either born in one of new member states or born in Sweden. The immigrants are represented in all sectors of the economy but overrepresented in some sectors. Their wages controlling for education are somewhat lower than those for natives. The labour market situation is rather good for the new immigrants and they are not overrepresented in different income transfer programs. The knowledge of these conditions may explain that Sweden abstained from introducing <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> also when Bulgaria and Romania became members of the European Union in January 2007...|$|E
50|$|The first {{election}} for the People's National Assembly {{was held on}} 20 September 1962. In 1963, the President of the Republic of Algeria, Ahmed Ben Bella, halted {{the activities of the}} APN and set up a Revolution Council lasting from 1965 to 1976. The APN was reestablished in 1976 with the passage of Algeria's new constitution, at the time only a unicameral legislature. Up until 1991, the ruling party was the National Liberation Front (FLN), and in fact, the 1976 Algerian constitution considered the FLN as the preferred Algerian political party. The first APN election with multiple parties was held in December 1991. After a predicted Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) victory, a fundamentalist opposition party, the Algerian People's National Armed Forces canceled the elections. A substitute legislative body, the National Consultative Council, was established in April 1992 and lasted until May 1994, when the National <b>Transitional</b> Council <b>ruled</b> for until the next elections, held on 5 June 1997. In 1996, the legislature split into two chambers forming the Algerian Parliament with the ratification of a new constitution.|$|R

His son, Kim Jong-il, who had already assumed key {{positions}} in the government, succeeded as General Secretary of the Korean Workers' Party. At that time, North Korea had no secretary-general in the party nor a president. What minimal legal procedure had been established was summarily ignored. Although a new constitution appeared to end the wartime political system, it did not completely terminate the <b>transitional</b> military <b>rule.</b> Rather it legitimized and institutionalized military rule by making the National Defense Commission (NDC) the most important state organization and its chairman the highest authority. After three years of consolidating his power, Kim Jong-il became Chairman of the NDC on October 8, 1997, a position described by the NDC as the nation's [...] "highest administrative authority", and thus North Korea's de facto head of state. His succession had been foreshadowed in 1980, when he was introduced to the public at the Sixth Party Congress. In 1982, Kim Jong-il had established himself as a leading theoretician with the publication of On the Juche Idea. In 1984, he had been officially confirmed as his father's successor.|$|R

40|$|Ecological {{assessment}} of wetland environments requires {{the use of}} computational tools that would allow the integration of ecological features and water flow. Such is the case of eco-hydraulic models which can be used to generate valuable information and study different scenarios in wetland systems. In the case of the Macquarie Marshes, semi-arid Australia, vegetation species are highly dependent of inundation times, frequency of inundation, water depths and timing. Regulations of the past few decades have modified the hydraulic regimes of the site and which led to a detriment of the plant communities. The development of an eco-hydraulic model that integrates the dynamic of the vegetation and water regimes {{requires the use of}} <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> that link flow regime characteristics to plant status. This research intends for a description of the change in the status of plant communities of the Macquarie Marshes and to link these changes with time aggregated characteristics of the flow regime. We make use of a quasi- 2 D hydrodynamic model in order to determine flood patterns within the site. This model has previously been implemented for the Macquarie Marshes revealing a good performance level. Quarterly vegetation maps for different years will be analyzed against the description of the hydraulic regime. Obtaining these relations will aid the current development of an eco-hydraulic model for the site by providing relations that can be used as <b>transitional</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|E
