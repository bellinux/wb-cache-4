50|$|Infants chew on {{objects to}} aid in the {{teething}} process. This can be dangerous if the baby is allowed to chew on objects which are small enough to be swallowed or which could break while being chewed and cause choking. <b>Teething</b> <b>rings</b> and other toys, called teethers, are often designed with textures that will appeal to an infant during teething. Drawing water into a pacifier and freezing it as another way to offer a teething child relief. The cold pressure on the gums gives relief without making the child’s fingers cold.|$|R
5000|$|Pacifiers were a {{development}} of hard <b>teething</b> <b>rings,</b> {{but they were}} also a substitute for the softer sugar tits, sugar-teats or sugar-rags which had been in use in 19th century America. A writer in 1873 described a [...] "sugar-teat" [...] made from [...] "a small piece of old linen" [...] with a [...] "spoonful of rather sandy sugar in the center of it", [...] "gathered ... up into a little ball" [...] with a thread tied tightly around it. Rags with foodstuffs tied inside were also given to babies in many parts of Northern Europe and elsewhere. In some places a lump of meat or fat was tied in cloth, and sometimes the rag was moistened with brandy. German-speaking areas might use Lutschbeutel, cloth wrapped around sweetened bread or maybe poppy-seeds. A Madonna and child painted by Dürer in 1506 shows one of these tied-cloth [...] "pacifiers" [...] in the baby's hand.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Parents are {{increasingly}} searching the Internet {{to gather information}} about their children&# 8217;s health care. This study compared infant teething information obtained from publically employed pediatricians in Istanbul with that obtained from different Turkish websites (parenting, health, professional, news and commercial). METHODS: This study had two parts. The first part used a descriptive design, with two checklists to assess the quality and comprehensiveness of the teething-specific content on 62 parenting or health websites. The second part was a cross-sectional study of 75 pediatricians at public hospitals who completed a structured self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 54 websites (87. 1 %) described infant teething as a normal developmental process. The lists that {{were found on the}} websites identified the most frequent signs of infant teething as fever and drooling/perioral rash. The most frequent management strategies were chewing non-chilled and chilled objects. For teething problems, some pediatricians recommended <b>teething</b> <b>rings</b> and oral benzocaine, while 23 pediatricians recommended nothing. CONCLUSIONS: Parents should be informed by health professionals, especially regarding specific treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{signs and}} symptoms related to eruption, understand the occurrence of these alterations, and finally, identify the frequency and intensity of their appearance. Method: Questionnaires and surveys were conducted with 100 parents or legal guardians of {{children between the ages}} of six months and five years of age, and also with 100 pediatricians in the city of Fortaleza. The factors researched were the incidence of {{signs and symptoms}} during dental eruption, aiming to discover which were most common, which methods of treatment were used and other aspects related to the quality of information received by the mothers. Results: Of the pediatricians interviewed, 93. 9 % reported clinical alterations in their patients during dental eruption. The manifestations most commonly found were, in a decreasing order of frequency, irritability, the habit of taking the hand to the mouth, syalorrhea, anorexia, fever, fitful sleep and diarrhea. A great number of mothers reported visiting a doctor upon occurrence of these alterations, and also using <b>teething</b> <b>rings</b> and ointments. The pediatricians, for the most part, reported giving exclusive orientation as a treatment option, and, in some cases, prescribing symptomatic medication. A small part of these professionals referred the patient to a dentist. The mothers reported having received minimum information with regards to dental eruption during the pre-natal period and showed a low level of satisfaction with the information received. Conclusion: The vast majority of the pediatricians and caregivers demonstrated the presence of systemic oral manifestations. Irritability was reported in a higher percentage, followed by the habit of hand-to-mouth, excessive salivation, anorexia, fever, disturbance in the sleep and diarrhea...|$|R
40|$|Thousands of children’s toys {{have been}} {{recalled}} recently because of lead paint. But lead {{is not the}} only worry. Many other chemicals used in children’s products also pose health risks. Two of these are bisphenol A and phthalates. Both chemicals disrupt hormones in the human body. Children are more vulnerable Child development is a delicate biological process, guided in part by the body’s own hormones acting at exquisitely low levels and affecting every cell, organ and function of the human body. Exposures to chemicals like phthalates and bisphenol- A during critical times in development can disrupt this delicate process, resulting in life long health impacts. Healthy people, a clean environment and a thriving economy Body Burden Hundreds of unwanted synthetic chemicals are present in the human body. They pass from mother to baby and are found in umbilical cord blood, as well as breast milk. They build up with the potential for long term health impacts. BPA is found in the bodies of over 95 % of Americans (children have the highest levels) and phthalates have been found in 100 % of the population tested. These chemicals do not belong in our children’s toys and they definitely do not belong in our bodies. Ph t h a l a t e s (pronounced thal-ates) are plasticizers used to soften vinyl products like <b>teething</b> <b>rings,</b> toys, * raincoats and bibs. It’s also an ingredient in scented baby products and toiletries (soaps, shampoos and lotions). Children can ingest phthalates when they chew on vinyl products or inhale them from personal care products. Phthalate exposure has been linked to demasculinization 1, 2, low sperm count 3, adverse genital development in boys 4, hypospadias 5, premature breast development in girls 6, shortened length of pregnancy 7, and the development of asthma and rhinitis. 8 Both human and animal studies support adverse effects from exposure to phthalates. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a chemical component of polycarbonate plastic used to make plastic toys, baby bottles and “sippy ” cups. It is also used to line metal food cans, including infant formula cans. Children can ingest BPA that leaches out of these products. Animal studies link early exposure to bisphenol-A to breast cancer 9...|$|R
50|$|A <b>teething</b> <b>ring</b> is {{generally}} a soft plastic device {{that can be}} chewed on and allows the baby to break {{down some of the}} gum tissue which promotes the growth of the teeth out of the gum. Some teething rings can easily be broken or damaged, so other types of teething devices can be made from household items. Placing a wet washcloth in the freezer {{for a few minutes and}} then applying it gently to the gums can be effective, but care must be taken not to expose a baby's gums to coldness for too long.|$|E

Why, sir, a woman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of {{complexion}} (and so had the woman), and swore {{that the child was}} mine and she my wife--that I had married her at such-and-such a time in such-and-such a place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I could not remember her name. Well, sir, she called my {{attention to the fact that}} the child looked like me, and really it did seem to resemble me--a common thing in the Territory--and, to cut the story short, I put it in my nursery, and she left. And by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when they came to wash the paint off that child it was an Injun! Bless my soul, you don't know anything about married life. It is a perfect dog's life, sir--a perfect dog's life. You can't economize. It isn't possible. I have tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all occasions. But it is of no use. First you'll marry a combination of calico and consumption that's as thin as a rail, and next you'll get a creature that's nothing more than the dropsy in disguise, and then you've got to eke out that bridal dress with an old balloon. That is the way it goes. And think of the wash-bill--(excuse these tears)--nine hundred and eighty-four pieces a week! No, sir, there is no such a thing as economy in a family like mine. Why, just the one item of cradles--think of it! And vermifuge! Soothing syrup! <b>Teething</b> <b>rings!</b> And 'papa's watches' for the babies to play with! And things to scratch the furniture with! And lucifer matches for them to eat, and pieces of glass to cut themselves with! The item of glass alone would support your family, I venture to say, sir. Let me scrimp and squeeze all I can, I still can't get ahead as fast as I feel I ought to, with my opportunities. Bless you, sir, at a time when I had seventy-two wives in this house, I groaned under the pressure of keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventy-two bedsteads when the money ought to have been out at interest; and I just sold out the whole stock, sir, at a sacrifice, and built a bedstead seven feet long and ninety-six feet wide. But it was a failure, sir. I could not sleep. It appeared to me that the whole seventy-two women snored at once. The roar was deafening. And then the danger of it! That was what I was looking at. They would all draw in their breath at once, and you could actually see the walls of the house suck in--and then they would all exhale their breath at once, and you could see the walls swell out, and strain, and hear the rafters crack, and the shingles grind together. My friend, take an old man's advice, and don't encumber yourself with a large family--mind, I tell you, don't do it. In a small family, and in a small family only, you will find that comfort and that peace of mind which are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford us, and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth, and no acquisition of fame, power, and greatness can ever compensate us. Take my word for it, ten or eleven wives is all you need--never go over it." ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are only}} a limit number of {{regulatory}} standard for contaminants present in toys. These regulatory standards mainly concern metals. These regulatory standards are based on several assumptions, for example the amount of toy swallowed by a child. In addition, for other contaminants other than certain metals (e. g. lead) {{it is assumed that}} 100 % of the contaminant in the toy will reach the blood circulation and thus can cause damage to tissues and organs. However, these assumptions are not realistic for each toy or contaminant. To come to a realistic risk assessment, methods are necessary for a more accurate estimation of the amount of contaminant that is released from a toy in case it is sucked on (for example <b>teething</b> <b>ring)</b> or parts are swallowed (like finger paint). Therefore, an in vitro digestion model was developed in the current project. The extent of release of the contaminant in the gastrointestinal tract from a toy matrix can be studied with this model (bioaccessible fraction) in case the toy is sucked on or parts are swallowed. Using this bioaccessible fraction, a realistic estimation of the amount of contaminant that reaches the tissues and organs can be made. The set-up of the in vitro digestion model was so that on the one hand the human physiology of the gastrointestinal tract is simulated as closely as possible {{and on the other hand}} that it is simple, fast and cheap method...|$|E
