5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> {{evidence}} and {{information related to}} the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, {{who claims to have}} been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the {{size and scope of}} both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{optimization}} {{techniques are}} particularly useful in {{situations in which}} it is easy to determine the quality of a single solution, but hard <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> possible solutions one by one (it is easy to determine the driving time for a particular route of the delivery truck, but {{it is almost impossible to}} check all possible routes once the number of destinations grows to more than a handful).|$|E

25|$|After a year, {{one of the}} commission's {{members was}} replaced, as his tenure was finished. This delayed the work as his {{replacement}} had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the findings to catch up. The duration of the investigation was criticized by the press and next of kin, but the commission stated {{that it was necessary}} with a prescribed degree of diligence in the matter. An issue of particular interest was the ILS system at Fornebu, which would under given circumstances produce false signals. The commission found no way of terminating the shortcomings. By August 1975 a preliminary report was sent to the involved parties. Despite promises of immediate release, the publication was postponed further to sort out further details. The final draft was given to the Ministry of Transport and Communications on 18 December. The report went public on 4 January 1976.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{laboratory}} did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique {{because of the}} simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton {{had to make the}} process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through {{the laboratory}} in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|E

500|$|Coward's {{distinctive}} clipped diction {{arose from}} his childhood: {{his mother was}} deaf and Coward developed his staccato style of speaking {{to make it easier}} for her to hear what he was saying; it also helped him eradicate a slight lisp. His nickname, [...] "The Master", [...] "started as a joke and became true", according to Coward. It was used of him from the 1920s onwards. Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as [...] "The Master", he replied, [...] "Oh, you know – Jack of all trades, master of none." [...] He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: [...] "My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, my sense of my own importance to myself is tremendous." [...] When a Time interviewer apologised, [...] "I hope you haven't been bored having <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> these interviews for your [...] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself", Coward rejoined, [...] "Not at all. I'm fascinated by the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|As Salander's legal guardian, he {{uses his}} {{position}} to sexually abuse and eventually rape her. Salander turns the tables on him, torturing him and branding him as a rapist. Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist, {{although he did not}} want to emulate the stereotypical [...] "mustache-twirling pervert". The director considered Van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor—one who was a [...] "full-fledged human being" [...] and a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. [...] "He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside," [...] Fincher stated. Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, [...] "This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> that. I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things. We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable. The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding the humanity of him." ...|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{found the}} task of researching such a popular {{historical}} figure as Guevara a daunting one: [...] "If you go to any bookstore, you'll find an entire wall of Che-related material. We tried <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> of it, we were overwhelmed with information. He means something different to everyone. At a certain point we had to decide for ourselves who Che was". The original source material for these scripts was Guevara's diary from the Cuban Revolution, Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War, and from his time in Bolivia, Bolivian Diary. From there, he drew on interviews with people who knew Guevara from both of those time periods and read every book available that pertained to both Cuba and Bolivia. Bickford and Del Toro met with Harry [...] "Pombo" [...] Villegas, Urbano and Benigno—three men who met Guevara during the Cuban Revolution, followed him to Bolivia, and survived. They interviewed them individually and then Pombo and Benigno together about their experiences in Cuba and Bolivia. Urbano was an adviser while they were filming in Spain and the actors often consulted with him and the others about specific details, like how to hold their guns in a certain situation, and very specific tactical information.|$|E

Then they had {{everyone}} get up and said 'Go', {{and as soon as}} people started moving, they selected people for shooting, for execution." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{first of}} the main events is a contest of [...] "castillos" [...] (lit. castles). Castillos are frames made of wood, reed and paper to which various {{fireworks}} are affixed. These fireworks are set off to make images and/or parts of the castillo structure move. The castillos created for this event measure between twenty five and thirty meters, requiring about fifteen days to build. When set off, they take between twenty and thirty minutes <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> of their features.|$|E
2500|$|In 1851, Napoleon III {{put an end}} to the Second French Republic and {{initiated}} the Second French Empire. [...] As his uncle had done before him, he offered his protection to French Freemasonry. [...] He got the Grand Orient de France to agree to elect Prince Murat as its Grand Master but it did not wish to be represented by Murat. [...] In 1862 they gained permission to elect a different representative and Napoleon III decided to name his successor himself - this was Maréchal Magnan, who was not already a Mason and so had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> 33 ranks of Scottish Rite Freemasonry in rapid succession to take up the post. [...] The imperial decree had forgotten to mention the other French Masonic Rite, and so the [...] "Scottish Rite", under the academician Jean Viennet (1777–1868), only just managed to maintain its independence.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pearl Jam on March 9, 2009, bassist Jeff Ament said [...] "...our manager Kelly has had the idea to do a 20-year anniversary retrospective movie so he's been on board with [...] Cameron Crowe {{for the last few}} years." [...] The band's guitarist Mike McCready also stated in March, [...] "We are just in the very early stages of that, [...] [...] [...] starting <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the footage we have, and Cameron’s writing the treatment."

[...] A trailer for the movie, which featured Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder choosing between three permanent markers in a shop before turning to the camera and saying [...] "Three's good... Twenty is better," [...] was shown before select movies at the 2011 BFI London Film Festival. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and also had an accompanying book and soundtrack.|$|E
