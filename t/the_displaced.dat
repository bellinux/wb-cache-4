5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. <b>The</b> <b>displaced</b> otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E

5|$|Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a {{pre-existing}} system produced deadly flooding, {{and when}} the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much {{of the town and}} leaving residents without water or power. Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various international agencies to deploy teams to decontaminate wells. Haruna destroyed 7,402houses, which left 13,882people homeless. Most of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> people were able to leave their shelters by early April. The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath.|$|E

5|$|Flooding from Komen was {{worst in}} Rakhine State, where water {{distribution}} was contaminated, and entire towns were largely destroyed.

High winds in Lailenpi within Chin State damaged {{a school and}} a training center for community health workers. Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone. The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490,000houses and destroyed another 21,000, causing 132deaths, at least 55 of whom in Rakhine State. Komen was directly responsible for at least 39deaths in the country.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's heavy damage, {{homeless}} residents {{resided in}} temporary camps.

Many of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water to those in need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on concrete slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E

30|$|The {{primary purpose}} of {{polymers}} in EOR processes is to control the mobility of <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> phase (i.e., water). Mobility {{is defined as the}} ratio of the relative permeability of the fluid (i.e., water or oil) to the viscosity of the same fluid. The importance of controlling fluid mobility to increase macroscopic displacement efficiency has been well recognized by many researches (Pitts et al. 1995; Du and Guan 2004; Kotlar et al. 2007). The addition of polymer to <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> phase (i.e., water) reduces its mobility by thickening the aqueous phase and significantly diminishing the formation of viscous fingerings and/or channels. A simultaneous mechanism taking place during polymer flooding is the reduction of the relative permeability to <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> phase caused by the retention of polymer (adsorption and mechanical retention) within the porous media. Therefore, polymer flooding is very effective in improving the volumetric sweep efficiency.|$|R
30|$|In {{secondary}} oil recovery, uneven {{advance of}} <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> injected fluid arises from “short circuits” caused by large fractures diverting water around, and thereby bypassing, oil bearing zones.|$|R
30|$|The overall oil {{displacement}} efficiency during {{oil recovery}} processes {{is defined by}} the product of the macroscopic displacement efficiency (macro-scale) and the microscopic displacement efficiency (micro-scale). Macroscopic displacement efficiency {{is a measure of the}} effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> fluid(s) in contacting the oil zone volumetrically; while microscopic displacement efficiency refers to the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> fluid(s) in mobilizing oil trapped at the pore scale by capillary forces. Therefore, any displacement mechanism that can improve either the macro-scale or micro-scale oil sweep efficiency during polymer flooding is beneficial to increment oil production (Romero-Zerón 2012).|$|R

In the winter of 1900–01, for example, disputes between the Pike and North Lake Company and its rival the Wisconsin Lakes Ice and Cartage Company over the rights to harvest ice resulted in pitched battles between workers and the deployment of a steamship icebreaker to smash competing supplies.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the navy, army, and local government devised a cleanup plan. Three hundred government employees (with guidance of the military) worked to clear debris. They quickly restored water and power service, and within a few days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area. Authorities in Manzanillo asked for medicine, clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross treated the injured. Many of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> were evacuated to government offices. Within {{a few days after the}} storm, the ports of Manzanillo, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States.

The other two hurricanes were Hurricane Calvin in 1993 and a hurricane that struck Baja California Sur in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the disaster, Luis A. Ferré, the Governor of Puerto Rico, {{declared a state of emergency}} over the whole island, asking for $10 million (1970 USD) in federal aid. On October12, two days after the rains subsided, President Richard Nixon declared the territory as a disaster area. Ferre also appeared in a telethon to raise funds for the homeless. The National Guard, the Red Cross, and other volunteer groups helped <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> persons. In all, the disaster was described as one of the worst in Puerto Rico history. The Governor of the Virgin Islands, Melvin Evans, requested aid similar to Puerto Rico, and that territory was also declared a federal disaster area about a week after the rains ended. The heavy rainfall in the Virgin Islands caused a marked dinoflagellate algal bloom in the days after the rains ended.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to study}} the {{anchorage}} performance of rock bolts under pull-andshear loading conditions. Laboratory tests, an analytical solution and a numerical simulation are included. The research results {{can be applied to}} mining engineering and civil engineering, in which rock bolts have been widely used as a conventional support element. A new laboratory test method was developed to apply pull and shear loads {{at the same time to}} the bolt specimen so that a displacing angle could be established in a range from 0 ° (pure pull) to 90 ° (pure shear). The influences of <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> angle, <b>the</b> joint gap, and the rock strength on the performance of rebar bolts and D-Bolts are evaluated in this study. In <b>the</b> tests, five <b>displacing</b> angles (0 °, 20 °, 40 °, 60 °, and 90 °), two joint gaps (0 and 30 mm), and three “rock” materials (weak concrete, strong concrete, and concrete-granite) were used. The test results show that the linear elastic stiffness of both the D-Bolt and the rebar bolt is mobilised quickly after a small displacement. When <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> angle is larger than 40 °, grout crushing may occur underneath the bolt shank, resulting in a reduction in the stiffness of the bolt. The ultimate load of the bolts remains approximately constant no matter what <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> angle is for both the D-Bolt and the rebar bolt. The displacement capacity of the D-Bolt, however, is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> angle. <b>The</b> ultimate displacement of a 1 -m-long D-Bolt section varies from 140 mm under pure pull (0 °) to approximately 70 mm when <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> angle is larger than 40 °. The ultimate displacement of the rebar slightly increases from 29 mm under pure pull to 53 mm under pure shear. In general, the displacement capacity of the D-Bolt is larger than that of the rebar bolt. It is approximately 3. 5 times greater than the rebar under pure pull and 50...|$|R

5|$|In {{the days}} after the storm, airstrikes and attacks {{continued}} elsewhere in the country, and only days after Chapala, Cyclone Megh followed a similar path, causing additional damage. Relief distribution was disrupted due to the poor communications in the region, worsened by the ongoing civil war, with the hardest hit areas under al-Qaeda control; aid trucks had to pass security clearances, resulting in delays. Workers began restoring communications and clearing roads in {{the days after}} the storm. By 19November, most of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> residents had returned home, although some remained in shelters due to house damage. Southern portions of Yemen saw food and fuel shortages following the two storms. Mukalla experienced an outbreak of dengue fever by January 2016 due to the floods, affecting 1,040people; earlier efforts to kill disease carrying mosquitoes were ineffective due to residual floods and unsanitary conditions. Seven people died due to the outbreak. A locust outbreak also began in December 2015 due to the floods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, Carlton Hill's notoriety as a slum increased. Poverty, drunkenness, disease and low living {{standards}} were rife. Brighton's reputation was damaged by a disparaging article in The Lancet in 1882: making reference to Carlton Hill, it criticised the town's poor standards of health. Assisted by government funding, Brighton Corporation undertook extensive slum clearance from 1928 until {{the start of}} World War II, transforming the area's appearance. Two large blocks of flats—Brighton Corporation's first council flats—were built to rehouse many of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> residents. The Milner Flats, a long four-storey block, stand {{on the site of}} Woburn Place, and were completed in 1934. Alderman Hugh Milner Black, a Corporation member who campaigned for housing improvements in Brighton, was commemorated in the naming. Kingswood Flats, on the site of Nelson Place and a Primitive Methodist chapel, were built in 1938. The name refers to Minister for Health Kingsley Wood. Some displaced residents were moved out of the area: the new council estates of Whitehawk and Moulsecoomb, built in the 1920s and early 1930s on the fringe of Brighton, accommodated many former Carlton Hill residents. An earlier low-rise development took place in 1931, when the small Tarnerland council estate was built on empty land near Tilbury Place.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol Hill station's {{design was}} {{finalized}} in 2007 and 2008, during {{a series of}} public hearings and meetings with the city's design commission. Businesses and residents at the station site were moved after Sound Transit acquired properties in 2008, leaving vacant buildings that were temporarily filled with pieces of art coordinated by Sound Transit. Salvaging and recycling of materials in the vacant buildings began in late 2008, including a community event to remove small plants for re-planting by neighborhood residents; approximately 90 percent of material was recycled, and proceeds {{from the sale of}} scrap metal were used to provide hot meals to the homeless. Demolition of buildings on the station site began in March 2009, shortly before the formal groundbreaking for the University Link project, and was completed by August. Among the 20 demolished buildings were a three-story apartment building, a used book store, the Espresso Vivace coffee shop, a nail salon, and a copy shop. Many of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> and nearby businesses moved to the northern end of the Broadway district during construction, relying on mitigation funds from Sound Transit and the neighborhood's chamber of commerce.|$|E
