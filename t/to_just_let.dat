Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. Gaga said, [...] "I wrote {{it for her}} [...] {{a long time ago}} and she just didn't use it for her album. It's fine because I love the song and I get to perform it now." [...] Spears' demo for the song leaked in May 2010. Additionally, the guest vocalist {{was originally}} going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Beyoncé the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as she felt that she seldom found time <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> loose and have fun.|$|E

It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it go for the scene.

500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you inside my head... How could you be so cruel? Turned me into a liar." [...] was directly addressed to Prodan.|$|E
500|$|Crackdown was envisioned {{to exceed}} the {{gameplay}} of Grand Theft Auto, giving the player [...] "toys" [...] {{to create their own}} in-game moments that could be verbally shared with others. [...] The crackdown logo is {{in the shape of the}} agency tower, modified. The entire playfield was to be open at the start, requiring the need to create a progression for the player, while still allowing for experimentation. [...] Realtime Worlds had hired a number of former Grand Theft Auto developers who experimented with refining the game's sandbox element. [...] "It was a big part of the idea <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> people do things", Realtime Worlds producer Phil Wilson said about the gameplay; [...] "testers would do things we were completely blown away by". Dave Jones, CEO of Realtime Worlds, described the concept of the game as [...] "How do we reward somebody for just having fun?" [...] They had initially planned to have 200 Xbox Live Achievements for the game towards this purpose, exceeded the then-current cap of 50 set by Microsoft, and pressured Microsoft to lift the cap. [...] Microsoft subsequently increased the maximum number of Achievements in a game to 80. [...] Through playtesting, the team noticed that many players performed certain out-of-the-way actions, such as climbing to the top of the Agency Tower. [...] They created in-game content to reward the player for performing these actions; for example, they created a special rendering procedure for the clouds during the in-game day/night cycle. The renderer would behave differently each day, and could only be viewed from atop the Agency Tower. [...] An initial fear of Jones' was that in the early part of the game, when the Agent is underpowered, the player may not realize the potential of the game and would not complete it; [...] "People weren't quite sure, because at that level, you're kind of like most characters in most other games". [...] Jones also expressed concern that [...] "This game does not look good in screenshots". [...] They took two major steps to overcome this. [...] First, the demo for the game on Xbox Marketplace allowed for accelerated growth of the player's abilities. [...] Second, the full game included five in-game movies that would be presented early on to the player that would give them a taste for what a fully powered character could do.|$|E

While participating in the popular music competition franchise, she had difficulty dealing with the limelight. Savage was quoted as saying, [...] "You have to always realize that people are watching.

[...] Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend seemingly anti-human measures, such as severe population control and the claim regarding the Third World that [...] "the best thing would be <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve". However, Bookchin himself later admitted that [...] "statements made by Earth First! activists are {{not to be confused with}} those made by deep ecology theorists". Ecophilosopher Warwick Fox similarly [...] "warns critics not to commit the fallacy of 'misplaced misanthropy.' That is, just because deep ecology criticizes an arrogant anthropocentrism does not mean that deep ecology is misanthropic." [...] Likewise, The Deep Ecology Movement: An Introductory Anthology attempts to clarify that [...] "deep ecologists have been the strongest critics of anthropocentrism, so much so that they have often been accused of a mean-spirited misanthropy"; however, [...] "deep ecology is actually vitally concerned with humans realizing their best potential" [...] and [...] "is explicit in offering a vision of an alternative way of living that is joyous and enlivening." ...|$|E

5000|$|Horner was lauded for her {{leadership}} of Radcliffe and her {{stance on the}} issue of coeducation. Many resisted the coeducation movement of merging Harvard University and Radcliffe College because it would have meant the elimination of Radcliffe College. Ellen Sackson Heller (Radcliffe Class of 1939) stated, [...] "If Radcliffe had merged, it would have meant to me that I no longer had a college." [...] A merger would also have meant that Radcliffe would lose its autonomy. Horner said, [...] "The challenge was to see if the mandate of Radcliffe could provide a leadership model for true coeducation that gave weight to women's voices, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> women enter a male world." [...] Although Horner had many responsibilities, she made contact with Radcliffe students a priority during her presidency by holding weekly conferences and teaching several classes. Horner remained president until 1989, when she was succeeded by Linda Wilson.|$|R
