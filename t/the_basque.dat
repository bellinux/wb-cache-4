50|$|Neither the Visigoths nor the Franks ever {{completely}} subjugated the area. The Vascones (to become <b>the</b> <b>Basques)</b> included neighbouring tribes {{as of the}} 7th century. In AD 778, <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> defeated a Frankish army at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.|$|R
50|$|However, despite {{attempts}} to secure alliances in Pamplona, <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> remained allied to the Banu Qasi family {{based in the}} valley of the River Ebro. They continued to defy Frankish authority, as did Aragón, where the Count was allied with <b>the</b> <b>Basques.</b> Gaucelm and his brother Bernard both claimed that the truce promoted by Bera was against the Empire’s best interests and inhibited {{attempts to}} force <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> and Aragón to recognise themselves as vassals of the Empire.|$|R

5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} <b>the</b> <b>Basque</b> Country in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash Romani.

In the process, they acquired <b>the</b> <b>Basque</b> language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national Basque ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E

50|$|In 602, the Merovingians {{created a}} {{frontier}} duchy to their southwest during the tripartite wars between Franks, Visigoths, and Basques. A certain Genial was then appointed dux wasconum {{as a way}} of better handling their relations with <b>the</b> <b>Basques.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the Visigoths created the Duchy of Cantabria as a buffer against <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> inhabiting west of current Navarre.The march of Vasconia (or Wasconia) was created with the purpose of controlling <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> in Novempopulania, but it extended at this stage on the lands south and around the axis provided by the river Garonne between Bordeaux and Toulouse. About this period duke Francio is reported to vow allegiance to the Franks in Cantabria, an area inhabited by <b>the</b> <b>Basques,</b> but c. 612, the Gothic king Sisebut seems to have conquered the territory.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the evening}} of August 15, 778, Charlemagne's rearguard was {{suddenly}} attacked by <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> as they crossed the mountain pass. The Franks were caught off guard by the surprise attack, with their army in confusion and disarray {{as they tried to}} escape <b>the</b> ambush. <b>The</b> <b>Basques</b> managed to cut off and isolate the Frankish rearguard and the baggage train {{from the rest of the}} escaping army, and although <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> were not as well equipped, they held the upper ground and the knowledge of the terrain that gave them a huge advantage in the skirmish. As Charlemagne tried to regroup and evacuate his army, Roland and the others held for a considerable amount of time, before <b>the</b> <b>Basques</b> finally massacred them completely. Though killed to the last man, the rearguard nonetheless succeeded in allowing Charlemagne and his army to continue to safety. <b>The</b> <b>Basques</b> then looted <b>the</b> baggage that was left behind and took advantage of the darkness to flee, leaving no trace for the Franks to follow in the following morning.

5|$|Early {{attestations}} of {{the name}} in Basque include Errama-itçéla, Erroumancel, later errumanzel and erremaitzela. The initial E- is <b>the</b> <b>Basque</b> prosthetic vowel, added because no Basque word may begin with an R-, and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix, used when citing a name. If this etymology is correct, it is a rare case of a native Romani name for themselves (an endonym) being borrowed by another language.|$|E
5|$|Euskadiko Ezkerra, the Communist Party of Spain and the People's Alliance also issued {{statements}} {{condemning the}} attack.

5|$|St. John's {{is one of}} North America's oldest European settlements, with {{fishermen}} {{setting up}} seasonal camps in the early 16th century. Sebastian Cabot declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that St. John's earned its name {{when he and his}} father, the Venetian explorer John Cabot became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In <b>the</b> <b>Basque</b> Country, it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in <b>the</b> <b>Basque</b> Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} San Domingo {{was the last}} fleet {{engagement}} of the war between French and British capital ships in open water.

5|$|When Captain John Halliday assumed {{command of}} Gibraltar in April 1807, she was {{serving in the}} Channel, part of a fleet under Admiral James Gambier.
