2500|$|At {{the start}} of [...] (2009), the Hub is {{destroyed}} and Torchwood relocate to London as fugitives. Torchwood itself is later destroyed {{by the end of}} the serial. Fans were left asking the fate of, among other things, the Rift. The [...] of Torchwood relocates primarily to the United States. When asked in an interview with SFX magazine, Davies stated [...] "I like to think that when [...] Steven Moffat so thoughtfully closed all those cracks in the universe, the Rift in Cardiff closed up at the same time. I used to wonder what the hell happened to that Rift and now it's all solved. When I watched those cracks seal up I was like, 'Oh, thank you.'" [...] This refers to the events of the 2010 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Big Bang", which was written by Steven Moffat. However, Torchwood media in 2011 since provided a direct explanation for the Rift. In the radio drama [...] "The House of the Dead", Jack visits a haunted location where the Rift allows ghosts, including the deceased Ianto Jones, to enter into the living world. To close the Rift forever and seal an ancient evil on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Jack creates a device designed to seal the Rift. The device will also provide Jack an end to his cycle of resurrections. However, Ianto's spirit tricks Jack into leaving, and detonates the device himself, closing the Rift [...] "forever" [...] and with it the barrier between the living and the dead.|$|E
