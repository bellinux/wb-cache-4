5|$|The {{majority}} of FARDC members are land forces, {{but it also}} has a small air force and an even smaller navy. Together the three services may number between 144,000 and 159,000 personnel. In addition, there is a presidential force called <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard,</b> but it and the Congolese National Police (PNC) {{are not part of the}} Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, {{mainly the}} T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces {{through a number}} of break points along the front, allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the Global Positioning System and other new technologies.|$|E

50|$|The Iraqis {{concentrated}} {{well over}} 100,000 troops from <b>the</b> battle-hardened <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard.</b> <b>The</b> heavy {{use of chemical}} weapons quickly disarrayed the Iranian defenses, which was consisted of 15,000 Iranian Basij volunteers. The southern wing of the assault consisted of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard's</b> Madinah and Baghdad Divisions, which assaulted the Iranian lines and then allowed the Hammurabi Armoured Division to pass through and move along the southern coast of the peninsula and into al-Faw itself.|$|R

5|$|The Iraqi Army had between 350,000 and 500,000 {{soldiers}} in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight Republican Guard divisions. Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment; for example, {{most of the}} estimated 1,000 T-72 tanks in the Iraqi Army {{on the eve of}} the war were in Republican Guard divisions. The Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard,</b> the Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1991 the 24th Infantry Division would {{participate}} in a controversial engagement against <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> Hammurabi Division. It would take place well after the ceasefire. It {{is known as the}} Battle of Rumaila. Iraqi Republican Guard forces were engaged within the Hammar Marshes of the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iraq while attempting to reach and cross the Lake Hammar causeway and escape northward toward Baghdad on Highway 8. Most of the five-mile-long Iraqi caravan of several hundred vehicles was first boxed into a kill zone and then {{in the course of the}} next five hours systematically devastated by the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, including its armored forces, by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and nine artillery battalions.|$|E

5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> is the only {{component}} he trusts. Major General John Numbi, former Air Force chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel chain of command in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation Umoja Wetu; the regular chain of command was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of no confidence in the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy by the President and other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E
