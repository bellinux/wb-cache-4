50|$|In many states, <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> is {{recognized}} as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful {{to ensure that the}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Entirety</b> (United States): [...] "TBE" [...] is a {{separate}} property system in which spouses are treated as one person, each having an equal ownership {{interest in the subject}} property. In some U.S. states, <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> is limited to realty (e.g. the couple take title to the family home as tenants <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety)</b> while other states make it available for both realty and personalty (e.g. the couple can also take title to the family automobile as tenants <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety).</b>|$|R

50|$|The buyer(s) {{signing the}} real estate {{contract}} are liable (legally responsible) for providing the promised consideration for {{the real estate}}, which is typically money {{in the amount of}} the purchase price. However, the details about the type of ownership may not be specified in the contract. Sometimes, signing buyer(s) may direct a lawyer preparing the deed separately what type of ownership to list on the deed and may decide to add a joint owner(s), such as a spouse, to the deed. For example, types of joint ownership (title) may include tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, or joint <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties.</b> Another possibility is ownership in trust instead of direct ownership.|$|E
5000|$|A tenancy by the {{entirety}} (sometimes called a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties)</b> {{is a type}} of concurrent estate formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants by the Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered [...] "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for tenancy by {{the entirety}}.) Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, the tenancy by the entirety also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to [...] "ripen" [...] in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.|$|E
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, {{to create}} a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> <b>the</b> parties must specify in the deed that the {{property}} is being conveyed to the couple [...] "as tenants <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety," [...] while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed {{to create a}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> unless <b>the</b> deed specifies otherwise. (see also Sociedad de gananciales) Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship time, title, interest, and possession there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with {{any part of the}} property requires the consent of both spouses. A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety.</b> [...] Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for bankruptcy relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.|$|R

40|$|The law {{fails to}} {{accommodate}} the inconvenient fact that an individual’s identifiable genetic information is involuntarily and immutably shared with her close genetic relatives. Legal institutions have established that individuals have a cognizable interest in controlling genetic information that is identifying to them. The Supreme Court recognized in Maryland v. King that the Fourth Amendment is implicated when arrestees’ DNA is analyzed, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act protects individuals from genetic discrimination in the employment and health-insurance markets. But genetic information is not like other forms of private or personal information because it is shared — immutably and involuntarily — {{in ways that are}} identifying of both the source and that person’s close genetic relatives. Standard approaches to addressing interests in genetic information have largely failed to recognize this characteristic, treating such information as individualistic. While many legal frames may be brought to bear on this problem, this Article focuses on the law of property. Specifically, looking to <b>the</b> law of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety,</b> this Article proposes one possible framework for grappling with the overlapping interests implicated in genetic identification and analysis. <b>Tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety,</b> like interests in shared identifiable genetic information, calls for the difficult task of conceptualizing two persons as one. <b>The</b> law of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> thus provides a useful analytical framework for considering how legal institutions might take interests in shared identifiable genetic information into account. This Article examines how this framework may shape policy approaches in three domains: forensic identification, genetic research, and personal genetic testing. In some of these domains, experts are already advocating for policies consistent with this framework...|$|R
50|$|Estate {{planning}} {{involves the}} will, trusts, beneficiary designations, powers of appointment, property ownership (joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, tenancy in common, <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety),</b> gift, and powers of attorney, specifically the durable financial {{power of attorney}} and the durable medical power of attorney. After widespread litigation and media coverage surrounding the Terri Schiavo case, estate planning attorneys now often advise clients to also create a living will. Specific final arrangements, such as whether to be buried or cremated, are also often part of the documents. More sophisticated estate plans may even cover deferring or decreasing estate taxes or winding up a business.|$|R
50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety.</b> Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|R
50|$|The {{phrase is}} used to {{describe}} legal consequences that occur <b>by</b> <b>the</b> act of the law itself. For example, if property is held in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> <b>by</b> a husband and wife, who then get divorced, the property is converted ipso jure (i.e. <b>by</b> <b>the</b> law itself) into another form of tenancy, usually a tenancy in common, at the very instant the marriage is dissolved. Likewise, contracts that establish partnerships sometimes provide that the partnership is ipso jure dissolved if one partner attempts to sell his or her interest in the partnership. In all of these situations, when one legally significant fact occurs, other relationships are automatically changed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|R
5000|$|The Turner court noted many {{purposes}} of marriage, including: [...] expressions of emotional support and public commitment .... many religions recognize marriage as having spiritual significance; for some inmates and their spouses, therefore, {{the commitment of}} marriage may be an exercise of religious faith {{as well as an}} expression of personal dedication. Third, most inmates eventually will be released by parole or commutation, and therefore most inmate marriages are formed in the expectation that they ultimately will be fully consummated. Finally, marital status often is a precondition to the receipt of government benefits (e. g., Social Security benefits), property rights (e. g., <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety,</b> inheritance rights), and other, less tangible benefits (e. g., legitimation of children born out of wedlock).

40|$|It’s been a perplexing {{problem for}} years {{but it seems}} to be {{increasing}} as more of the situations come to light – years ago, grandparents conveyed property owned in joint <b>tenancy</b> (or <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety)</b> to an irrevocable inter vivos trust with retained life estates for each of the grandparents and with a remainder interest to the children. As a variation, the grandparents in setting up the trust gave life estates to the children with a remainder interest to grandchildren. The grandparents are now deceased and the questions are two fold – (1) what is included in the gross estates of each of the grandparents and (2) what is the basis {{in the hands of the}} children (or grandchildren) ? 1 The problem is drawing attention, partly because of the rapid escalation of farmland values (many of the trust situations involve farmland or vacation property) and partly because income tax considerations are now viewed as more significant than federal estate tax problems with the $ 5 million applicable credit amount available, at least for 2011 and 2012. ...|$|R
40|$|In April 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States decided United States v. Craft. The Court {{held that}} the federal tax lien {{attaches}} to a tax-debtor spouse’s interest in property held in <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> even when <b>the</b> other spouse does not owe tax and state law provides that entireties property and interests cannot be reached by separate creditors of only one spouse. Craft was correctly decided. The older, contrary view that Craft displaced was fundamentally at odds with federal tax collection analysis as laid out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Court. In addition, the old view invited tax abuse and created unfairness. Despite the wisdom of Craft, the decision has troubled some commentators. This is not surprising. As those involved in law reform efforts will readily attest, human beings, especially legal professionals, tend to eye change with suspicion. Though unsurprising, the concern about Craft is unnecessary. The message of this Article is that Craft is neither radical nor dangerous. Some of the concerns are misplaced. Other, more legitimate concerns can be assuaged by sensible answers to the implementation issues that arise {{as a result of}} Craft. Part II of this Article describes the issue addressed in Craft and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s resolution of that issue. Parts III and IV address the two concerns most frequently voiced about Craft. Part III maintains that Craft does not impermissibly impinge on the traditional role of the states in establishing property and debtor-creditor rules. Part IV describes how the rights and legitimate interests of the spouses not owing tax can be safeguarded in light of Craft. A theme underlying this Article is that the Craft decision is not, and should not be viewed as, a bolt from out of the blue. The decision was foreshadowed by earlier Court cases and represents the application of well-established rules and principles to <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> area. We have lived with those rules and principles successfully; likewise, we can adapt to Craft without undue disruption or inconvenience...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{real estate}} has {{achieved}} an exalted status and privileged position in American property law. The {{notion of the}} home as a special object deserving heightened protection is widely accepted within the case law and scholarship. Influential scholars, most notably Margaret Radin, {{have argued that the}} home is critical for an individual 2 ̆ 7 s very identity and ability to flourish in society. Other commentators have expounded a communitarian vision of the home as rooting individuals in communities of close-knit social ties. Over the past century, there has been a proliferation of legislation creating special protections for owners of residential real estate such as homestead exemptions, <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety,</b> property tax relief, and more recently foreclosure relief and state eminent domain legislation shielding residential real estate. This typeof legislation imposes a variety of social costs including raising the cost of credit, skewing housing prices and incentivizing over-investment, and forcing less affluent homeowners to subsidize more affluent homeowners through regressive measures. One motivation for residential protection legislation is the desire to protect the special values attributed to the home, especially for families. More often, the impetus for such legislation is rent-seeking by special interest groups, competition between states to attract residents, actions by local home voters who attempt to externalize costs across localities, or grandstanding by politicians anxious to capitalize on the evocative chord of home protection. The belief that homes play a critical and irreplaceable role in the lives of individuals and families has provided a gloss of moral legitimacy to rent-seeking and greased the wheels of the residential protectionism machine. It is time for a critical reexamination of the importance attributed to the home. Drawing on the research literature in psychology, sociology, and demographics this paper argues that there is scant evidence to support a categorical theory of the home as a special object that constitutes individual identity or enables a rich web of social interactions. The psychology research illustrates the importance of social interaction and relationships (not possessions) for human functioning while the demographic research indicates that closely-knit, low-turnover, territorial neighborhoods are the exception, not the norm...|$|R
40|$|On December 7, 1999, the United States Supreme Court {{unanimously}} decided Drye v. United States, a case {{likely to}} be a landmark in federal tax lien law. Drye clarified what had been muddied by previous Supreme Court and lower court decisions: the proper relation between state law and federal law in tax lien attachment cases. That clarification will permit-indeed, compel-greater analytical precision as future courts address tax lien cases. This Article discusses one such line of cases. It has long been the rule that the federal tax lien does not attach to tenancy-by-the entireties interests when (1) only one of the spouses owes tax and (2) applicable state law prohibits separate creditors of only one of the spouses from proceeding against entireties property. Unfortunately, that rule, though long standing, is conceptually bankrupt, indeed is fundamentally inconsistent with the modem understanding of tax liens. Thus, the tension in this area has been “which shall prevail: history or logic?”. History has had the ascendancy thus far, but only, I believe, because loose language in prior Supreme Court decisions created an environment in which imprecision could survive. The clarification of <b>the</b> applicable standards <b>by</b> Drye eliminates that environment. Accordingly, fidelity to Drye requires reexamination-and abolition-of the outdated rule as to attachment of the tax lien to entireties interests. This Article has five parts. Parts I, II, and III are foundational. Part I describes Drye, while Parts II and III explore the interaction of the tax lien and <b>tenancies</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> before Drye. Specifically, Part II explains the development and nature of the current rule as to attachment of the federal tax lien to entireties interests (called hereafter the 2 ̆ 2 entireties bar 2 ̆ 2). Part III argues that, for both policy and doctrinal reasons, <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> bar was a dubious rule of law even before Drye. Parts IV and V carry the central message of this Article: the effect of Drye on the current rule. Part IV begins with the central curiosity as to <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> bar: given its shortcomings, why does the rule command widespread acceptance? The Part concludes that the explanation is historical: the rule developed before clear elaboration of modem tax lien doctrine and has survived vestigially, by inertia. Part IV then describes the doctrinal clarification wrought <b>by</b> Drye. In <b>the</b> glaring light of Drye, no comer of shadow remains in whose murk <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> bar can plausibly be defended. Finally, Part V considers objections, that is, arguments (inadequate in my view) in favor of survival of the current rule despite Drye...|$|R
40|$|The legal {{institution}} of settlement of property The aim of my thesis is {{to analyze the}} {{legal institution}} of settlement of property {{and the impact of}} the new civil code and its principles. The legal institution of settlement of property forms {{an essential part of the}} legal order and as such is an institution which is very important in a day to day life.
