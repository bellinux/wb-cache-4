25|$|In Norse mythology, {{earthquakes}} were {{explained as}} the violent struggling {{of the god}} Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>jerk</b> his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{received}} generally negative {{reviews for}} her portrayal. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it {{wrote of the}} decision to sign Francis onto the series: [...] "Maria Arena Bell just made Brian Frons kick a puppy in the face." [...] After her debut, he called Francis' portrayal of Genevieve [...] "embarrassingly-bad", stating: [...] "I'm sure I will catch hell for going here about a daytime treasure, but Francis' portrayal of Cane and Caleb's (Daniel Goddard) unhinged mother has been cartoonish and abysmal from her first air show. I don't know if Francis is painfully attempting to channel the late Elizabeth Taylor’s fun, campy turn as Luke and Laura's arch nemesis Helena Cassadine on General Hospital 30 years ago, or going for Evil-Lyn from the old He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, but she's missing the mark either way." [...] He also wrote that as much as he would [...] "love to solely blame this performance on the writing—because let’s face it, the story is dreadful—Francis is the one making the choices <b>to</b> <b>jerk,</b> gasp and wince as Genevieve registers each and every emotion or painful memory. This is not the Genie Francis we know and love." [...] Adam Hughes of Yahoo! wrote of viewers' reactions to Francis' debut and her portrayal, stating: [...] "Since Francis arrived on the scene this spring, fan reaction to her revised on-screen attitude has been a mixed bag, but she continues to draw a ton of interest to her new CBS television digs. Former General Hospital followers may find her more biting character hard to swallow, and longtime fans of The Young and The Restless have watched her push aside some of their favorites, but Francis has undoubtedly shaken up the local landscape. Buzz is half the game when comes to keeping soap opera fans interested, and Francis has certainly delivered that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Deputy Robinson {{had been}} killed, {{and it took}} 103 {{stitches}} to stabilize Warden Conley. [...] One of the slashes from Rock's blade had come a mere eighth of an inch from severing the warden's jugular, and he carried the scar from that wound to his deathbed. [...] None of the rioters had died, and Conley made sure they were all fully healed before bringing them up on charges. [...] Rock and Hayes were both given the death sentence for the assault, Stevens won his acquittal and served his original sentence, and Young's was extended to a life sentence. [...] Conley oversaw both of the executions (Rock on 16 June 1908 and Hayes on 2 April 1909). [...] The men were hanged using the upright jerker method, which used a [...] weight <b>to</b> <b>jerk</b> the sentenced man from his feet. [...] This method was supposed to snap the neck, but it failed in both instances. [...] Rock and Hayes {{were the only two}} men to be executed within the prison walls.|$|E
2500|$|Penn and Teller often conduct {{informal}} experiments. For example, in {{the episode}} [...] "Bottled Water", diners in an upscale restaurant {{are presented with}} a variety of apparently fancy bottled water brands. After the diners praise and pick a favorite, it is revealed that each bottle was filled by the same garden hose behind the restaurant. In one of their more serious experiments during the [...] "Conspiracy Theories" [...] episode, Teller fires a rifle at a melon wrapped in one-inch fiberglass tape to demonstrate that when a human head is shot, {{it is likely to be}} forced in the direction opposite to the bullet's trajectory. This demonstration was aimed at discrediting a John F. Kennedy conspiracy theory that points out that the fatal gunshot rocked Kennedy toward the shot through the use of simple principles of physics (i.e., [...] "back and to the left", the fallacious belief that a shot from behind would cause a head <b>to</b> <b>jerk</b> forward is used as evidence that JFK must have been shot from the grassy knoll, in front of the vehicle).

I knew I physically couldn't sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help.

50|$|The chopper {{cars were}} {{originally}} targeted as K sets {{and for a}} while when they entered service, they ran together with the then-force ventilated K sets. This however caused problems in service as force-ventilated cars were fitted with camshaft control and led <b>to</b> <b>jerking</b> while accelerating. By December 1990 they had been retargeted as C42-C54. In January 1991 these were reformed as 6-car sets numbered C1-C8. By June 1991 all had been transferred to Hornsby Maintenance Depot.|$|R
2500|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of neural}} circuit is a reflex arc, which {{begins with a}} sensory input and ends with a motor output, passing through a sequence of neurons connected in series. [...] This can be shown in the [...] "withdrawal reflex" [...] causing a hand <b>to</b> <b>jerk</b> back after a hot stove is touched. [...] The circuit begins with sensory receptors in the skin that are activated by harmful levels of heat: [...] a special type of molecular structure embedded in the membrane causes heat to change the electrical field across the membrane. [...] If the change in electrical potential {{is large enough to}} pass the given threshold, it evokes an action potential, which is transmitted along the axon of the receptor cell, into the spinal cord. [...] There the axon makes excitatory synaptic contacts with other cells, some of which project (send axonal output) to the same region of the spinal cord, others projecting into the brain. [...] One target is a set of spinal interneurons that project to motor neurons controlling the arm muscles. [...] The interneurons excite the motor neurons, and if the excitation is strong enough, some of the motor neurons generate action potentials, which travel down their axons {{to the point where they}} make excitatory synaptic contacts with muscle cells. [...] The excitatory signals induce contraction of the muscle cells, which causes the joint angles in the arm to change, pulling the arm away.|$|E
2500|$|The type of cast {{used when}} fishing varies {{according}} to the conditions. The most common cast is the forward cast, where the angler whisks the fly into the air, back over the shoulder until the line is nearly straight, then forward, using primarily the forearm. The objective of this motion is to [...] "load" [...] (bend) the rod tip with stored energy, then transmit that energy to the line, resulting in the fly line (and the attached fly) being cast for an appreciable distance. However, just bending the rod and releasing it <b>to</b> <b>jerk</b> the fly line forward (like a bowstring or a catapult) will not propel the fly line and fly very far. More important is {{the movement of the}} rod through an arc acting as a lever, magnifying the hand movement of the caster (of about a foot) to an arc at the rod tip of several feet. Here the rod acts as a lever. In fact, one of the Class 3 types of lever, where The force is applied between the fulcrum and the load (like tweezers). The fulcrum in the fly cast is below the caster's hand gripping the rod; the load is at the rod tip; between the hand exerts the force. The caster's [...] "stroke" [...] backwards and forwards, for the backcast and the forward cast, operates the rod as a (slightly flexible) lever. Casting without landing the fly on the water is known as 'false casting', and may be used to pay out line, to dry a soaked fly, or to reposition a cast. Other casts are the roll cast, the single- or double-haul, the tuck cast, and the side- or curve-cast.|$|E
