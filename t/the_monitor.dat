5|$|On 8 March 1862, the Confederate Navy {{initiated}} the first combat between ironclads when the Virginia successfully attacked the blockade. The next day, <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> engaged the Virginia in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Their battle {{ended in a}} draw, and the Confederacy later lost the Virginia when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture. <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> was the prototype for <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> warship and many more were built by the Union Navy. While the Confederacy built more ironclad ships during the war, they lacked the ability to build or purchase ships that could effectively counter the monitors.|$|E

5|$|Many {{details of}} Monitors history and {{insights}} of everyday crew life {{have been discovered}} from correspondence sent from the various crew members {{to family and friends}} while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, often referred to as <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> Chronicles, to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitors service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard <b>the</b> <b>Monitor.</b> The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners' Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|No {{trace of}} <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> was found until {{the corpse of}} a sailor in a dinghy and a few {{lifebuoys}} washed ashore on the Finnish island of Kremare. Extensive searches of the sea bottom also failed to locate the ship. In January 1894 a commission appointed to investigate convened and reprimanded Rear Admiral P. S. Burachek, commander of the detachment, for letting Rusalka go to sea in bad weather as well as Lushkov for losing contact with <b>the</b> <b>monitor.</b> The commission concluded that the ship's steering gear failed or that water had entered the ship and caused her to lose power. Either would have caused Rusalka to turn parallel to the waves where her superstructure would have been demolished and extensive flooding would have soon overwhelmed her small reserve of buoyancy. Whatever the cause, Rusalka obviously broached and sank {{with the loss of}} all 177 members of her crew.|$|E
