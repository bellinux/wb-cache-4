5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. <b>The</b> <b>grit</b> is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>grit</b> was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

5|$|The medical {{problems}} of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. <b>The</b> <b>grit</b> and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E

5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away <b>the</b> <b>grit</b> used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E

25|$|Most of the niacin in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as niacytin, which is niacin {{bound up in}} a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. Niacytin is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate <b>the</b> <b>grit</b> from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the niacin content of the cornmeal.|$|E
500|$|Gritters {{can also}} be used in hot weather, when {{temperatures}} are high enough to melt the bitumen used in asphalt. <b>The</b> <b>grit</b> is dropped to provide a protective layer between the road surface and the tires of passing vehicles, which would otherwise damage the road surface by [...] "plucking out" [...] the bitumen-coated aggregate from the road surface.|$|E
500|$|Salt {{reduces the}} melting point of ice by freezing-point depression, {{causing it to}} melt at lower {{temperatures}} and run off {{to the edge of}} the road, while sand increases traction by increasing friction between car tires and roadways. The amount of salt dropped varies with the condition of the road; to prevent the formation of light ice, approximately [...] is dropped, while thick snow can require up to [...] of salt, independent of the volume of sand dropped. <b>The</b> <b>grit</b> is sometimes mixed with molasses to help adhesion to the road surface.

30|$|<b>The</b> {{abrasive}} <b>grit</b> size has a {{major influence}} on the surface roughness and the surface finish, the improvement by using a smaller grit size abrasive is significant. During grinding, only a small top region of <b>the</b> abrasive <b>grits</b> is efficient for metal removal, the remaining part is sliding and rubbing the workpiece material (Sin et al. 1979). <b>The</b> coarser <b>grit</b> size abrasives have bigger abrasive particles, causing larger areas of rubbing during grinding; meanwhile, the size and distribution of <b>the</b> abrasive <b>grit</b> grains are more uneven in coarser grit size abrasives; thus, more defects and a worse surface finish have been induced by using coarser grit size abrasives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the {{cellulose}} industry the Kraft {{process is}} widely used to produce cellulose. This process generates huge volumes of inorganic solid wastes, including <b>the</b> <b>grits</b> waste. In Brazil, the final disposal of this solid waste is of high economical and environmental interest. The present work assesses the influence of <b>the</b> addition of <b>grits</b> waste on <b>the</b> densification behavior of soil-cement bricks. The raw materials used were soil, Portland cement, and grits waste. Soil-cement bricks containing up to 30 wt. % grits waste in partial replacement of Portland cement were prepared by uniaxial pressing and cured for 28 days. The following technological properties were determined: water absorption, compressive strength, and durability. The microstructure was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The experimental results indicated that <b>the</b> addition of <b>grits</b> waste influenced positively the densification behavior of the soil-cement bricks. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>grits</b> waste could {{be incorporated into the}} soil-cement brick composition up to 20 wt. % as a partial replacement of Portland cement...|$|R

500|$|While Ten {{deals with}} dark subject matter, it has {{generally}} {{been seen as a}} high-water mark of the early 1990s alternative rock sound, with Vedder's unusually deep and strong (and later much-imitated) voice alternating between solidity and vibrato against the unrestrained, guitar-heavy, hard rock sound that drew influence from Led Zeppelin and other rock bands of the 1970s. Tens musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an [...] "expansive harmonic vocabulary" [...] with an anthemic sound.

500|$|The common loon's {{breeding}} range has moved northward, the species breeding {{as far south}} as Iowa a century ago. It is adversely affected by acid rain and pollution, as well as lead poisoning from fishing sinkers (especially those that are about the size of <b>the</b> <b>grit</b> stones they ingest) and mercury contamination from industrial waste. [...] Heavy metals such as mercury may be partially removed through biological processes such as excretion or deposition in feathers, but their adverse effects are magnified through concentration of the toxic elements in organs such as the liver. Eggs shells may also contain metal contaminants, leading to low reproductive productivity. High levels of heavy metals are linked to loons being in poor condition, males being affected more because they eat larger fish.|$|E
