5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. <b>The</b> <b>bass</b> clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to <b>the</b> <b>bass</b> (though not as dark).|$|E
50|$|Since the {{scientists}} have found the new species of bass, {{their goal is to}} make sure that the population and habitat stays healthy by starting conservation practices early instead of later. FWC has found that the biggest danger to <b>the</b> Choctaw <b>bass</b> comes from <b>the</b> spotted <b>bass</b> and <b>the</b> Alabama <b>bass,</b> which are closely related to it. So far everywhere {{scientists have found}} Choctaw bass there has been an absence of <b>the</b> Alabama <b>bass</b> and <b>the</b> spotted <b>bass,</b> this is good news because <b>the</b> different <b>bass</b> species are often introduced outside of their native range to try and popularize sport fishing, which can offset <b>the</b> native <b>bass.</b> If spotted bass and Alabama bass were to be introduced into the habitat of <b>the</b> Choctaw <b>bass,</b> these species can overtake <b>the</b> Choctaw <b>bass</b> through interbreeding thus lowering the number of purebred Choctaw bass.|$|R
50|$|In his A New History of <b>the</b> Double <b>Bass,</b> Paul Brun asserts, {{with many}} references, that <b>the</b> double <b>bass</b> has origins as <b>the</b> true <b>bass</b> of <b>the</b> violin family. He states that, while the {{exterior}} of <b>the</b> double <b>bass</b> may resemble <b>the</b> viola da gamba, the internal construction of <b>the</b> double <b>bass</b> is nearly identical to instruments in the violin family, and {{very different from the}} internal structure of viols.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{electric}} <b>bass</b> is {{a relative}} newcomer {{to the world of}} jazz. The big bands of the 1930s and 1940s Swing era and the small combos of the 1950s Bebop and Hard Bop movements all used <b>the</b> double <b>bass.</b> <b>The</b> electric <b>bass</b> was introduced in some bands in the 1950s and it became prominent during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when rock influences were blended with jazz to create jazz-rock fusion. The introduction of <b>the</b> electric <b>bass</b> in jazz fusion, as in the rock world, helped bassists play in high-volume stadium concerts with powerful amplifiers, because it is easier to amplify <b>the</b> electric <b>bass</b> than <b>the</b> double <b>bass</b> (<b>the</b> latter is prone to feedback in high-volume settings). <b>The</b> electric <b>bass</b> has both an accompaniment and a soloing role in jazz. In accompaniment, the bassist may perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and jazz standards, playing smooth quarter note lines that imitate <b>the</b> double <b>bass.</b> For latin or salsa tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, <b>the</b> electric <b>bass</b> may play rapid, syncopated rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove.|$|R
5|$|The {{light on}} the small rock of Oxcars was {{automated}} as early as 1894. At {{that time it was}} controlled by a clockwork timer and was powered using gas delivered weekly from Granton gasworks. A lighthouse was constructed on <b>the</b> <b>Bass</b> Rock in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The second romance, in A minor, {{an exuberant}} piece, {{has a strong}} semiquaver figure {{supporting}} the theme, and running high into the treble and low into <b>the</b> <b>bass.</b> This was later {{to become one of}} Fauré's most recognisable characteristics.

5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that <b>the</b> <b>bass</b> instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Musicmaster <b>Bass</b> variant {{was also}} {{introduced}} in the mid-1960s and was originally marketed as a student model. Rather than the split-coil design of <b>the</b> Mustang <b>Bass,</b> it featured a single-coil pickup, which was actually a six-pole Stratocaster guitar pickup under a solid plastic cover. Production ceased {{around the same time}} as <b>the</b> Mustang <b>Bass.</b> <b>The</b> Squier Musicmaster <b>Bass</b> was reissued briefly in 1997, however it was discontinued after only one year of production and was ultimately replaced by <b>the</b> Bronco <b>Bass.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1966 as a {{companion}} to Fender's shorter-scaled, two-pickup Fender Mustang guitars, <b>the</b> Mustang <b>Bass</b> was <b>the</b> last original <b>bass</b> designed by Leo Fender before his departure from the company in 1965. <b>The</b> Mustang <b>Bass</b> has a short 30" [...] scale and a single split pickup (similar to <b>the</b> Precision <b>Bass),</b> one volume and one tone control, with strings-through-body routing. Like the early Precision and Jazz <b>basses,</b> <b>the</b> Mustang <b>Bass</b> was fitted with string mutes (although most players removed these).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> yellow <b>bass</b> is not {{as popular}} a gamefish as either <b>the</b> White <b>bass</b> or <b>the</b> Striped <b>bass,</b> because of its small size. They are usually caught by anglers fishing with crappie jigs or minnows. These fish may also be caught in large numbers because of their large populations. <b>The</b> yellow <b>bass</b> is not edible.|$|R
5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing <b>the</b> <b>bass,</b> as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E

British singers {{appearing}} {{with the company}} included Janet Baker, Heather Harper, John Tomlinson and Richard Van Allan. Davis's tenure, {{at that time the}} longest in The Royal Opera's history, closed in July 1986 not with a gala, but, at his insistence, with a promenade performance of Fidelio with cheap admission prices.|$|E
5|$|Angus died at Tantallon in January 1557, and {{the castle}} {{was seized by}} the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise. It was given over to the Laird of Craigmillar, and repairs were carried out the {{following}} year. In 1558, George Drummond of Blair was keeper of Tantallon, with a garrison of seven horsemen and 22 soldiers. James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton took control in 1565, {{on behalf of his}} nephew, the young 8th Earl of Angus, but the following year, Mary, Queen of Scots, gave the Captaincy to Robert Lauder of <b>the</b> <b>Bass,</b> and his son, Robert Lauder, younger of <b>the</b> <b>Bass</b> The appointment of the Lauders followed the surrender of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven, who was one of those charged with the murder of Queen Mary's favourite, David Rizzio, in March 1566. Mary visited Tantallon herself in November 1566. The Yester Writs record an Andrew Hume as Captain of Tantallon Castle in 1577. Following the death of the 8th Earl in 1588, the Earls of Angus lived elsewhere, and {{had little to do with}} Tantallon Castle.|$|E
