5|$|Scotties, {{while being}} {{described}} as very loving, {{have also been}} described as stubborn. They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, {{although it has been}} noted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
5000|$|The Fiddlin' Five: The 1957-58 {{team was}} given its {{nickname}} by Rupp due <b>to</b> his perception <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> [...] "fiddle" [...] early in games. However, they would right their ship {{in time to}} give Rupp his 4th and last national title.|$|R
30|$|The PSTs {{found the}} idea of ‘trouble’ useful when they were {{analysing}} {{what was happening in}} their transcripts. In fact, they found it so useful <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> see ‘trouble’ everywhere, particularly Pedagogical trouble, which refers to the lesson management breaking down or the lesson not unfolding as expected.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{geographic}} concentration, it is noted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be isolated {{and had an}} insular culture. As a result, <b>they</b> also <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be very late in their adoption of the English language and of western culture in general. The insular culture and resultant intermarriage {{can result in a}} high degree of consanguinity amongst Vathimas.|$|R
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> follow dry seasons.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|The Gaelic Revival of {{the early}} twentieth century has had a {{long-term}} influence. There is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoirí) in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast. They represent an expanding demographic, with their own schools (called Gaelscoileanna) and their own social media. It has been argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, with better employment prospects and higher social status. Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar. Irish is also taught in mainstream English-speaking schools as a compulsory subject, but has been criticised for its ineffectiveness.|$|E
5000|$|A 2011 {{study of}} European e-patients found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "inquisitive and autonomous" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> noted <b>that</b> {{the number of}} e-patients in Europe {{appeared}} to be rising. A 2012 study found that e-patients uploading videos about their health experienced a loss of privacy, but also positive benefits from social support.|$|R
40|$|Mature {{students}} are often {{said to be}} deficient in study skills, but a recent literature review by Richardson concluded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> exhibit more desirable approaches to learning. Using a shortened form of the Approaches to Studying Inventory, a comparison between 38 mature and 60 non-mature students taking the same course found indeed that the mature students obtained significantly higher scores on meaning orientation, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> also <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> produce lower scores on reproducing orientation. In addition, {{in terms of both}} their persistence and their attainment, the subsequent academic performance of the mature students on their degree courses was at least as good as that of the non-mature students...|$|R
50|$|Koyré was {{suspicious}} of scientists' claims to prove natural or fundamental truths through experiments. He argued these experiments {{were based on}} complicated premises, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> prove the outlook behind these premises, rather than any real truth. He repeatedly critiqued Galileo's experiments, claiming {{that some of them}} could not have taken place, and brought into question the results Galileo claimed and which modern historians of science had hitherto accepted.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E
25|$|A common feature {{among new}} Hindu {{communities}} in Java is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> rally around recently built temples (pura) or around archaeological temple sites (candi) {{which are being}} reclaimed as places of Hindu worship.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{performance}} evaluation {{models in the}} academic literature also describe performance measurement. What distinguishes performance paradox from these other models is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> restrict their scopes either to explanations for changing performance criteria or to endorsements of maximizing on a specific, defined set of static criteria. Performance paradox alone predicts that maximizing {{on a set of}} predictably shifting criteria generates positive outcomes for organizations, most accurately describing most actual organizations' behavior.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary theory treats Bloch as the Clausewitz of {{the early}} 1900s. A review in 2000 in the journal War in History [...] {{concentrates}} on the interaction between Bloch's theory and the military professionals of the time. In short, it finds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> dismiss Bloch, on the basis that, while his [...] "mathematics" [...] might be correct, his overall message ran {{the risk of being}} bad for morale.|$|R
2500|$|The {{problem with}} these {{dictionaries}} was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> {{be little more}} than poorly organised and poorly researched glossaries of [...] "hard words": words that were technical, foreign, obscure or antiquated. But perhaps the greatest single fault of these early lexicographers was, as historian Henry Hitchings put it, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> [...] "failed to give sufficient sense of [...] language as it appeared in use." [...] In that sense Dr. Johnson's dictionary was the first to comprehensively document the English lexicon.|$|R

500|$|Another {{problem with}} BLEU scores is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> favor short translations, which can produce very high {{precision}} scores, even using modified precision. An {{example of a}} candidate translation for the same references as above might be: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. But we get to play around a little bit, too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to {{a large number of}} deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} Cyanea are able to grow tall stalks is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> grow in deep forest, often in narrow gulches on the older islands, where there is little wind. [...] This {{characteristic}} of growing under dense cover also makes them more sensitive to disturbance of the forest.|$|E
3000|$|Like all {{plastics}} {{manufactured in}} Ecotopia, the extruded houses {{can be broken}} up and thrown into biovats, digested by micro-organisms into fertilizer sludge, and thus recycled onto the fields from whence their materials came. Oddly, the one serious problem encountered {{when they were first}} used was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> blow away in high winds. But instead of our heavy, excavated foundations, they now use large adjustable corkscrew devices which anchor each corner but leave the earth surface undisturbed. (…) [...]...|$|R
50|$|Nelson {{believed}} that film distributors didn't have any systems for accountability {{in place and}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> buy the rights to entire catalogs rather than individual films, so she and Madison {{decided to do it}} themselves. Since they needed a legal entity to make distribution contracts valid, they incorporated Indie Rights in 2007. Nelson said doing both film production and distribution gives them a greater understanding of the challenges that filmmakers face than would a company that focuses only on distribution.|$|R
5000|$|Although the gimmick {{was hailed}} as being {{innovative}} for its time, the tobacco itself was criticized for being bland and the devices {{had a tendency to}} jam. [...] According to one smoker, [...] "Invariably, the tobacco wouldn't distribute consistently so every cigarette was different - always bad. Some were so tightly stuffed {{that there was no way}} to draw. Some were so loose <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> go up in flame (or the tobacco just fell out)". [...] The product was eventually discontinued.|$|R
2500|$|Ash bricks {{have been}} used in house {{construction}} in Windhoek, Namibia since the 1970s. There is, however, a problem with the bricks in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> fail or produce unsightly pop-outs. This happens when the bricks come into contact with moisture and a chemical reaction occurs causing the bricks to expand.|$|E
2500|$|Although the plasmid methods avoid viruses, {{they still}} require cancer-promoting genes to {{accomplish}} reprogramming. The other main issue with these methods is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> {{be much less}} efficient compared to retroviral methods. Furthermore, transfected [...] plasmids [...] {{have been shown to}} integrate into the host genome and therefore they still pose the risk of insertional mutagenesis.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{entities}} {{that in the}} Middle Persian texts are demons, are in the Shahnameh attributes of demons, for instance, varuna [...] "backwards" [...] or [...] "inside out," [...] reflecting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> do {{the opposite of what}} they are asked to do. Although Ferdowsi generally portrays divs as being distinct from humans, the poet also uses the word to denote [...] "evil people." ...|$|E
5000|$|NAACP lawyers Samuel W. Tucker, Henry L. Marsh, III, and Oliver W. Hill {{prepared}} the petitioners' case, and Tucker presented their arguments. Frederick T. Gray represented the school board, and Louis F. Claiborne served as amicus curiae. While the Court {{did not rule}} that all [...] "freedom of choice" [...] plans were unconstitutional, it did note <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be ineffective at desegregating a school system and held that in New Kent County's case the freedom-of-choice plan violated the Constitution.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that when analyzing graphically presented single-subject data, subjects trained in visual inference appear to attend to large changes between phases regardless of relative variation and do not differentiate among common intervention effect patterns. In this follow-up study, experts in applied behavior analysis completed a free-sort task designed to assess {{the effects of these}} dimensions on their use of visual inference. The results indicate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> differentiate among common intervention effect patterns but did not attend to relative variation in the data...|$|R
50|$|In {{a recent}} study, {{researchers}} asked patients with left neglect to project their midline with a neon bulb and found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> point it straight ahead but position it rightward of their true midline. This shift {{may account for}} the success of therapeutic prism glasses, which shift left visual space toward the right. By shifting visual input, they seem to correct the mind's sense of midline. The result is not only the amelioration of visual neglect, but also of tactile, motor, and even representational neglect.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{research}} suggests that the unemployment effects of small minimum wage increases are dominated by other factors. In Florida, where voters approved an increase in 2004, a follow-up comprehensive study after the increase confirmed a strong economy with increased employment above previous years in Florida and better than in the US as a whole. When it comes to on-the-job training, some believe the increase in wages is taken out of training expenses. A 2001 empirical study found that there is [...] "no evidence that minimum wages reduce training, and little evidence <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> increase training." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "CEO confidence—that look {{in their}} eyes, {{their view of}} the animal spirits—appears to be back in {{stronger}} measure than I at least have heard in some time. What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I think most of my colleagues around the table know, is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to me about a week ago, 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{other factor}} {{reducing}} {{the attractiveness of}} hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> perform poorly during equity bear markets, just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value. For example, in January–September 2008, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index was down 9.87%. According to the same index series, even [...] "dedicated short bias" [...] funds had a return of −6.08% during September 2008. In other words, even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period, for example around the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.|$|E
