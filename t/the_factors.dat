5000|$|The {{sale of the}} {{receivable}} transfers {{ownership of}} the receivable to <b>the</b> <b>factor,</b> indicating <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> obtains all of the rights associated with the receivables. Accordingly, the receivable becomes <b>the</b> <b>factor's</b> asset, and <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> obtains <b>the</b> right to receive the payments made by the debtor for the invoice amount, and is free to pledge or exchange the receivable asset without unreasonable constraints or restrictions. Usually, the account debtor is notified of {{the sale of the}} receivable, and <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> bills <b>the</b> debtor and makes all collections; however, non-notification <b>factoring,</b> where <b>the</b> client (seller) collects the accounts sold to <b>the</b> <b>factor,</b> as agent of <b>the</b> <b>factor,</b> also occurs. <b>The</b> arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>factor.</b> [...] If <b>the</b> <b>factoring</b> transfers <b>the</b> receivable [...] "without recourse", <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> (purchaser of <b>the</b> receivable) must bear the loss if the account debtor does not pay the invoice amount. If <b>the</b> <b>factoring</b> transfers <b>the</b> receivable [...] "with recourse", <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> has <b>the</b> right to collect the unpaid invoice amount from the transferor (seller). However, any merchandise returns that may diminish the invoice amount that is collectible from the accounts receivable are typically the responsibility of the seller, and <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> will typically hold back paying the seller for a portion of the receivable being sold (the [...] "factor's holdback receivable") in order to cover the merchandise returns associated with <b>the</b> <b>factored</b> receivables until <b>the</b> privilege to return the merchandise expires.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> reverse <b>factoring</b> method, still rare, {{is similar}} to <b>the</b> <b>factoring</b> insofar as it {{involves}} three actors: the ordering party, the supplier and <b>the</b> <b>factor.</b> Just as basic <b>factoring,</b> <b>the</b> aim of the process is to finance the supplier’s receivables by a financier (<b>the</b> <b>factor),</b> so <b>the</b> supplier can cash in the money for what he sold immediately (minus an interest <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> deducts to finance the advance of money).|$|R
