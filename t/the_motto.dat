5|$|A motto, {{placed on}} a scroll below the Royal Arms of England, seems to have first been adopted by Henry IV in the early 15th century. His motto was Souverayne ("sovereign"). His son, Henry V adopted <b>the</b> <b>motto</b> Dieu et mon droit ("God and my right"). While this motto has been {{exclusively}} used since the accession of George I in 1714, and continues to form part of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom, other mottoes were used by certain monarchs in the intervening period. Veritas temporis filia ("truth {{is the daughter of}} time") was <b>the</b> <b>motto</b> of Mary I (1553–1558), Semper Eadem ("always the same") was used by Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and Anne (1702–1714), James I (1603–1625) sometimes used Beati pacifici ("blessed are the peacemakers"), while William III (1689–1702) used <b>the</b> <b>motto</b> of the House of Orange: Je maintiendrai ("I will maintain").|$|E

The rays were not removed, and <b>the</b> <b>motto</b> was moved to the reverse. Approval of the models followed in April, again with minor suggestions.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinctive}} Greek flag of {{blue and}} white cross was first hoisted during the Greek War of Independence in March 1822.

Beneath the shield is <b>the</b> <b>motto</b> in Greek, Ἰσχύς μου ἡ αγάπη του λαου ("The people's love is my strength").
