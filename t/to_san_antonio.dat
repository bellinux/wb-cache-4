5|$|Santa Anna led an army <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> de Bexar, {{arriving}} on February 23, 1836, and immediately initiating a siege of the Alamo, which housed Texian Army troops. As the Mexican Army had approached San Antonio, {{several of the}} Alamo defenders brought their families into the Alamo to keep them safe. During the twelve days of the siege, Alamo co-commander William Barret Travis sent multiple couriers to the acting Texas government, the remaining Texas army under James Fannin, and various Texas communities, asking for reinforcements, provisions, and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The 500Hispanic {{settlers}} who {{had lived}} near Los Adaes had to resettle in San Antonio in 1773.

The settlers were given only five days to prepare to relocate <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio.</b> Many of them perished during the three-month trek and others died soon after arriving.|$|E

5|$|Writing in the Handbook of Texas, {{historian}} Thomas Ricks Lindley {{maintains that}} the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account.

It was likely melted down with many of the other cannons when the Mexican army retreated.|$|E
5|$|Eichelberger was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in the 25th Infantry on 11 June 1909, but {{was transferred to the}} 10th Infantry at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, on 22 July. In March 1911, the 10th Infantry was despatched <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Texas, where it became part of the Maneuver Division, which was formed to undertake offensive operations during the Border War with Mexico. Then, in September, it was sent to the Panama Canal Zone. It was in Panama that Eichelberger met Emmaline (Em) Gudger, the daughter of Hezekiah A. Gudger, the Chief Justice of the Panama Canal Zone Supreme Court. After a brief courtship, they were married on 3 April 1913.|$|E
5|$|Houston offered Bowie a {{commission}} {{as an officer}} on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining {{that he wanted to}} be in the midst of the fighting. Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin. He distinguished himself again in the Grass Fight on November 26. Cós had sent approximately 187men to cut grass for his horses. As they returned <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Bowie took 60mounted men to intercept the party, which they believed carried valuable cargo. The Mexican troops quickened their pace in the hopes of reaching the safety of the city, but Bowie and his cavalry chased them. At the end of the fight, the Texians had two wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Desha left Kentucky {{and assumed}} an alias. He went to New Orleans. From there, he {{traveled}} {{with a man}} named Thomas Early <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Texas. When Early went missing during their travels, Desha fell under suspicion. A former Kentuckian living in Texas recognized Desha. Arrested soon after Early's body was found, Desha confessed to the murder after being recognized by a second man from Kentucky. A day before his trial was to start, Desha died of a fever. A legend soon arose that he had faked his death and fled to Hawaii, where he married a native woman and fathered several children. Later historians have debunked that myth.|$|E
5|$|Krueger retired <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Texas, where, in February 1946, {{he bought}} a house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill {{left over from the}} war, he was unable to buy it {{outright}} and so some of his friends established the Krueger Fund Committee, which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} an excuse to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the countries were at war.

5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Laffoon moved <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Texas, {{where he}} opened a law {{practice}} and managed a citrus fruit business near Galveston. Though he had intended {{this to be a}} permanent relocation, while on a visit to family a few months later, friends urged him to return to Kentucky, and he obliged after only three months in Texas. In 1921, he sought election to the bench of the Fourth District Circuit Court. In the primary, he defeated Trice Bennett, a candidate from Princeton, and went on to face Republican incumbent Carl Henderson of Marion. In the general election on November 8, 1921, Laffoon defeated Henderson, carrying every county in the district. In his first term, only 7 percent of his decisions were reversed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was a record for the Fourth District at the time. He was re-elected for a second six-year term in 1927.|$|E
