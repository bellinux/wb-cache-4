40|$|When {{considering}} a graph problem from <b>a</b> parameterized point <b>of</b> view, the parameter chosen is often <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal solution <b>of</b> this problem (the "standard" parameter). A natural subject for investigation {{is what happens}} when we parameterize such a problem by various other parameters, some of which may be the values of optimal solutions to different problems. Such research is known as parameterized ecology. In this paper, we investigate seven natural vertex problems, along with their respective parameters: <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum independent set, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum vertex cover, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum clique, <b>the</b> chromatic number, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum dominating set, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum independent dominating set and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum feedback vertex set. We study the parameterized complexity of each of these problems with respect to the standard parameter of the others. Comment: 17 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a technique using linear programming {{that may be}} used to analyse the worst-case performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> class <b>of</b> greedy heuristics for certain optimisation problems on regular graphs. We demonstrate the use of this technique on heuristics for bounding <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum maximal matching (MMM), a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) and a minimum independent dominating set (MIDS) in cubic graphs. As a result, we show that for n-vertex connected cubic graphs, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMM is at most 9 n/ 20 + O(1), <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MCDS is at most 3 n/ 4 + O(1) and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MIDS is at most 29 n/ 70 + O(1). We also consider n-vertex connected cubic graphs of girth at least 5 and for such graphs we show that <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMM is at most 3 n/ 7 + O(1), <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MCDS is at most 2 n/ 3 + O(1) and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MIDS is at most 3 n/ 8 + O(1) ...|$|R

40|$|Network {{controllability}} is {{an important}} topic in wide-ranging research fields. However, the relationship between controllability and network structure is poorly understood, although degree heterogeneity is known to determine the controllability. We focus on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum dominating set (MDS), <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> network controllability, and investigate the effect of degree-degree correlation, which is universally observed in real-world networks, on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS. We show that disassortativity or negative degree-degree correlation reduces <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS using analytical treatments and numerical simulation, whereas positive correlations hardly affect <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS. This result suggests that disassortativity enhances network controllability. Furthermore, apart from the controllability issue, the developed techniques provide new ways of analyzing complex networks with degreedegree correlations...|$|R
2500|$|A newborn has a {{very small}} stomach capacity.

25|$|A Remembrall is a small, clear orb, about <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> marble, {{containing}} {{smoke that}} turns red when it detects {{that the person}} holding it has forgotten something.

30|$|The {{use of the}} RPS may not be {{necessary}} for a trained gynaecologist to determine <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> ring required by the patient.

25|$|Currently, three lizards and one toad {{are known}} to inhabit Diego Garcia, and {{possibly}} one snake. All {{are believed to have}} been introduced by human activity. The house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus), the mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris), the garden lizard (an agamid) (Calotes versicolor), and the cane toad (Bufo marinus). A viable population of a type of blind snake from the family Typhlopidae may be present, probably the brahminy blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus). This snake feeds on the larvae, eggs, and pupae of ants and termites, and is about <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> earthworm.|$|E
25|$|The loon, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> duck {{or small}} goose, resembles these birds in shape when swimming. Like {{ducks and geese}} but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are {{connected}} by webbing. The bird may be confused with cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), which are not too distant relatives of divers and like them are heavy set birds whose bellies – unlike those of ducks and geese – are submerged when swimming. Flying loons resemble plump geese with seagulls' wings that are relatively small {{in proportion to the}} bulky body. The bird points its head slightly upwards during swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.|$|E
25|$|The Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) is a {{combination}} of a high-temperature furnace with a mass spectrometer. It was used to bake samples of Martian dust and determine its content. It has eight ovens, each about <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> ball-point pen, which were able to analyze one sample each, for a total of eight separate samples. Team members measured how much water vapor and carbon dioxide gas were given off, how much water ice the samples contained, and what minerals are present that may have formed during a wetter, warmer past climate. The instrument also measured organic volatiles, such as methane, down to 10 ppb. TEGA was built by the University of Arizona and University of Texas at Dallas.|$|E
