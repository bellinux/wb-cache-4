25|$|On July 28, 2017, UC Irvine {{rescinded}} {{the admission}} offers of over 500 incoming undergraduates. While the university claimed they rescinded so many offers of admission due to 2nd semester high school grades and late transcripts, some people speculate {{the real reason}} is <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students receiving admission offers accepting them. Approximately 7,100 of 31,000 freshmen offered admission to UC Irvine in 2017 accepted it, which is 850 more students than UC Irvine's planned freshman class of 6,250.|$|E
25|$|Fewer than 100 {{people lived}} {{in the village of}} Murton before 1830 but, {{following}} the sinking of the mine in 1838, the population grew to 1,387 by 1851. Miners flocked to Murton from across County Durham and Northumberland in the early years, with people later uprooting from Devon, Cornwall and Ireland <b>too.</b> <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road and place names reflected the original roots of these pitmen, like the Cornwall estate, and dozens of different accents could be heard in the streets.|$|E

25|$|Banking {{institutions}} in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of currency and deposits in other banksequal to {{only a fraction of}} the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E
25|$|The East Room {{was among}} the last rooms on the State Floor to be {{completed}} and used. The White House was unfinished when President John Adams occupied it between 1800 and 1801. His wife, Abigail Adams, hung laundry in the bare East Room to dry. Although much of the White House was finished and decorated during Adams administration, the East Room was not. The room's lone artwork was {{a copy of the}} Lansdowne portrait depicting George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797. It was purchased by the White House in 1800, and hung in the East Room. (Rescued from the 1814 fire, it still hangs there, with a companion portrait of Martha Washington painted by Eliphalet Frazer Andrews in 1878.) There was extensive feeling in Congress that Adams had adopted <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trappings of monarchy, and Congress declined to appropriate funds to finish the room for fear it would look too much like a throne room. During the Jefferson administration, 38 gold-and-black painted chairs were purchased and placed in the room, but little else is known of the room's furnishings prior to 1814. Jefferson also had the East Room partitioned (using canvas and sailcloth for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both Private Secretary to the President).|$|E

500|$|When {{developing}} Shadow Dragon, {{the team}} {{did not see}} it as a simple remake, but rather a [...] "renewal" [...] of the original on a new platform with new and updated mechanics. The most difficult part was balancing this with maintaining the original version's atmosphere. Numerous features were added to the experience, such as displays for movement and attack range, the ability to change classes and unit recruitment if <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original army fell in battle. Expanded difficulty options and tutorials were also added to help ease newcomers into the series. The by-then well established Weapon Triangle was also introduced, replacing the unbalanced systems from the original. The addition of a single mid-battle save was intended to help ease newcomers into the series, so they would not need to restart the entire battle if a key unit fell. The dual screen display of both map and unit placement and status was indirectly inspired by the original version, which allowed players to view character stats without dropping out of the map.|$|E
500|$|Craig Stanford, Professor of Biological Sciences and Anthropology at the University of Southern California, {{gave the}} book a {{generally}} positive review in American Scientist, but offered critique {{by suggesting that}} [...] "f there is a flaw in this tightly written, insightful book, it is that Wade provides perhaps <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock examples of human evolution. In my view, he spends too much time and space attempting to convince the reader that we did indeed evolve from apes (duh!) and that our own social behavior and cognition have roots in the deep human past." [...] Peter Dizikes of The New York Times also gave a mostly positive review, calling it a [...] "timely and informative survey." [...] However, he criticised Wade's claim that [...] "the development of lactose tolerance shows broadly that 'genes respond to cultural changes'", and posited the alternative view that it is [...] "a case of genes responding to an environmental change produced by society â the abundance of milk-producing cattle â and not to any abstract cultural practice." [...] Dizikes also took issue with Wade's {{use of the word}} [...] "race", saying that the [...] "judgment that these regional genetic tendencies constitute 'races' has no deep scientific rationale, either.

500|$|Gladstone, who {{had never}} set foot on his plantation, had been deluded by his {{attorney}} in Demerara, Frederick Cort, into believing that it was seldom necessary to punish the slaves. He asserted they were generally happy and contented, {{and were able to}} make considerable money by selling the surplus produce of their provision grounds. Subsequent to the revolt, the secretary of the London Missionary Society warned Gladstone that Cort had been lying, but Gladstone continued to identify himself with Cort and his other agents. Robertson, his second son, inspected the estates from 22 November 1828 to 3 March 1829, during which he observed that Cort was [...] "an idler and a deceiver" [...] who had mismanaged one estate after another. Only then was Cort dismissed. In Britain, Lord Howick and others criticised the concept of absentee landlords. Sir Benjamin d'Urban, who took up his office of Lieutenant Governor of Essequibo and Demerara in 1824, wrote to Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for the Colonies, on 30 September 1824, criticising [...] "..the injudicious managers under whom <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slaves are placed; half educated men of little discretion, or command over their own caprices; good planters perhaps â but quite unfit to have the charge of bodies of men, although they might take very proper care of cattle".|$|E
500|$|U. S. Senate. His Republican primary {{opponent}} was George Aiken, {{the popular}} two-term Governor of Vermont. Although Flanders admired and liked Aiken, {{he felt that}} Aiken's [...] "liberal" [...] ideas would not help the nationâs economic recovery. [...] In 1990, one of Vermontâs major newspapers, The Rutland Herald described the 1940 Republican primary campaign as dirty and mean. Aikenâs side accused Flanders of selling arms to the Nazis, and Flandersâs side suggested that [...] "Aiken was unduly influenced by his administrative assistant, a pretty 24-year-old with a fondness for power." [...] In retrospect, Flanders {{felt that he had}} allowed his campaign advisers to make <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decisions. [...] For example, a campaign brochure showed the candidate wearing a three-piece suit and holding a piglet in his arms. Although he had grown up on a subsistence farm and had an active interest in Vermont agricultureâespecially in the type of hog shown in the pictureâthis had the effect of making him appear to be a phony. The Rutland Herald observed that, âIn Vermont in 1940, pigs were common to many households. But so was common sense. There were many people, most in fact, who did not want as their representative someone who would wear his best clothes if he intended to be handling pigs.â Aiken won by 7,000 votes, having spent $3,219.50 to Flandersâs $18,698.45. This campaign taught Flanders that âI had to be myself.â ...|$|E

[...] Shortly after Nixon's statement the United States and the Soviet Union began the SALT arms control talks, which eventually resulted in nuclear arms controls {{as well as the}} 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The U.S. commitment to end BW programs helped provide the lead for ongoing talks led by the United Kingdom in Geneva. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. These arms control talks would eventually lead to the Biological Weapons Convention, an international treaty outlawing biological warfare.|$|E

Numerous attempts at repeal failed. On June 27, after a meeting with President Trump at the White House, McConnell signaled improvements for the repeal and replacement: [...] "We're not quite there.

USGamer's Jeremy Parish, in his Chrono Cross retrospective, felt that the creators were needlessly harsh in their treatment and uncertain fates of returning Chrono Trigger characters, a sentiment also echoed by Tieryas. Furthermore, Parish criticized the size and quality of the cast, comparing it to a failed attempt to mimic PokÃ©mon or Suikodens large casts. He concluded that <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters didn't impact the game enough, stating, [...] "The characters are the definition of slight â most of them have little personality outside of a hokey accent â but the core cast has purpose, while everyone else is there in case {{you want to have a}} giant voodoo doll, mushroom man, or baby alien in your party for some reason. Simon Seamann of RPGamer also criticized the difficulty in switching characters and transferring equipment between them, which he felt discouraged players from experiencing the full-breadth of the varied cast. Lack of character development outside of the core, required cast of characters was also cited as a problem.|$|E
