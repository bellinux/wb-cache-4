5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both ixodid and argasid ticks {{by a combination of}} a projecting capitulum at the front and a soft, leathery skin.

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{literature}} of antiquity and <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient book reciprocally conditioned each other.

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically takes <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curve illustrated above. An {{economy that}} is operating on the PPF {{is said to be}} efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{studies of}} {{different}} groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all {{contributed to a}} new view of the period. Although the Junkers did, indeed, continue to control the officer corps, they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters {{as much as the}} Sonderweg theorists had hypothesized.

5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan. This time Alambusha, {{as well as}} Iravan, uses {{illusion}} in combat. Alambusha attacks Iravan with a bow, but Iravan counters, breaking Alambusha's bow and slicing the giant into several pieces. Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself. Then Iravan assumes <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serpent Shesha (Ananta), and his serpent army surrounds him to protect him. Alambusha counters this by assuming the form of Garuda (the eagle-man), the eternal foe of the serpents, and devours the serpent army. Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} {{it is not clear that}} this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E

5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms depend on <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as {{the positions of}} sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); {{this can be accomplished}} roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna takes <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea {{is killed}} by fire and regenerates {{afterwards}} from seed released from burnt follicles. It has is {{some degree of}} serotiny, that is, it has an aerial seed bank in its canopy in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> follicles of the old flower spikes. However, numbers of seed are less than other co-occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire. Unusually for banksias, B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing {{in the absence of}} a bushfire trigger. Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.|$|E

5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work came in <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it {{is not confined to}} coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Boletus subluridellus is {{classified}} in the section Luridi of the genus Boletus. Section Luridi is characterized by boletes that immediately turn blue with cutting or bruising, narrow pores that are usually red, and the occasional presence of toxins in the fruit bodies. According to the scheme proposed by Smith and Thiers, <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dermatocystidia (cystidia on the cap cuticle) is important to species delimitation in section Luridi. In a 1993 study, however, Roland Treu found no major consistent microscopic differences between B.subluridellus, B.rufocinnamomeus, and B.roseobadius.|$|E

5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire.

During this time, the country's increasingly-brittle government was held together almost entirely by Washington's charismatic authority.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{graduated}} from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War.
