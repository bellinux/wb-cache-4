5|$|From Puerto de Caballos, Gil González sailed west along <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> the Amatique Bay, {{and founded}} a Spanish {{settlement}} {{near the mouth}} of the Río Dulce, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> a point east of the Cape of Honduras (near modern Trujillo). From there he marched inland in search of a route to the Pacific. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon searched of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, {{near the mouth of}} the Dulce River.|$|E
5|$|Gert {{was a large}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of its}} lifespan; it always remained close enough to <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116deaths and 16missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170million.|$|E
5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast {{with the}} idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned down because the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of <b>the</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>to</b> produce. Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E

5|$|The Carmel Mountain {{has three}} main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si’ach. For {{the most part}} these valleys are undeveloped natural {{corridors}} that run up through the city from <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of the}} mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons.|$|E
5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types. These were sometimes placed low {{down to get}} maximum advantage from enfilading fire whereas others were placed high up making them much harder to capture.

Then, {{just as they}} began to dig in, the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk in response to the German Afrika Korps' advance. They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote in his diary about his constant fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E
5|$|Before Ginger struck North Carolina, the American Red Cross set up 28emergency shelters in six counties, {{where about}} 5,500people stayed during the storm. The National Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Virginia Beach, Virginia, with gale warnings extending northward to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. United States military officials evacuated planes and ships from the Norfolk, Virginia, region, {{in addition to}} flying planes down <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> warn boaters of the approaching storm. Ferry services around the Outer Banks were canceled during the storm's passage, while the Coast Guard ordered the evacuation of workers in three lighthouses.|$|E

50|$|By 1859 British {{opinion was}} no longer {{supportive}} of their nation's presence in <b>the</b> Mosquito <b>Coast.</b> <b>The</b> British government returned the Bay Islands and ceded {{the northern part of}} <b>the</b> Mosquito <b>Coast</b> <b>to</b> Honduras, negotiating with Guatemala to enlarge the British territory in Belize as compensation. The next year, Britain signed the Treaty of Managua, ceding the rest of <b>the</b> Mosquito <b>Coast</b> <b>to</b> Nicaragua.|$|R
5|$|Concord resumed her patrol {{on station}} in August 1898, but {{returned}} to the Philippines on 19 December to assist in putting down the insurrection. Her duty consisted of patrolling <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> restrict insurgent movements and shipping; bombarding various strongholds; and aiding United States Army operations. Except for a voyage to Guam in March 1900 to deliver stores, and a brief voyage to Hong Kong for repairs, Concord remained in Philippine waters until June 1901, when she sailed by way of Alaskan waters to San Francisco, arriving 28 September 1901. She cruised with the Fleet in Mexican waters, then went out of commission on 26 February 1902 at Mare Island.|$|E
5|$|Facing the British V Corps was the 1st Parachute Division (1.

5|$|From Cozumel, {{the fleet}} looped around {{the north of}} the Yucatán Peninsula and {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> the Grijalva River, which Cortés named in honour of the Spanish captain who had discovered it. In Tabasco, Cortés anchored his ships at Potonchán, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cortés was able to communicate with the Aztecs. From Tabasco, Cortés continued to along the coast, and went on to conquer the Aztecs.|$|E
