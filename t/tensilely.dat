For example, there are compressively strained bonds directly next to an edge dislocation and <b>tensilely</b> strained bonds beyond {{the end of an}} edge dislocation. These form compressive strain fields and tensile strain fields, respectively. Strain fields are analogous to electric fields in certain ways. Specifically, the strain fields of dislocations obey similar laws of attraction and repulsion; in order to reduce overall strain, compressive strains are attracted to tensile strains, and vice versa.|$|E

(110)/Si(110) nanomembrane, an elastically twofold {{symmetric}} {{system in}} which it is possible to transfer strain that is biaxially isotropic[28]. <b>Tensilely</b> strained Si(110) has emerged as an option for complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices because of its high carrier mobility[36, 43]. Traditional methods to fabricate <b>tensilely</b> strained Si(001) rely on epitaxial growth of a Si layer on plastically relaxed SiGe(001) substrates. This process does produce strained Si(001), although with nonuniform strain and with roughness. It is not effective, however, for fabricating strained Si(110). For a given Ge concentration, the kinetic critical thickness for plastic relaxation is much lower in the (110) than in the (001) orientation. As a consequence, strain grading in SiGe(110) results in a threading dislocation density that is more than ten times higher in (110)- than in (001)-oriented relaxed SiGe substrates[44]. Furthermore, other strain relief mechanisms, i.e., roughening[45] and mosaic tilt[46], have been reported for strain relaxation in SiGe(110).|$|E
30|$|Mechanically {{straining}} freestanding NMs {{can transform}} Ge into a direct-band gap, efficient light-emitting material if sufficient strain can be induced. The work {{is based on}} the theoretical prediction that biaxial tensile strain in Ge has the effect of lowering the conduction-band edge at the direct (Γ) point relative to the L valley minima (which determine the fundamental, but indirect, gap at zero strain), while the overall band gap energy correspondingly decreases[58]. In the presence of electrical or optical pumping, a substantial population of electrons at the Γ minimum can therefore be established in sufficiently <b>tensilely</b> strained Ge, thereby increasing the light emission efficiency and enabling optical gain. If the strain exceeds 1.9 %, the fundamental band gap even becomes direct.|$|E

Anisotropy of electron mobility, the highest along the [1 (1) over bar 0] direction {{and the lowest}} along [1 1 0], is systematically observed in all QWs, and well-fitted with a sinusoidal function of the current-flowing direction angle. The mobility anisotropy is minimum in the lattice-matched case and enhanced by both compressive and tensile strains in the QWs. We consider that random piezoelectric scattering, which is enhanced by the average normal strain in the QW, has anisotropy and {{plays an important role}} for the observed results.

X-ray diffraction measurements showed the expected c-lattice parameter shift for compressive strain, but no detectable shift for <b>tensilely</b> strained substrates, while reciprocal space mapping confirmed the tensile strained film maintained epitaxial coherence. Transport measurements showed a successively (from tensile to compressive) lower resistance and a complete suppression of the metalinsulator transition at highly compressive lattice mismatch.

Our simulations clearly reveal the size and strain dependence of graphene's elastic moduli, allowing comparison to experimental data. Although the recently measured difference of a factor 2 between the asymptotic value of the Young modulus for <b>tensilely</b> strained systems and the value from ab initio calculations remains unsolved, our results do explain the experimentally observed increase of more than a factor 2 for a tensile strain of only a few permille.

40|$|The {{polarization}} {{dependence of}} the absorption coefficient for compressively and <b>tensilely</b> strained quantum wires is investigated {{as a function of}} strain, the lateral wire width, and the ratio between the wire and barrier widths. The results are markedly different from the case of an unstrained quantum wire and exhibit a significant variation with the sign and amount of built‐in strain. In the case of compressive strain, absorption of light polarized in the growth direction is considerably suppressed near the band edge, while the ratio between the absorption coefficients for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the wire is determined by the relative prominence of strain and quantum confinement effects. A discussion of how these results can be applied to characterization of the achieved quantum confinement by polarization‐resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy is given. © 1995 American Institute of Physics. ...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to exploiting thinness and transferability for fabricating novel devices, one {{can take advantage}} of the mechanical compliance of freestanding NMs to establish a uniform or spatially varying strain field in the thin crystalline sheet[4, 20, 27 – 29], in some cases producing strain distributions that are not possible in the bulk[28]. Elastic strain sharing between a crystalline SiGe sheet sandwiched between two crystalline Si sheets completely unsupported by a solid allows the fabrication of <b>tensilely</b> strained SiNMs[4, 20, 28]. This method has been developed to create defect-free single crystals of SiGe, something not feasible with conventional approaches[30]. A spatially varying strain field has been established in Si nanoribbons by growing ‘local stressors’ (e.g., Ge or InAs quantum dots (QDs)) rather than a uniform stressor layer[27, 29, 31]. Additionally, one can use applied mechanical strain, as opposed to lattice mismatch-induced strain, to create new properties[32]. In all these cases, induced strain gives us control over the lattice constant and the symmetry of lattice expansion or contraction.|$|E
40|$|Strain {{relief in}} lattice {{mismatched}} heteroepitaxy is mediated by formation and/or propagation of dislocations. Due to their technological significance, {{the process of}} strain relief in materials with face-centred cubic (fcc) lattices has been analyzed by several researchers 1, 2 following the work by Matthews and co-workers in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s 3 - 6. In the Matthews model, {{it is assumed that}} the strain relieved by any misfit dislocation is equal to the edge component of the dislocation burgers vector in the interface plane. This assumption has been used in all subsequent analyses of strain relief in lattice mismatched heteroepitaxy [1, 2]. Based upon the known three-dimensional atomic structure of the dislocations in fcc lattices, we show that the assumption is not valid for the 60 degree dislocations that form/expand via the conservative glide process. For compressively (<b>tensilely)</b> strained films the assumption is valid only for the 90 degree dislocations that form/expand via aggregation of vacancies (interstitials).

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the first year of a program designed to develop life prediction and constitutive models for two coated single crystal alloys used in gas turbine airfoils. The two alloys are PWA 1480 and Alloy 185. The two oxidation resistant coatings are PWA 273, an aluminide coating, and PWA 286, an overlay NiCoCrAlY coating. To obtain constitutive and/or fatigue data, tests were conducted on coated and uncoated PWA 1480 specimens <b>tensilely</b> loaded in the 100, 110, 111, and 123 directions. A literature survey of constitutive models was completed for both single crystal alloys and metallic coating materials; candidate models were selected. One constitutive model under consideration for single crystal alloys applies Walker's micromechanical viscoplastic formulation to all slip systems participating in the single crystal deformation. The constitutive models for the overlay coating correlate the viscoplastic data well. For the aluminide coating, a unique test method is under development. LCF and TMF tests are underway.

40|$|Cross-sectional {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy (STM) is used {{to study}} lattice matched InGaAs/InP quantum well (QW) intermixing induced by ion implantation and thermal annealing. Different strain development in QWs (determined by STM topography of elastic relaxation in cross sectionally cleaved samples) {{is found to be}} dependent upon the range of the implanted ions relative to the QWs. It is found that the quantum wells remain latticed matched to the barrier layers after intermixing when ions are implanted through the multiple quantum well (MQW) stack. A shallow implantation in which ions are implanted into the cap layer above the MQW stack leads to <b>tensilely</b> strained wells and compressively strained interfaces between wells and barriers. The strain development in the latter case is attributed to different degrees of interdiffusion on the group III and group V sublattices. Finite element elastic computations are used to extract the group V and group III interdiffusion length ratio, and results using different diffusion models are compared. A preferred group V interdiffusion in the case of shallow implantation is explained in terms of faster diffusing P related defects compared to In related defects.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{relaxation}} behavior {{in a series of}} InGaAs/GaAs multiquantum well (MQW) p-i-n photodiodes grown by molecular beam epitaxy on (001) GaAs with a miscut angle of 3 ” towards [1 lo]. The series included diodes with a well width of 65 A and an indium content of 30 %, barrier widths ranging from 5 OA to 25 OA and a different number of periods. The high-resolution X-ray diffraction scans have been interpreted through the anisotropic elasticity theory and the dynamical theory. Results show that the MQW structure is partially relaxed with respect to the GaAs substrate. The in-plane partial relaxation of the MQW increases with the average indium content in the period and the total thickness. In samples with an in-plane partial relaxation lower than- 3 %, the thick GaAs layer capping the MQW is <b>tensilely</b> strained due to the in-plane relaxation of the whole structure. However, for an in-plane relaxation higher than 3 %, the GaAs cap is almost Molly relaxed with respect to the MQW region. The dislocations present at the interfaces between the GaAs substrate and the MQW, and between the MQW and the GaAs cap, produced the inclination of the material. This tilt could be separated from the inclination resulting from the non tetragonal distortion of the strained unit cells...|$|E
40|$|As we {{approach}} the end of traditional CMOS scaling, further improvements in integrated circuit performance and functionality will become limited by the inherently low carrier mobility and indirect bandgap of silicon. These performance shortcomings can be supplemented with high performance semiconductors such as Ge and GaAs, which have respectively improved carrier mobilities and a direct bandgap for efficient light emission. However, due to the economic superiority of Si-based microelectronics, {{it is unlikely that}} the CMOS industry will abandon Si entirely. Instead, it will be necessary to integrate materials such as Ge and GaAs with the Si platform by means of engineered substrates. In this thesis, thin Ge layers were transferred to Si by wafer bonding of compositionally graded structures. This approach combines the beneficial aspects of graded buffers with those of wafer bonding to provide a coplanar integration platform for lattice-mismatched semiconductors. The various innovations that were necessary to realize epitaxial layer transfer from virtual substrates stem from the fact that thin films of Ge are difficult to planarize. The large surface roughness of graded buffers requires smoothing of the surface prior to bonding. The poor surface passivation of GeO 2 in aqueous chemo-mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries necessitates that Ge virtual substrates be planarized indirectly, using a deposited CMP layer. Furthermore, H-induced exfoliation is the only practical method of separating a thin Ge layer from the surface of a virtual substrate, leading to extensive surface damage of the transferred layer. (cont.) This damage is traditionally removed using a CMP step for exfoliated Si layers. However for Ge transfer, a Sio. 4 Geo. 6 etch-stop layer was incorporated for damage removal using a selective chemical etch. These techniques have enabled transferal of epitaxial Ge-on-insulator (GOI) structures to large diameter Si wafers. <b>Tensilely</b> strained layers have the ability to attract interstitially-dissolved hydrogen and accelerate the nucleation of platelets- both of which contribute to the layer exfoliation process. As a result, a strained Sio. 4 Geo. 6 layer was used to enhance the exfoliation kinetics of Ge by providing a gettering site for ion-implanted hydrogen. During 250 C annealing of hydrogen-implanted Si 0. 4 Ge. 6 /Ge gettering structures, preferentially-nucleated platelets are made to grow within the Sio. 4 Ge. 6 layer with minimal loss of hydrogen to surface effusion. Subsequent annealing at a temperature exceeding > 300 C yields significantly improved surface blistering kinetics over samples which do not contain a gettering layer. A platelet growth model was formulated accounting for both chemical and strain energy contributions to the free energy of platelet formation. Microstructure and strain relaxation data corroborate the free energy computations, revealing two kinetically- limited regimes of platelet growth within <b>tensilely</b> strained Sio. 4 Geo. 6 layers. Low temperature annealing allows the platelets to grow in the strain-limited regime, resulting in a local platelet density of > 1010 cm- 2 and significantly improved exfoliation kinetics. Incorporation of strained layers has the potential of reducing the implantation dose necessary for layer transfer. Combined with virtual substrate bonding, gettering structures provide a promising solution for economical integration of high performance materials with silicon. by Arthur Joseph Pitera. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Optoelectronic devices {{operating}} in the mid-infrared spectral region are attracting increasing attention due to potential applications {{in a wide range}} of disciplines. For example, mid-infrared photodetectors play a key role in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion, whereby a photovoltaic device is used to extract electrical power from heat radiation. This technology is attractive for waste heat harvesting and clean energy production in several different environments. Similarly, mid-infrared light sources are particularly useful for biochemical sensing and spectroscopy, where the distinctive absorption features of many molecular species of interest can be exploited for their sensitive identification and detection. Both devices are investigated in this thesis work. 	In the area of TPV energy conversion, I have studied the use of intersubband transitions in semiconductor quantum cascade structures as a means to overcome the fundamental limitations of existing TPV devices using mature InP-based technology. Very efficient coverage of the incident radiation spectrum and optimal current matching can be achieved using multiple quantum-cascade structures monolithically integrated with a p-n junction, by taking advantage of their intrinsic cascading scheme, spectral agility, and design flexibility. Numerical simulations indicate that this approach can effectively double the present state-of-the-art in TPV output electrical power. 	In the area of mid-infrared light sources, my work has focused on developing efficient light emitters based on <b>tensilely</b> strained Germanium nanomembranes (Ge NMs). These ultrathin (a few ten nanometers) single-crystal membranes are good candidates for the development of CMOS-compatible Group-IV light sources, by virtue of their ability to sustain large strain levels and in the process become direct-bandgap materials.

The DCXRD measurements provided accurate information on composition, strain and layer thickness, while PR was used to determine the energies of the full manifold of allowed and forbidden critical point interband QW transitions. A three-band effective mass formalism was used to model the QW transitions to derive structural information on each sample. The energies of the ground-state QW transitions, H_ 1 _ 1 and L_ 1 _ 1, were found to increase with tensile strain, becoming degenerate near 0. 36 % tensile strain. Room temperature PR and conventional reflectance (R) measurement have been performed on two I. R. emitting InGaAs/GaAs/AlAs vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) structures. The R measurements were modelled using a transfer matrix formalism to determine errors in the growth fluxes. A new PR lineshape model has been developed based on energy dependent Seraphin coefficients, to describe the cavity mode interaction with a confined-state QW transition. The model is demonstrated on a set of PR spectra, and used in a novel way to derive the #DELTA##epsilon#_ 2 spectrum of the QW layers directly. The results are compared with those taken of the QW layers directly after removing the top Bragg stack reflector. Whilst the QW layers in one sample were found to be close to nominal, the In composition of QW in the other sample was found to depart significantly from the nominal 23 %, and was found to be 28 %. Room temperature and #approx# 80 K PR measurements were performed on three InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dot (QD) structures: a sample with a single layer of QDs, and two with two layers. The PR revealed five equally spaced confined-state QD transitions, at both 80 K and room temperature, with #approx# 54 meV separation. The behaviour of the QD 1 transition as a function of temperature was investigated and an anomalous increase in linewidth was observed on cooling. Annealing of one of the samples produced a strong blue shift (#approx# 250 meV) and narrowing of the QD transitions.

As a preliminary to the device studies Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport in bulk Si strained as if grown on Si(_ 0. 77) Ge(_ 0. 23) and Si(_ 0. 55) Ge(_ 0. 45) substrates {{have been carried out}} at 300 K, for field strengths varied from 10 (^ 4) to 2 x 10 (^ 7) Vm(^- 1). The calculations indicate an enhancement of the average electron drift velocity when Si is <b>tensilely</b> strained in the growth plane. The enhancement of electron velocity is more marked at low and intermediate electric fields, while at very high fields the velocity saturates at about the same value as unstrained Si. In addition the ensemble Monte Carlo method has been used to study the transient response to a stepped electric field of electrons in strained and unstrained Si. The calculations suggest that significant velocity overshoots occurs in strained material. Simulations of n-channel Si/Si(_ 1 =z) Ge(_z) MODFETs with Ge fractions of 0. 23, 0. 25, and 0. 45 have been performed. Five depletion mode devices with x = 0. 23 and 0. 25 were studied. The simulations provide information on the microscopic details of carrier behaviour, including carrier velocity, kinetic energy and carrier density, as a function of position in the device. Detailed time-dependent voltage signal analysis has been carried out to test device response and derive the frequency bandwidth. The simulations predict a current gain cut-off frequency of 60 ± 10 GHz for a device with a gate length of 0. 07 /nm and a channel length of 0. 25 um. Similar studies of depletion and enhancement mode n-channel Si/Sio. 55 Geo. 45 MODFETs with a gate length of 0. 18 /im have been carried out. Cut-off frequencies of 60 ± 10 GHz and 90 ± 10 GHz are predicted for the depletion and enhancement mode devices respectively. A Monte Carlo model has also been devised and used to simulate steady state and transient electron and hole transport in SOI-LBJTs. Four devices have been studied and the effects of junction depth and silicon layer thickness have been investigated. The advantage of the silicon-on-insulator technology SOI device is apparent in terms of higher collector current, current gain, and cut-off frequency obtained in comparison with an all-silicon structure.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{advances in}} Si/SiO 2 -based microelectronic processing witnessed {{over the past}} several decades can largely be attributed to relatively material-independent device scaling. However, with physical and economic limitations to the continued scaling of such devices appearing on the horizon, it is likely that near-term advances will come from the integration of novel and previously underrepresented materials. One of the most promising ways to enhance performance comes from the integration of judiciously chosen lattice-mismatched materials with Si. However, the integration of such structures typically poses significant technical challenges. The work contained in this thesis seeks to address several of these important issues, primarily through the use of relaxed, graded SiGe buffers on Si (i. e. Vx[Si 1 -xGex]/Si). Several new phenomena in relaxed graded SiGe buffers are developed in this thesis. A rise in threading dislocation density was observed in high-Ge content relaxed graded SiGe layers grown at relatively high temperatures, which was attributed to dislocation nucleation. This observation is contrary to conventional graded buffer theory in which high growth temperatures are expected to result in reduced threading dislocation densities (TDDs). (cont.) Additionally, a coupling effect between the effective strain and the growth rate was observed, as evidenced by increased TDD values at reduced growth rates. This observation is attributed to reduced growth rates allowing more time for the surface to evolve (i. e. roughen) during growth, thereby trapping mobile dislocations and necessitating the nucleation of additional dislocations to continue relaxing the structure. Also detailed in this thesis is the creation of two novel CMOS-compatible platforms for high-power applications: strained-silicon on silicon (SSOS) and strained-silicon on silicon-germanium on silicon (SGOS). SSOS substrate has an epitaxially-defined, <b>tensilely</b> strained silicon (-Si) layer directly on bulk silicon wafer without an intermediate SiGe or oxide layer. SSOS is a homochemical heterojunction, i. e. a heterojunction defined by strain state only and not by an accompanying compositional change, and therefore in principle SSOS may ease metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) -Si fabrication as SiGe is absent from the structure. SGOS has an epitaxially-defined SiGe layer between the strained silicon channel and the Si substrate, which is likely necessary to prevent excessive off-state leakage in MOS devices due to overlap of the source-drain contacts and the interfacial misfit array. (cont.) The thesis concludes with a study of utilizing buried -Si layers for improving the fabrication of SSOI substrate via the hydrogen induced layer exfoliation process. Previous work involving tensile -Si. 4 Geo. 6 layers in relaxed Ge/Vx[SiixGex/Si demonstrated that significant hydrogen gettering via the formation of strain-relieving platelets occurred within the tensile -Sio. 4 Ge. 6 layers, leading to an overall increase in layer transfer efficiency for GOI substrate fabrication. Buried tensile -Si layers in relaxed SilGex for SSOI fabrication, however, demonstrate markedly different hydrogen gettering behavior that is dependent on a combination of both the degree of tensile strain as well the amount of damage present in the adjacent Si. xGex alloy. It was determined that a tensile strain level of approximately 1. 6 % in Si (corresponding to a Sio. 6 Ge. 4 -based donor structure) was needed to create sufficient engineered damage to overcome the implantation damage in the adjacent Sio. 6 Ge. 4 layers and result in enhanced layer exfoliation. Lastly, an advanced Sio. 6 Geo. 4 -based structure which incorporated -Si layers as transfer, hydrogen gettering, and etchstop layers was demonstrated. Such a structure may prove useful for the reuse of significant portions of the original SSOI donor structure, thereby potentially speeding commercial adoption of the SSOI platform. by David Michael Isaacson.
