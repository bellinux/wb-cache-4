Marge also adds the shooting {{must have been an}} accident, considering Maggie, being an infant, is very unlikely <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> operate a gun. In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may have shot Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E
5|$|Archer {{requests}} {{the coordinates}} of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, {{but he soon}} learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, since he has ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma {{in an effort to}} kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|E
5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get there.|$|E

5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven {{to ensure that the}} bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|At Mulder's apartment, Scully {{announces that}} because of Mulder's odd behavior, she {{realized}} Mulder's body contains Morris Fletcher. Scully demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> restore Mulder to his own body. Mulder's informant calls again and Scully forces Fletcher to take the call {{and set up a}} meeting. Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight data recorder in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the flight data recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes that now that Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his own body, Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without knowing where they are from or how they work.|$|E
5|$|In , Boruto joins an {{examination}} {{to improve his}} ninja rank from low status Genin to middle status Chunin with his teammates. Before the exams happened, he was training to surpass his father. For it, he becomes a student of Naruto's best friend and rival Sasuke Uchiha who first challenges him to perform the Rasengan; not knowing how, he received help from his teacher Konohamaru <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> perform it. Upon learning and mastering a small Rasengan, Boruto starts training with Sasuke after his acceptance to it. Later in the film, Boruto is told by Sasuke that he has potential of surpassing his father. In the exams, he cheats by using a device that uses ninjutsu due to his lack of training in traditional abilities. After being caught and disqualified, Naruto gets captured by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki from protecting the leaf village. Upon being scolded by Sasuke, Boruto realizes his underhandedness and joins the rescue team to save the abducted Naruto, while finally gaining his father's compliance. With the help of Naruto and Sasuke, Boruto defeats the enemy Momoshiki with his Rasengan. Although he resented the Hokage position, Boruto becomes resolute to become strong to protect his village's leader and entrust Sarada to be a future Hokage instead of himself. Boruto also reprises {{his role in the}} novel adaptation of the movie, as well as part of an omake from the manga Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend where he trains with the title character.|$|E

5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and {{wanted to have a}} good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

25|$|Some input methods are, in fact, {{related to}} the {{structure}} of the character, as opposed to those based on pronunciation. Cangjie is one popular example of such a structure based input method for Chinese. Input methods based on phonetic transcription which do not require the user <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write the character by hand are the most popular, because they are easier to use. In China, more than 97 percent of computer users enter Chinese characters using such a phonetic input method.|$|E
25|$|To {{implement}} the ideas described in previous sections, one need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> derive a computationally efficient invariant representation of an image. Such unique representation for each image {{can be characterized}} as it appears by a set of one-dimensional probability distributions (empirical distributions of the dot-products between image and a set of templates stored during unsupervised learning). These probability distributions in their turn can be described by either histograms or a set of statistical moments of it, as it will be shown below.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of labor in traditional Inuit society had a strong gender component, {{but it was not}} absolute. The men were traditionally hunters and fishermen and the women took care of the children, cleaned the home, sewed, processed food, and cooked. However, there are numerous examples of women who hunted, out of necessity or as a personal choice. At the same time men, who could be away from camp for several days at a time, would be expected <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sew and cook.|$|E

25|$|Unlike stroke-based input methods, the pinyin method only {{requires}} the user <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> speak Mandarin {{and be able}} to recognize the characters. It does not require the user to be able to construct the character from scratch as one would do in writing Chinese. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage in that {{people will be able to}} type all the characters they can recognize. It is a disadvantage in that it may cause language attrition and skill loss in adults, and it may be a learning barrier for written Chinese in children.|$|E
25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E
25|$|Short for {{electronic}} sports, are video game competitions played most by professional players individually or in teams that gained pupularity {{from the late}} 2000s, the most common genres are fighting, first-person shooter (FPS), multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) and real-time strategy. There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely one choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so {{that people in the}} area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. Major League Gaming (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for {{the fact that they have}} played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With strategy games, players tend <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.|$|E
