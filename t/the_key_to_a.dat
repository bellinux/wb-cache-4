Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a lobster trap {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present shortly before he died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> remote cabin and suggests that she leave town. When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E

25|$|Because Callisto and Ganymede are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} Titan, {{it is unclear}} why their atmospheres are insignificant relative to Titan's. Nevertheless, the origin of Titan's N2 via geologically ancient photolysis of accreted and degassed NH3, as opposed to degassing of N2 from accretionary clathrates, may be <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> correct inference. Had N2 been released from clathrates, 36Ar and 38Ar that are inert primordial isotopes of the Solar System should also {{be present in the}} atmosphere, but neither has been detected in significant quantities. The insignificant concentration of 36Ar and 38Ar also indicates that the ~40K temperature required to trap them and N2 in clathrates did not exist in the Saturnian subnebula. Instead, the temperature may have been higher than 75K, limiting even the accumulation of NH3 as hydrates. Temperatures would have been even higher in the Jovian subnebula due to the greater gravitational potential energy release, mass, and proximity to the Sun, greatly reducing the NH3 inventory accreted by Callisto and Ganymede. The resulting N2 atmospheres may have been too thin to survive the atmospheric erosion effects that Titan has withstood.|$|E
