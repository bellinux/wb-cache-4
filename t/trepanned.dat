2500|$|In ancient times, holes were drilled into {{a person}} who was {{behaving}} in what was considered an abnormal way to let out what they believed were evil spirits. Evidence of trepanation has been found in prehistoric human remains from Neolithic times onward. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and mental disorders. The bone that was <b>trepanned</b> was kept by the prehistoric people and may have been worn as a charm to keep evil spirits away. [...] Evidence also suggests that trepanation was primitive emergency surgery after head wounds to remove shattered bits of bone from a fractured skull and clean out the blood that often pools under the skull after a blow to the head. [...] Such injuries were typical for primitive weaponry such as slings and war clubs. There is some contemporary use of the term. [...] In modern eye surgery, a trephine instrument is used in corneal transplant surgery. The procedure of drilling a hole through a fingernail or toenail is also known as trephination. It is performed by a physician or surgeon to relieve the pain associated with a subungual hematoma (blood under the nail); a small amount of blood is expressed through the hole and the pain associated with the pressure is partially alleviated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In laser {{materials}} processing, <b>trepanning</b> optics {{are used}} to fabricate laser drilled holes of high aspect ratios (> 10) and controllable drill-hole 1 conicity. However, <b>trepanning</b> optics available up to today are limited to circular <b>trepanning</b> geometries. Thus, only circular holes with drill-hole wall angles of rotational symmetry are feasible. Within this paper we will present a novel <b>trepanning</b> optic based on two piezo-actuatoric tip/tilt mirrors, being first of its kind, which allows arbitrary developments of propagation angle and lateral position of the laser beam, both being independent of each other. Consequently, the novel <b>trepanning</b> optic allows arbitrary drill-hole geometries such as circular, elliptical, rectangular etc. At {{the same time the}} drill-hole wall angle may be varied freely. Thus, asymmetric drill-hole wall angles are feasible such as tilt of the drill hole or wobbling of the drill-hole wall angle for instance. Demonstrative drill-holes of different shapes produced with an ultrashort pulsed laser prove the flexibility of the <b>trepanning</b> optic presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{limitation of}} neural networks {{is that the}} representations they learn are usually incomprehensible to humans. We have developed an algorithm, called <b>Trepan,</b> for extracting comprehensible, symbolic representations from trained neural networks.

40|$|<b>TREPAN</b> is {{decision}} tree algorithm that utilises artificial neural networks (ANNs) {{in order to}} improve partitioning conditions when sample data is sparse. When sample sizes are limited during the tree-induction process, <b>TREPAN</b> relies on an ANN oracle in order to create artificial sample instances. The original <b>TREPAN</b> implementation was limited to ANNs that were designed to be classification models. In other words, <b>TREPAN</b> was incapable of building {{decision tree}}s from ANN models that were continuous in nature. Thus, the objective of this research was to modify the original implementation of <b>TREPAN</b> in order to develop and test decision trees derived from continuous-based ANN models. Though the modification were minor, they are significant because it provides researchers and practitioners an additional strategy to extract knowledge from a trained ANN regardless of its design. This research also explores how TEPAN's adjustable settings influence predictive performances based on a dataset's complexity and size. multi-class classification; decision trees; artificial neural networks; ANNs; TREPAN; C 4. 5; multilayer perceptron; MLP; generalised feed-forward; GFF; modular networks; genetic algorithms; techniques; strategies; continuous oracle; data analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation into the effect of the geometry of a <b>trepanning</b> tool on thrust and torque during the drilling of uni-directional glass fibre-reinforced plastic (UD-GFRP) laminates. It is well-known that the most effective way of achieving good quality holes while drilling fibre-reinforced plastics (FRPs) is by reducing the thrust and torque. Therefore, this investigation was aimed at exploring the possibility of reducing the thrust and torque by using the concept of <b>trepanning.</b> The design considerations and development methodology of the <b>trepanning</b> tool are discussed. The appropriate tool geometry has been determined by using statistically planned experiments and analysis. Orthogonal arrays with analysis of means as well as analysis of variance have been used to assess individual factor and interaction effects and their significance levels. The investigations have revealed that the performance of the <b>trepanning</b> tool is superior to that of conventional twist drills in terms of thrust, torque and hole quality. Low production cost and ease of regrinding are its major additional advantages due to its simple geometry. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. ...|$|R
