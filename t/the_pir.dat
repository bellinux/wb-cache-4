25|$|The {{movement}} was also hit by defections as party members switched sides {{out of fear}} or for benefit. Those members that wished to survive politically rallied behind a former ally, turned opponent of Qayyum Khan, <b>the</b> <b>Pir</b> of Manki Sharif. <b>The</b> <b>Pir</b> created a breakaway Muslim League, however, it proved no match for Qayyum who engineered his re-election in 1951.|$|E
25|$|The {{six years}} {{preceding}} the 1952 National Revolution {{are known as}} the sexenio. During this period, members of the Conservative Party tried to stem {{the growth of the}} left, but they ultimately failed, because they could not halt the economic decline and control the growing social unrest. Enrique Hertzog Garaizabal (1947–49), who was elected president in 1947 after the interim rule of a provisional junta, formed a coalition cabinet that included not only the concordancia but also <b>the</b> <b>PIR.</b> He hoped to retain the backing of the Conservative Party forces by not increasing taxes, but he tried also to gain labor support, relying on <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> to mobilize the workers.|$|E
25|$|From 1963 NCO {{and junior}} officer ranks {{began to be}} filled with {{indigenous}} personnel, with junior officers being trained at the Officer Cadet School at Portsea in Victoria. By 1970 there were 30 PNG officers serving in <b>the</b> <b>PIR.</b> Regardless until independence in 1975 the regiment was controlled from Australia, with no local influence or command, a situation which occasionally caused ill feeling towards <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> from PNG citizens who were increasingly moving into positions of authority in the lead-up to independence. In January 1973 military units in Papua New Guinea were re-designated the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, while formal defence powers were subsequently transferred in March 1975.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to operations in Malaysia, Australian troops patrolled the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border during the confrontation. These operations {{were conducted by}} the Pacific Islands Regiment (PIR), which was an Australian Army formation manned by native New Guineans and led by Australian officers and warrant officers. Although {{there was only one}} shooting incident between <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> and Indonesian troops, a number of incursions took place and these patrols–which were often conducted in rugged terrain–placed considerable demands on Australia's already limited defence resources. <b>The</b> <b>PIR</b> was also expanded from one to two battalions in 1963 in response to the increased threat posed by Indonesia, though a third battalion authorised in 1964 was not formed. Other precautions included the construction and upgrading of a number of airfields in Papua New Guinea for use by the RAAF.|$|E
25|$|During the Indonesia-Malaysia {{confrontation}} (1962–66) {{the regiment}} patrolled the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border {{and although there}} was only one shooting incident between <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> and Indonesian troops, a number of incursions took place and these patrols—which were often conducted in rugged terrain—placed considerable demands on Australia's already limited defence resources. Amid growing Australian concern about Indonesian intentions <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> began training for guerilla operations, and in September 1963 a second battalion was authorised, subsequently being raised in 1965. A third battalion, although proposed on a number of occasions, was never formed. The strength of regiment rose to 185 Australians and 1,188 PNG soldiers. Papua New Guinea Command was subsequently formed in 1965, thereby ending the link with Headquarters Northern Command in Brisbane. Meanwhile, a proposal to send a rifle company to fight in Vietnam was resisted by the Australian Army.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the war more than 3,500 Papuans and New Guineans served in the ranks of <b>the</b> <b>PIR,</b> {{suffering}} casualties (both Europeans and natives) of 65 killed, 16 missing, 75 died of other causes, and 81 wounded. Losses inflicted on the Japanese included 2,201 killed, 110 probably killed, 118 wounded and 196 captured. The regiment was officially disbanded on 24 June 1946.|$|E

25|$|While some Alevis do not {{recognize}} an obligation to go on pilgrimage to Mecca (and some do, but not according to Sunni orthodox rituals), performing ziyarat and du'a at the tombs of Alevi-Bektashi saints or pirs is quite common. Some {{of the most frequently}} visited sites are the shrines of Şahkulu and Karacaahmet (both in Istanbul), Abdal Musa (Antalya), Battal Gazi (Eskişehir), the annual celebrations held at Hacıbektaş (16 August) and Sivas (<b>the</b> <b>Pir</b> Sultan Abdal Kültür Etkinlikleri, 23–24 June).|$|E
25|$|The labor sector did not {{cooperate}} {{with the government and}} <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> became discredited because of its alliance with the conservative forces. In 1946 the workers endorsed the Thesis of Pulacayo, in which the miners called for permanent revolution and violent armed struggle for the working class. As the labor sector became more radical, the government resorted more and more to oppression, and confrontations increased. The dismissal of 7,000 miners and the brutal suppression of yet another uprising in Catavi in 1949 made any cooperation {{between the government and the}} workers impossible.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 {{when the}} Pentropic {{division}} was {{introduced into the}} Australian Army, PIR remained the only infantry battalion organised on the old establishment. Meanwhile, a further outbreak of indiscipline occurred in January 1961, this time over discriminatory pay scales. Although the disaffected soldiers were largely removed, pay scales were increased, and {{efforts were made to}} break up the regional and tribal concentrations of soldiers within subunits. In 1961 <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> was awarded the battle honours of the PIB and NGIBs. By 1962 the battalion numbered 75 Australians (officers and SNCOs) and 660 PNG soldiers.|$|E

25|$|It was envisioned that <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> {{would have}} four roles in war-time: garrisoning Manus Island {{and other similar}} areas; patrolling the land border with Dutch New Guinea (later Indonesian West Irian); and acting as a delaying force if required; and {{providing}} detachments for Australian units deployed to PNG. One company was based at Port Moresby, while others were based at outstations at Vanimo (from October 1952), Los Negros (1954, but later abandoned for Cape Moem), and at Kokopo. The establishment of the regiment was initially limited to 600 men.|$|E
25|$|In December 1957 riots {{broke out}} in Port Moresby between {{soldiers}} and civilian, {{which had to be}} broken up by police. Ultimately 153 soldiers were fined and 15 discharged, while 117 civilians were also convicted. As a result of this incident the organisation of <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> was reviewed and henceforth Australian officers would be required to serve between four and six years with the regiment, and a number would be returned as senior officers later in their careers, thereby avoiding the previous situation in which officers with little experience serving with PNG soldiers would be posted to the regiment.|$|E
25|$|Both the aluminium-polyethylene {{cladding}} and <b>the</b> <b>PIR</b> insulation plates failed {{fire safety}} tests conducted after the fire, {{according to the}} police. In 2014 safety experts cautioned that the planned insulation was only suitable for use with non-combustible cladding. The Guardian saw a certificate from the building inspectors’ organisation, Local Authority Building Control (LABC), which stated that the chosen insulation for the refit should be used on tall buildings only with fibre cement panels, which do not burn. Combustible panels with polyethylene were put {{up on top of}} insulation known as Celotex RS5000, made from polyisocyanurate, which burns when heated giving off toxic cyanide fumes.|$|E

25|$|Just as the Imām {{is seen by}} Ismailis as {{the manifestation}} of the first-created Light, during the period between the Imāmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the {{relationship}} between the teacher and the student became a sacred one, and the Dai became a position much beyond a normal missionary. The Dai passed on the sacred and hidden knowledge of the Imām to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First the student loved the Dai, and from the Dai he learned to love the Imām, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called <b>the</b> <b>Pir.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Harjinder Dilgeer {{there was}} no Pathan in the Guru's army, and story of Pir Budhu Shah sending his sons is a later concoction. Pir Budhu Shah was at Sadhaura, about 60km from Paonta; it was not {{possible}} for him to receive the news of betrayal by Pathan soldiers. Even if it is accepted, there is no explanation for how he could get the news the same day and dispatch his son from Sadhaura to Bhangani: it would mean that the battle continued for several days. Thus, he concludes that Pir Budhu Shah's story is a concoction; however, {{there is no doubt that}} Pir was an admirer of the Guru and for this 'crime' Usman Khan the chief of Sadhaura had punished (killed) <b>the</b> <b>Pir</b> and his two sons.|$|E
25|$|Bektashism is also initiatic {{and members}} must {{traverse}} various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual {{path to the}} Reality. First level members are called aşıks عاشق. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called nasip) one becomes a mühip محب. After some time as a mühip, one can take further vows and become a dervish. The next level above dervish is that of baba. The baba (lit. father) {{is considered to be}} the head of a tekke and qualified to give spiritual guidance (irshad إرشاد). Above the baba is the rank of halife-baba (or dede, grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the dedebaba (great-grandfather). The dedebaba was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the dedebaba was <b>the</b> <b>Pir</b> Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hacıbektaş (Solucakarahüyük).|$|E
50|$|On 20 August 2012 Padalka, {{together}} with cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, participated in his ninth career spacewalk. Tasks {{assigned to the}} two cosmonauts included hardware relocations, installations, retrievals, and deployments. For the spacewalk, Malenchenko donned an Orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe. The duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes. The spacewalk was delayed {{for about an hour}} due to a small leak between Space Station modules. The spacewalk started from <b>the</b> <b>Pirs</b> Docking Compartment Module at 15:37 GMT. The first task for Padalka and Malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from <b>the</b> <b>Pirs</b> module to <b>the</b> forward end of the Zarya module. The relocation was needed since Pirs module will be detached from the Space Station in the future for the arrival of the new Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM) Nauka. The next task completed by Padalka and Malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite. The two cosmonauts also retrieved five debris shields from <b>the</b> <b>Pirs</b> Module, prior to installing them on the Zvezda Module. They also completed several get-ahead tasks (since the both opted not to take rests during the night passes) as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline. They retrieved an external experiment called Biorisk from <b>the</b> <b>Pirs</b> Module for return to Earth, and for added stability installed two structural support struts between <b>the</b> <b>Pirs</b> Module and <b>the</b> EVA ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko then both ingressed <b>the</b> <b>Pirs</b> Module, prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure, to end a successful spacewalk.|$|R

25|$|Within Afghanistan, the Astor markhor {{is limited}} to the east in the high and mountainous monsoon forests of Laghman and Nuristan. In India, this {{subspecies}} is restricted to a portion of <b>the</b> <b>Pir</b> Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir. Throughout this range, Astor markhor populations are scattered, starting east of the Banihal Pass (50km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Recent surveys indicate it still occurs in catchments of the Limber and Lachipora Rivers in the Jhelum Valley Forest Division, and around Shupiyan to the south of Srinagar. In Pakistan, the Astor markhor there is restricted to the Indus and its tributaries, {{as well as to the}} Kunar (Chitral) River and its tributaries. Along the Indus, it inhabits both banks from Jalkot (Kohistan District) upstream to near the Tungas village (Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit up the Gilgit River, Chalt up the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley up the Astore River. It has been said to occur on the right side of the Yasin Valley (Gilgit District), though this is unconfirmed. The flare-horned markhor is also found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan, where it inhabits a number of valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River. The largest population is currently found in Chitral National Park in Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|Remote {{regions of}} Jammu and Kashmir such as Baramulla {{district}} {{in the east and}} <b>the</b> <b>Pir</b> Panjal Range in the southeast experience exceptionally heavy snowfall.

In the hot season, Jammu city is very hot and can reach up to 40°C (104°F) while in July and August, very heavy—though erratic—rainfall occurs with monthly extremes of up to [...] Rainfall declines in September; by October conditions are extremely dry, with temperatures of around 29°C (84°F). Across from <b>the</b> <b>Pir</b> Panjal range, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a factor and most precipitation falls in the spring from southwestern cloudbands. Because of its closeness to the Arabian Sea, Srinagar receives as much as 25inches (635mm) of rain from this source, with the wettest months being March to May with around 85mm (3.3inches) per month.|$|E
