The premier introduced electoral legislation that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> The LCL relied on Stott in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a pair.|$|E

5|$|The {{huntingtin}} protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function.

5|$|Voalavo is a genus of rodent in the {{subfamily}} Nesomyinae, {{found only}} in Madagascar. Two species are known, both of which occur in mountain forest above 1250m (4100ft) altitude; the northern voalavo lives in northern Madagascar and eastern voalavo is restricted to a small area in {{the central part of}} the island. The genus was discovered in 1994 and formally described in 1998. Within Nesomyinae, it is most closely related to the genus Eliurus, and DNA sequence data suggest that the current definitions of these two genera need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{different}} {{components of a}} scene were finished, the team at Bones created its layout art; this included things such as determining the camera position throughout the scene and how movements would be done. The developers wanted to focus on how the characters' faces were drawn and animated, {{and make sure that}} the characters matched their respective in-game 3D models, so Fuse gave detailed feedback on the layouts, and drew over them in red to indicate what he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> These changes included corrections to off-model drawings, facial expressions, body postures, and character acting. Once the layouts had been approved, the animators drew the key animation, after which the in-between frames were drawn. Once the animated footage was completed, it was put together and rendered in stereoscopic 3D. Voice acting, music, sound effects, sound leveling and remixing was then done, and added to the cutscene.|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E

There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers of the protest.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Scavino, {{social media}} {{director}} for Trump's presidential campaign began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a caddie in 2009, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to {{general manager of}} the club after Trump's purchase. In December 2016, he was announced as Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media. Trump's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election affected the club; Horace Greeley High School used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate. The location for the 2016 prom has yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by student decision. In the following year, it was reported that Pleasantville High School's graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well. The graduating class voted, 97-44, to keep the venue. On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the Republican primaries.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|From 1 to 31 May 1924, the Royal Air Force {{conducted}} {{a number of}} night flying experiments. Pilots were asked to keep an extra lookout whilst the experiments were taking place. On 27 and 28 September, the elimination trials for the Light Aircraft Trials were held. Only eight aircraft passed through to the trials proper. Also in October, it was notified that changes were being made expanding weather information given at Lympne. Amongst the changes were that measurements used were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> from imperial to metric. The addition of weather information at Haren, Brussels and Ostend, both in Belgium was notified. In 1924, Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft were operating cross-channel services for Imperial Airways. Lympne was used by aircraft of Imperial Airways as a refuelling point. The first stop in France was St Inglevert. When an aircraft departed Lympne for St Inglevert, the destination airfield was advised, and if arrival was not notified within two hours, the Coastguard was informed. Communication was by Carmichael Microway UHF transmitters at each airfield. Short Brothers used Lympne for flight testing new aircraft during 1924.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC.

5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{made it a}} clean {{sweep of}} fastest times in {{practice}} on Saturday morning, setting a time of 1:30.904, again less than {{a tenth of a}} second ahead of Rosberg. The session started in wet conditions following a rain shower thirty minutes before it commenced. It was interrupted with 22 minutes to go, after Marcus Ericsson crashed heavily at the exit of Stowe corner. With the car cleared from the track, lengthy repair work at the barriers followed, leaving just five minutes of running when practice was restarted. The drivers then set their fastest times of the session. Again, it were the Red Bull drivers closest to the Mercedes, with Ricciardo ahead of Verstappen in third, both about half a second off Hamilton's time. Ericsson was sent to hospital for tests following his accident and received a five-place grid penalty since his gearbox had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> Vettel received the same penalty after his gearbox failed {{towards the end of the}} third practice session.|$|E
5|$|Odex {{blamed the}} {{approximate}} 70% fall in its Video CD (VCD) and Digital Video Disc (DVD) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading. The response of anime fans {{was that the}} fall in sales was because Odex's products were inferior, inaccurately translated, and released later than the online versions. Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed,</b> that it merely classified content, and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations. Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) in making its demands for compensation.|$|E
