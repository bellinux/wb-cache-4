5|$|Although {{the game}} has {{interrogation}} sequences involving questioning (or torturing) targets, {{it does not have}} Conviction interactive torture scenes. Players can still decide whether to spare <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> or kill them after interrogation, and these decisions influence the relationship between Fisher and other crew members.|$|E

5|$|Navy strikes were {{launched}} from the aircraft carriers of Task Force 77, cruising off the North Vietnamese coast at Yankee Station.

They predict this target based on gut feeling rather than calculation. The Lumina manages to jump 22 feet beyond <b>their</b> <b>target.</b> Team 1 uses the Sunfire, also at 65 km/h but with a 32-inch ramp height, and place <b>their</b> <b>target</b> 63 {{feet in front of}} the ramp; their car falls 25 feet short of <b>their</b> <b>target.</b> Dave volunteers to put himself in the Danger Zone.|$|R

5|$|As Bode was {{in action}} at Poling, Alfons Orthofer's unit {{attacked}} Ford. There were only six Lewis machine guns manned at Ford and the Ju 87s {{were able to}} attack with complete confidence. Bombs rained down on huts, hangars, building and amongst aircraft drawn up together for maintenance. Early on bombs struck the field's oil tanks and storage compounds causing an enormous blaze which contributed to the crippling damage on the airfield. Gosport also came under attack soon after. Siegel's Ju 87s, with no air opposition, swooped onto <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> causing large-scale damage.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00 448 B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces, {{having already}} {{completed}} one bombing mission over Omaha late the previous day, returned. However, with the skies overcast and under orders to avoid bombing the troops which were by then approaching the beach, the bombers overshot <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> {{and only three}} bombs fell near the beach area.|$|E

5|$|Croatian forces adapted several Antonov An-2 biplanes to drop {{supplies}} by parachute on Vukovar. The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel {{cans and}} boilers filled with explosive and metal bars. The crews used GPS to locate <b>their</b> <b>targets,</b> then pushed ordinance {{through the side}} door. One of the aircraft was shot down by an SA-6 missile, killing Marko Živković, {{the commander of the}} air unit.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers {{with the ability}} to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter this threat, Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached <b>their</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Innis's {{role as an}} {{artillery}} signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) {{on the front lines}} as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on Vimy Ridge. Signallers, or spotters, watched where each artillery shell landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.|$|E

She spotted a tanker escorted by a destroyer and Hashimoto ordered her to launch two kaitens at 14:31 and 14:43. She heard explosions at 15:21 and 15:31 but her crew was unable to determine if the kaitens had struck <b>their</b> <b>targets.</b> Hashimoto reported a tanker assumed sunk.|$|E
5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and ballistic missiles. The ballistic missiles would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> and that the ballistic missiles would need three hours of preparation time.|$|E

The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called macromolecular crowding, which is when the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol. It is particularly important {{in its ability to}} alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> in the genome.|$|E

40|$|Chemopreventive drugs {{including}} natural chemopreventive {{drugs and}} synthetic chemopreventive drugs, {{it not only}} can prevent cancer, can {{also play a role}} in tumor treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) is a kind of short chains of non-coding RNA, regulating the expression of many genes through the way of degradation of mRNA or inhibitting mRNA translation. In recent years, more and more studies have shown that chemopreventive drugs through influence the expression of miRNAs and <b>their</b> <b>target</b> genes {{play a role in the}} prevention and treatment in a variety of tumors, and chemopreventive drugs on the experimental study of miRNAs and <b>their</b> <b>target</b> genes in tumor have demonstrated a good safety and efficacy. Effect on chemopreventive drugs-based microRNAs and <b>their</b> <b>target</b> genes into cancer cells will be expected as a new starting point for cancer research.

5|$|ZG 26's Bf 110s {{were flying}} near the formation, {{and tried to}} offer JG 3 support by intercepting Crossley's fighters but failed. Crossley led a head-on attack and downed one Do 17 while his {{squadron}} damaged several others. So close had the RAF fighters pressed home their attacks that the bombers had to move and jink to avoid their fire. It put the bomb-aimers off their aim. The Dorniers were already too close to <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> and the pilots could not realign before the formation was over and passed the aiming point. Having been thwarted from bombing their official targets they aimed for rail tracks {{to the north and}} east of the airfield. Some of the unit targeted RAF Croydon, three miles north-west of Biggin Hill. Others turned around without releasing their bombs. The crews that bombed the rail lines found they were a difficult target to hit at 15,000 feet. Some released their bombs at intervals in the hope of hitting <b>their</b> <b>targets,</b> however some bombs fell on residential property.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{proved that}} the fault lay {{in the construction of}} the bomb's tail; breaking up on impact, a 'safed' bomb would have its arming wire removed, rendering it 'unsafe' and detonating the weapon. Modifications were made to solve the problem, but the damage had been done; the safety issues, increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs, the fact that the bomb's guidance system required clear-day use only, rendering the bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters, and required that the weapon be released at a prime altitude for the aircraft to be in danger from enemy flak. These combined with the weapon's poor reliability – only six of twenty-eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed <b>their</b> <b>targets</b> – to result in the production order being canceled by the USAF; following this, the Tarzon program as a whole was terminated in August 1951.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of <b>their</b> <b>targets.</b> An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
