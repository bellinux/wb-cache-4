50|$|Human sex ratios, {{either at}} birth {{or in the}} {{population}} as a whole, are reported in any of four ways: the ratio of males <b>to</b> <b>females,</b> the ratio of <b>females</b> <b>to</b> males, the proportion of males, or the proportion of females. If there are 108,000 males and 100,000 females the ratio of males <b>to</b> <b>females</b> is 1.080 and the proportion of males is 51.9%. Scientific literature often uses the proportion of males.

The ratio of live males <b>to</b> <b>females</b> at birth (normal, 107 males <b>to</b> 100 <b>females)</b> is apparently reduced with abdominal pregnancy to as low as 60 males <b>to</b> 100 <b>females</b> (as reported by Masukume) because males {{are more likely to}} die in harsh environments (for example in abdominal pregnancy) compared <b>to</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment.

In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male <b>to</b> <b>female</b> migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E

A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male <b>to</b> <b>female</b> ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause.

The organization also helps both women and men seeking to overcome pornography addiction.|$|E

50|$|Steller {{sea lions}} have {{exhibited}} multiple competitive strategies for reproductive success. Sea lion mating is often polygamous as males usually mate with different <b>females</b> <b>to</b> increase fitness and success, leaving some males to {{not find a}} mate at all. Polygamous males rarely provide parental care towards the pup. Strategies used <b>to</b> monopolize <b>females</b> include the resource-defense polygyny, or occupying important female resources. This involves occupying and defending a territory with resources or features attractive <b>to</b> <b>females</b> during sexually receptive periods. Some of these factors may include pupping habitat and access to water. Other techniques include potentially limiting access of other males <b>to</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

The catching was conducted in three periods, ie. : April 2001, April 2002, and April 2004. The results were as follows: (1) The number of females caught at each periode was much more than males. The ratio of males <b>to</b> <b>females</b> was 1 : 2; (2) The ratios of males <b>to</b> <b>females</b> at three successive periodes were significantly different at p â‰¥ 5. The ratios vary due to the influence of several factor, outside the temperature of the environment, on the ratios of males <b>to</b> <b>females</b> in Drosophila. ...|$|R
