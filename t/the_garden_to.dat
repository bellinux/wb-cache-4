5|$|Viva Piñata is a first-person life {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player restores and tends to a neglected garden on Piñata Island. The player uses gardening tools, such as shovels and watering cans, to plough their garden, sow seeds, create ponds, and sculpt <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> their liking. When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a black-and-white outline of a given piñata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E
5|$|The {{first book}} in Blyton's Barney Mysteries series, The Rockingdown Mystery, was {{published}} in 1949, as {{was the first of}} her fifteen Secret Seven novels. The Secret Seven Society consists of Peter, his sister Janet, and their friends Colin, George, Jack, Pam and Barbara, who meet regularly in a shed in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> discuss peculiar events in their local community. Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons, which appeared in Mickey Mouse Weekly in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook. The French author Evelyne Lallemand continued the series in the 1970s, producing an additional twelve books, nine of which were translated into English by Anthea Bell between 1983 and 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 1858/59 Inselstraße was {{extended}} through <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> connect Köpenicker Straße {{to the city}} centre, and the Lodge was forced to sell the larger, eastern portion of the site to the city. The Köllnisches Gymnasium was then built there. How to use {{the remainder of the}} site was discussed for years; a desire to preserve the trees led to the rejection of several commercial proposals. On 15 April 1869, the Assembly of City Deputies (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) decided to establish a public playground (probably one of the first in the city) and 'promenade location' there on plans drawn up by the first city director of gardens, Gustav Meyer, dedicated the necessary funds, and urged rapid execution of the plan. The plan involved some new plantings, fencing, and benches. This renovation was completed in 1873. The park reached its current dimensions in 1883 after the ditch was filled in. Ludwig Hoffmann, the architect of the Märkisches Museum (completed in 1907), then made some changes including creating views across the park to the new museum. The last major modification of the park took place in 196971 to designs by Eberhard Jaenisch, Stefan Rauner and Roswitha Schulz: a mound which remained {{on the site of the}} bastion was levelled, a children's playground was added, a terrace was built behind the museum, and the Lapidary was created.|$|E

5|$|Tree {{of heaven}} {{is a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions. It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive {{as it is in}} America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E

25|$|These {{ornamental}} gardens {{were probably}} {{laid out in}} the early 19th century as a peaceful retreat for the family. The gardens have recently been returned to their original design with pools, summerhouses and plants appropriate to the period. A tunnel leads from the flowergarden to the dell and carries a causeway at high level across the gardens to allow the cattle, from the fields to the south of <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>to</b> be taken to the farm for milking without entering the gardens. The tunnel entrance is faced with large stones to give it the appearance of a natural cave.|$|E

25|$|The Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Zoological and Botanical centres in the world. It is located on the {{northern}} slope of Victoria Peak and has been opened to the public since 1862. In 1871, it was officially renamed to Botanical Gardens, and in 1975, the name was changed again to Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens. This venerable park was previously named Bing Tao Garden, meaning the Chief Commander's Garden. It was then linked to the garden of the Government House. In 1941, a bronze statue of King George VI was erected in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> mark the centenary year in which Hong Kong became a British Colony.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years after}} the {{execution}} of the Báb, three Bábís, acting on their own initiative, attempted to assassinate Nasser-al-Din Shah as he was returning from the chase to his palace at Niyávarfin. The attempt failed, but was the cause of a fresh persecution of the Bábís and Táhirih was blamed due to her Bábí faith. She was told shortly beforehand about her execution. Táhirih kissed the hands of the messenger, dressed herself in bridal attire, adorned herself in perfume and said her prayers. To the wife of Mahmud Khan she made one supplication: that she be left in peace to continue her prayers in peace. The young son of Mahmud Khan accompanied Táhirih to <b>the</b> <b>garden.</b> <b>To</b> him she gave a silk white handkerchief with which she had chosen to be strangled.|$|E
25|$|In Sri Lanka, food offerings {{are made}} to the hungry ghosts on the seventh day, as a ceremony, after death as part of {{traditional}} Sri Lankan funeral rites and is known as mataka dānēs. This offering comes a day after personalized food offerings are given in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> {{the spirit of the}} deceased relative, which occurs on the sixth day. The deceased who do not reach the proper afterworld, the Hungry Ghost realm, are feared by the living as they are believed to cause various sicknesses and disasters to the living. Buddhist monks are called upon to perform pirit to ward off the floating spirits. The rite is also practiced in Thailand and Myanmar and is also practiced during the Ghost Festival that is observed in other Asian countries.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} the Cadbury-Browns had a holiday home near the Suffolk town of Aldeburgh. Cadbury-Brown had {{designed}} a studio for Benjamin Britten {{in the early}} days of the Aldeburgh Festival and Britten had acquired a site opposite the parish church to build an opera house upon it. When this idea did not come to fruition, Britten converted the maltings at Snape and Cadbury-Brown bought the site. Seeing that the site already had a single storey dwelling on it he knew that it had potential and together with his wife they designed a new home. After the house was completed in 1964 he sold part of <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> Britten's colleague, the musician Imogen Holst and designed a house for her too. In 2000 the original house was Grade 2 Listed.|$|E
25|$|The North-West University Botanical Garden {{fulfills}} many key functions {{within the}} North-West University most notably supporting {{the training of}} students and research. Even though horticulture is not taught at the North-West University, an internship program funded by AgriSETA was started in 2011 to give young horticulturalists a chance to gain valuable practical experience. Besides the academic functions the Botanical Garden is also involved with conservation efforts of numerous threatened indigenous plant species particularly threatened species endemic to the North West Province of South Africa. In 2008 the Botanical Garden signed up to the International Agenda for Botanic Gardens in Conservation that commits <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the 16 conservation targets {{set out in the}} Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). The Garden has made many contributions towards species conservation most notably in 2011 when the Garden donated seeds of a newly discovered and already threatened monotypic species, Prototulbaghia siebertii, to the Millennium Seed Bank Project.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the Taj Mahal complex, across the river is another Charbagh garden, Mahtab Bagh. It was {{designed}} {{as an integral part of}} the complex in the riverfront terrace pattern seen elsewhere in Agra. Its width is identical to that of the rest of the Taj. The garden historian Elizabeth Moynihan suggests the large octagonal pool in the centre of the terrace would reflect the image of the Mausoleum and thus the garden would provide a setting to view the Taj Mahal. The garden has been beset by flooding from the river since Mughal times. As a result, the condition of the remaining structures is quite ruinous. Four sandstone towers marked the corners of the garden, only the south-eastward one remains. The foundations of two structures remain immediately north and south of the large pool which were probably garden pavilions. From the northern structure a stepped waterfall would have fed the pool. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> the north has the typical square, cross-axial plan with a square pool in its centre. To the west an aqueduct fed the garden.|$|E

25|$|The Villa del Pastore {{dates from}} between the eighth century BC and 79 AD. It {{is divided into two}} parts: a large outdoor area and a series of {{residential}} rooms. The garden area is bordered to the south by the semicircular wall, while on the north is a 140m long cryptoporticus which runs parallel to a colonnade on a slightly lower level. At the centre of the garden is a swimming pool (natatio) with marble staircase. In the centre of the semicircular alcove was found the statue that gives the villa its name, of marble, 65cm tall in Hellenistic style and is an old shepherd dressed in hides, carrying on his shoulders a kid, with a basket with grapes and bread on his left hand while in the right hand is a hare. Also in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> the south west is a porch 10x2m portico paved with black and white mosaic.

25|$|At {{approximately}} 8.20am on 22 September 1989, the Royal Marines School of Music at the Royal Marine Depot, Deal {{was bombed}} by the IRA; {{this resulted in}} the death of eleven Royal Marines Musicians - Musn Mick Ball, B/Cpl John (Andy) Cleatheroe, B/Cpl Trevor Davis, Musn Richard Fice, Musn Richard (Taff) Jones, B/Cpl Dave McMillan, Musn Chris Nolan, B/Cpl Dean Pavey, Musn Mark Petch, Musn Tim Reeves and Musn Bob Simmonds plus the injury of 22 other Royal Marine Band Service members. A memorial garden is now situated in the grounds of the old barracks where the bomb went off. This was built in remembrance of the eleven who died and was restored after an arson attack some years later. Every year the families and friends of those that died join together at <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>to</b> pay their respects and lay flowers in a memorial service. The Bandstand near the Walmer Lifeboat station is also dedicated to those who lost their lives in the bombing, with the names of those killed engraved on each face.
