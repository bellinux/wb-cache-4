40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} speakers' first language (L 1) dialect affects <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> word-final stops which are phonetically unreleased in Vietnamese. Furthermore, a /t/-/k/ merger has been reported for the Southern, but not the Northern dialect. Given this cross-dialectal phonetic difference, we tested the hypothesis that the stops produced by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern dialect are identified less accurately than those produced by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern dialect. The results showed that the speakers' dialect influenced the extent to which final stops are accurately identified and, in general, for all five vowels tested the stops spoken by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern dialect were more accurately identified than those spoken by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern dialect. However, <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> stop place identification depended on <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding vowels. 16 page(s...|$|R

5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties {{for a longer period of}} time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E

In those circumstances, new legislation is countersigned by the prime minister instead {{of the president and}} a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman on 10 December 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president. After the parliamentary elections of 2000, the role was transferred to Zlatko Tomčić, who filled the office until Stjepan Mesić was elected President of Croatia in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament may recall the Government as a whole or {{any member of the}} Government in particular by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister {{and other members of the}} Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E
