40|$|On this fifteeth {{day of the}} STS- 90 mission, {{the flight}} crew, Cmdr. Richard A. Searfoss, Pilot Scott D. Altman, and Mission Specialists Richard M. Linnehan, Dafydd Rhys Williams and Kathryn P. Hire, <b>and</b> <b>Payload</b> Specialists Jay C. Buckey and James A. Pawelczyk turns its {{attention}} to dexterity tests and dissections of rats neonates and the ball-catch experiment. Mission Specialists Rick Linnehan and Dave Williams <b>and</b> <b>Payload</b> Specialist Jim Pawelczyk will dissect the newborn rats. The dexterity test will test the response of young rats as they are <b>tilted</b> <b>and</b> turned while walking and climbing on a special apparatus with various surfaces. Later, all four payload crew members will repeat the ball-catch experiment. This experiment studies {{the ability of the}} central nervous system to accept and interpret new stimuli in space. The astronauts have performed this test at various points in the mission so scientists can compare their responses as their bodies adapt to weightlessness...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Control {{issues are}} {{investigated}} for a parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> system with {{left and right}} parafoil brakes used as the control mechanism. It is shown through dynamic modeling and simulation that parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> systems can exhibit two basic modes of lateral control, namely, roll and skid steering. Using a small parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> aircraft, glide rates and turn performance were measured and compared against a 9 DOF simulation model. This work shows that to properly capture control response of parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> aircraft, <b>tilt</b> of the parafoil canopy must be accounted for along with left and right parafoil brake deflection. Alternative methods of controlling a parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> by <b>tilting</b> the canopy for lateral control and changing rigging angle for longitudinal control are evaluated. A model predictive control strategy is developed for an autonomous parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> system. It is demonstrated in flight tests that a model predictive control strategy is a natural and effective method of achieving trajectory tracking in a parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> system...|$|R
40|$|By {{presenting}} oriented Gabor patches either monocularly or binocularly, we dissociated retinal orientation from perceived <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> perceived slant. After {{adapting to}} binocular patches, with zero apparent <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> non-zero slant, small <b>tilt</b> after-effects (TAEs) <b>and</b> large slant after-effects (SAE) were measured. Adapting to monocular patches with non-zero <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> zero slant produced large TAEs and smaller SAEs. This {{pattern of results}} suggests that a common, low-level adaptation to monocular orientation is involved in slant <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> after-effects. However, the incomplete transfer between slant <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> {{makes it clear that}} higher-level adaptation is also involved, perhaps at the level of surface representation...|$|R
40|$|A {{face seal}} model is analyzed, {{taking into account}} both {{diametral}} <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> coning of the primary seal ring. The Reynolds equation for incompressible fluid is solved analytically using the narrow seal approximation. The solution covers {{a wide range of}} <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> coning angles, from complete alignment to touch-down. Seal performance like axial force, <b>tilting</b> moment, axial <b>and</b> angular stiffness, and leakage are analyzed. It is found that interaction between diametral <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> coning strongly affects seal performance...|$|R

50|$|Unlike most view cameras, {{the shift}} {{mechanism}} allows shifts along only one axis, <b>and</b> the <b>tilt</b> mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, {{the rotation of}} the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> shift functions cannot be independently rotated. The lens is supplied with these functions at 90° to each other (e.g., providing <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> lateral shift); they can be changed to work in the same directions (e.g., providing <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> rise/fall) by removing four screws, rotating the front of the lens 90°, and reinstalling the screws.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a similar}} manner, at the Soviet launch site near Volgograd, a silo used to launch test rockets would have its top {{opened and a}} second stage <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> would be driven in {{horizontally}} <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> {{on top of a}} first stage already in the silo, the nose cone and some of the second stage remaining visible above ground. Hence no surface pad is used; Russian silos are reusable. This method was only used for the Cosmos series of small satellite launching vehicles.|$|R
40|$|The <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> {{decentration}} of {{intraocular lens}} (IOL) result in defocussing, astigmatism, and wavefront aberration after operation. The {{objective is to}} give a method to estimate the <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> decentration of IOL more accurately. Based on AS-OCT images of twelve eyes from eight cases with subluxation lens after operation, we fitted spherical equation to the data obtained from {{the images of the}} anterior and posterior surfaces of the IOL. By the established relationship between IOL <b>tilt</b> (decentration) <b>and</b> the scanned angle, at which a piece of AS-OCT image was taken by the instrument, the IOL <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> decentration were calculated. IOL <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration of each subject were given. Moreover, the horizontal <b>and</b> vertical <b>tilt</b> was also obtained. Accordingly, the possible errors of IOL <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> decentration existed in the method employed by AS-OCT instrument. Based on 6 – 12 pieces of AS-OCT images at different directions, the <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration values were shown, respectively. The method of the surface fitting to the IOL surface can accurately analyze the IOL’s location, and six pieces of AS-OCT images at three pairs symmetrical directions are enough to get <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration value of IOL more precisely...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive optics {{systems can}} measure {{high-order}} aberrations using an artificial laser beacon {{without the need}} for a relatively bright object near the object being imaged. Unfortunately, <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus measurements are difficult to obtain from a laser beacon. One solution is to use light from the object being imaged to measure <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus. Through analysis, I estimate the performance of using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with 2 by 2 sub-apertures for measuring <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus. Specifically, I discuss implementing this scheme for the sodium beacon adaptive optics upgrade to the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) 3. 5 m telescope.

40|$|A model {{predictive}} control strategy is developed for an autonomous parafoil <b>and</b> <b>payload</b> system.

In order to use the reduced state linear model for model {{predictive control}} the desired trajectory in the x-y plane is mapped into a desired heading angle using Lagrange interpolating polynomials.
