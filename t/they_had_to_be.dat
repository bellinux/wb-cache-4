Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Person {{tracking}} {{is a key}} {{requirement for}} modern service robots. But methods for robot vision <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fulfill several constraints: <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> robust <b>to</b> errors evoked by noisy sensor data, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> work under realworld conditions, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fast and computationally inexpensive. In this paper we present an approach for tracking {{the position of a}} person in 3 D based on a particle filter. In our framework, each particle represents a hypothesis for the 3 D position, velocity and size of the person’s head being tracked. Two cameras are used for the evaluation of the particles. The particles are weighted by projecting them onto the camera image and applying a color-based perception model. This model uses skin color cues for face tracking and color histograms for body tracking. In contrast to feature-based approaches, our system even works when the person is temporary or partially occluded. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} the men of the AIF were selected under some of the toughest criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed that roughly 30 per cent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. In order to enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least five foot six inches tall (168 centimetres), with a chest measurement of at least 34inches (86 centimetres). Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew.

5|$|Russia possessed thirty-six cavalry {{divisions}} when {{it entered}} {{the war in}} 1914, and the Russian government claimed that its horsemen would thrust deep {{into the heart of}} Germany. Although Russian mounted troops entered Germany, they were soon met by German forces. In the August 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, troops led by German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Lieutenant-General Erich Ludendorff surrounded the Russian Second Army and destroyed the mounted force of Don Cossacks that served as the special guard of Russian General Alexander Samsonov. Other Russian cavalry units successfully harassed retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in September 1914, with the running battle eventually resulting in the loss of 40,000 of the 50,000men in the Austro-Hungarian XIV Tyrolean Corps, which included the 6th Mounted Rifle Regiment. Transporting cavalry created a hardship for the already strained Russian infrastructure, as the great distances they needed to be moved meant that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transported by train. Approximately the same number of trains (about 40) were required to transport a cavalry division of 4,000 as to transport an infantry division of 16,000.|$|E
