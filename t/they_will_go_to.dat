The only {{way to get out of}} jail before trial is to post a minimum $15,000 bond.|$|E
25|$|The cock {{performs}} {{with his}} wings, alternating wing beats, until he attracts a mate. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the mating area {{and he will}} maintain privacy by driving away all intruders. They graze until their behaviour is synchronized, then the feeding becomes secondary and the process takes on a ritualistic appearance. The cock will then excitedly flap alternate wings again, and start poking {{on the ground with}} his bill. He will then violently flap his wings to symbolically clear out a nest in the soil. Then, while the hen runs a circle around him with lowered wings, he will wind his head in a spiral motion. She will drop to the ground and he will mount for copulation. Common ostriches raised entirely by humans may direct their courtship behaviour not at other ostriches, but toward their human keepers.|$|E
500|$|King {{said that}} the album {{contained}} origins relating to [...] "war stories" [...] and [...] "explorations of madness".

500|$|... "Motorbreath" [...] {{was written}} by Hetfield during his time in Leather Charm and tells about life on the road. The song {{is based on a}} four-chord verse and a stop-and-start chorus. The most {{recognizable}} parts are Ulrich's drum rolls in each chorus and the riff that accompanies Hammett's solos. Because of its speed, the song requires fast picking by the bassist. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was originally written by Mustaine, with lyrics about teenage sexual experience. Hetfield's revised lyrics for the album were written from Satan's point of view, describing how the devil watches people killing each other, and is sure <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> hell for their actions. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was released as a single in the UK in February 1984 to promote a UK tour with Venom. The single featured [...] "Phantom Lord" [...] and [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] as live tracks, although they are actually studio recordings with fake crowd noise dubbed over them. The single's cover art features an oil painting titled The Devils of D-Day, created by artist Les Edwards in 1978.|$|E

They find Neha at a fashion show and try to apologise, but she refuses to see them. Unaware of [...] Neha and Abhi's break-up, they ask about the wedding and Neha tells them about Veer's fears. Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg on their knees, say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi and Neha are both amazed by the lengths to which <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> regain her trust; Neha forgives them. Kunal and Sam then get down on their knees and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees. Two months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say [...] "no", remembering their kiss.|$|E

2500|$|Dirk Frans, {{executive}} director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a [...] "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: [...] "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> advance their twisted ideology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to Coach Genghis. The Baudelaire orphans immediately recognize him as Count Olaf in disguise but pretend to be fooled.

"We should {{transform}} the Bedouin into an urban proletariat - in industry, services, construction, and agriculture. 88% of the Israeli population are not farmers, let the Bedouin be like them. Indeed, {{this will be}} a radical move which means that the Bedouin would not live on his land with his herds, but would become an urban person who comes home in the afternoon and puts his slippers on. His children will get used to a father who wears pants, without a dagger, and who does not pick out their nits in public. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school, their hair combed and parted. This will be a revolution, but it can be achieved in two generations. Without coercion but with governmental direction ... this phenomenon of the Bedouins will disappear." ...|$|E

2500|$|The hōkyōintō {{tradition}} in Japan {{is believed to}} have begun during the Asuka period (550–710 CE). They used to be made of wood and started to be made in stone only during the Kamakura period. It is also during this period that they started to be used as tombstones and cenotaphs. [...] The hōkyōintō started to be made in its present form during the Kamakura period. Like a gorintō, it is divided in five main sections representing the five elements of Japanese cosmology. The sūtra it sometimes hides contain all the pious deeds of a Tathagata Buddha, and the faithful believe that, by praying in front of the hōkyōintō, their sins will be canceled, during their lives they will be protected from disasters and after death <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> heaven.|$|E
2500|$|The {{critical}} reception {{was generally}} positive, with some mixed responses. Review aggregator iDreamBooks gives it (...) a 73% meta-score from 61 critic reviews (48 positive, 13 negative) and 868 user ratings (76% positive). Meta-reviewer Complete Review summarized 20 press reviews as, [...] "No real consensus; many find it winning, many irritated by {{too much about}} it/Murakami's writing" [...] (in addition to their own assessment, [...] "B+: typically Murakamian shallow depth, but goes down very nice and easy"). Kirkus Reviews included the novel in its list of best books of 2014, describing it as [...] "Another tour de force from Japan’s greatest living novelist." [...] In {{the review of the}} novel for The New York Times, Patti Smith wrote [...] "This is a book for both the new and experienced reader. It has a strange casualness, as if it unfolded as Murakami wrote it; at times, it seems like a prequel to a whole other narrative... A shedding of Murakami skin. It is not [...] "Blonde on Blonde," [...] it is [...] "Blood on the Tracks." [...] Reviewing the novel for NPR, Meg Wolitzer wrote: [...] "Colorless Tsukuru's mystery is solved before the end, but the mystery of the spell that the great Murakami casts over his readers, myself included, goes, as ever, unsolved. The novel feels like a riddle, a puzzle, or maybe, actually, more like a haiku: full of beauty, strangeness, and color, thousands of syllables long." [...] In the review of the novel for The Washington Post, Marie Arana called it [...] "a deeply affecting novel, not only for the dark nooks and crannies it explores, but for the magic that seeps into its characters’ subconsciouses, for the lengths to which <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> protect or damage one another, for the brilliant characterizations it delivers along the way... Murakami can herd the troubles of a very large world and still mind a few precious details. He may be taking us deeper and deeper into a fractured modernity and its uneasy inhabitants, but he is ever alert to minds and hearts, to what it is, precisely, that they feel and see, and to humanity’s abiding and indomitable spirit." ...|$|E
