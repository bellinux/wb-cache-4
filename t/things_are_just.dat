5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title.

The song finds Swift {{playing with the}} idea of colors in {{relation}} to her emotions about a relationship. Before playing the track, Swift explained its meaning: [...] "I wrote this song about the fact that some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> hard to forget," [...] she said, [...] "because the emotions involved with them were so intense and, to me, intense emotion is red." [...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. [...] "Thinking about what that means to me and all the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," [...] I noted. [...] "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings." ...|$|E

40|$|The medieval {{commentators}} of the Nicomachean Ethics paid {{special attention}} to the Aristotelian distinction between <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by nature and <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by law. This paper examines how three commentators from {{the first half of the}} 14 th century understood this text: Radulfus Brito, Walter Burley and Geraldus Odonis. The interpretations of the first two was notoriously influenced by that of Aquinas, in spite of the Condemnation of 1277, since they understood Natural Justice in terms of Aquinas’s theory of Natural Law. On his part, Odonis, who was the first Franciscan to write a commentary on the Ethics, is more original, as evidenced in (i) his idea that in all manifestations of Legal Justice there are always underlying natural elements; (ii) his concern to link Aristotle’s teaching on Natural Justice with certain Platonic themes; and by (iii) his rather convincing analyses of the examples that Aristotle offers when addressing the possibility of change in both <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by nature and <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by law...|$|R

I had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.

60|$|Our {{knowledge}} of the material world is obtained {{by means of the}} senses, of sight and touch and so on. At first it is supposed that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as they seem, but two opposite sophistications soon destroy this naïve belief. On the one hand the physicists cut up matter into molecules, atoms, corpuscles, and as many more such subdivisions as their future needs may make them postulate, and the units at which they arrive are uncommonly different from the visible, tangible objects of daily life. A unit of matter tends more and more to be something like an electromagnetic field filling all space, though having its greatest intensity in a small region. Matter consisting of such elements is as remote from daily life as any metaphysical theory. It differs from the theories of metaphysicians only in the fact that its practical efficacy proves that it contains some measure of truth and induces business men to invest money on the strength of it; but, in spite of its connection with the money market, it remains a metaphysical theory none the less.|$|E
