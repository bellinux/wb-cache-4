5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E

5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} {{concerned}} that Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> though, mid-1794, Spain was attempting to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, was attempting to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became concerned that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E

One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that he was fine with Cristina dating other men.|$|E
5|$|Ho Yuen Hoe {{was born}} on 18 February 1908, to a family of silk weavers in Guangzhou, China, the second of three children. Her family was poor, and she was sold when she was five years old. Barely two years later, the {{spinster}} who had purchased her died, and Ho was sold by the woman's nephew, to become a maid. After a few years she was sold again. In her late teens, a group of snakeheads persuaded her and several other girls to emigrate to Singapore, ostensibly {{to work on a}} rubber plantation, but the job did not materialise. At the age of 21, alone and penniless, she married the owner of a grocery business. When the business failed, they left for Hong Kong, hoping for better fortune. Ho became a hairdresser in nearby Macau, but after discovering that her husband had another wife and children she decided to return to Singapore alone, vowing never to remarry.

5|$|The {{idea for}} a Linguistic Institute was first {{proposed}} {{in the spring of}} 1927 by Reinhold Saleski. The fledgling Society was hesitant at first, but Edgar Sturtevant was keen on the idea. Sturtevant molded Saleski's idea into a model still used today: a gathering of scholars in conjunction with coursework. The Executive Committee voted to authorize the first Linguistic Institute, to be held 1928, along with authorization for a second institute in 1929. After the fourth Institute in 1931, the program took a four-year hiatus due to the great depression. Institutes were held every year concurrently with summer meetings of the LSA until 1988 when, due to increasing costs, the Society announced that the Linguistic Institutes would be held every other year. It was at <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> that the summer meeting of the LSA was also discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The two {{tubes of}} the 53rd Street Tunnel under the East River began {{construction}} in spring 1927, and were fully excavated between Queens and Manhattan in January 1929, with a ventilation shaft built on Welfare Island (today's Roosevelt Island). On October 4, 1928, the Board of Estimate approved {{the construction of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. During the line's construction, several intersections of Queens Boulevard with major roads were grade separated, in a similar manner to Grand Concourse in the Bronx during the building of the IND Concourse Line around <b>that</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> At adjacent intersections with Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Boulevard (now the Long Island Expressway) in Elmhurst, Queens Boulevard's main road was depressed into underpasses. In Kew Gardens, Union Turnpike and the Interboro Parkway (now the Jackie Robinson Parkway) were depressed below Queens Boulevard {{at the level of the}} Union Turnpike station's mezzanine.
