40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> is a {{critical}} phenomenon associated with the cyclic operation of dual-medium thermocline tanks in solar energy applications. Although <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> poses a serious impediment to thermocline operation, this failure mode in dual-medium thermocline tanks is not yet well understood. To study {{the potential for the}} occurrence of ratcheting, a comprehensive model of a thermocline tank that includes both the heterogeneous filler region as well as the composite tank wall is formulated. The filler region consists of a rock bed with interstitial molten salt, while the tank wall is composed of a steel shell with two layers of insulation (firebrick and ceramic). The model accounts separately for the rock and molten-salt regions in view of their different thermal properties. Various heat loss conditions are applied at the external tank surface to evaluate the effect of energy losses to the surroundings. Hoop stresses, which are governed by the magnitude of temperature fluctuations, are determined through both a detailed finite-element analysis and simple strain relations. The two methods are found to yield almost identical results. Temperature fluctuations are damped by heat losses to the surroundings, leading to a reduction in hoop stresses with increased heat losses. Failure is prevented when the peak hoop stress is less than the material yield strength of the steel shell. To avoid ratcheting without incurring excessive energy loss, insulation between the steel shell and the filler region should be maximized.

40|$|The use {{of solar}} thermal power systems coupled with thermal energy storage (TES) is being studied for both {{terrestrial}} and space applications.

However, the use of PCM has also certain disadvantages which must be addressed.

40|$|Molten-salt {{thermocline}} {{tanks are}} a low-cost option for {{thermal energy storage}} in concentrating solar power systems. A review of previous experimental and numerical thermocline tank studies is performed to identify key issues associated with tank design and performance. Published models have shown that tank discharge performance improves with both larger tank height and smaller internal filler diameter due to increased thermal stratification and sustained outflow of molten salt with high thermal quality. For well-insulated (adiabatic) tanks, low molten-salt flow rates reduce the axial extent of the heat-exchange region and increase discharge efficiency. Under nonadiabatic conditions, low flow rates become detrimental to stratification due {{to the development of}} fluid recirculation zones inside the tank. For such tanks, higher flow rates reduce molten-salt residence time inside the tank and improve discharge efficiency. Despite the economic advantages of a thermocline tank, <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> of the tank wall remains a significant design concern. The potential for <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> is reduced through the inclusion of an internal thermal insulation layer between the molten salt and tank wall to diminish temperature oscillations along the tank wall.

40|$|The {{past couple}} of decades have shown a concern when {{considering}} {{the way the world}} obtains its power. The focus has been switching from fossil fuels that have been used for hundreds of years to renewable energy sources, such as the sun. Solar energy is readily and infinitely available for harnessing. One problem with solar energy, though, is its inability to be used during the night time and during cloud covered weather. A solution to this problem is the use of energy storage mechanisms. For solar plants that use solar thermal energy (concentrating solar power plants), thermal energy storage (TES) has been the focus. Single tank thermocline TES systems have been used on a limited basis with packed beds as the filler material to lower costs compared to traditional two tank storage options. In this type of system, a thermal gradient is maintained inside of the tank {{in order to keep the}} hot and the cold fluid within the same tank without thermal mixing. The problem with packed beds is that settling of the filler material during thermal cycling causes <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> on the tank from increased wall hoop stresses. This could ultimately cause a catastrophic failure of the tank wall. This research focuses on concrete being used in a thermocline type TES system with nitrate solar salt as the heat transfer fluid.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} based upon the Linear Matching Method {{in order to obtain}} the ratchet limit of structures subjected to an arbitrary thermo-mechanical load history. This method varies from the traditional Linear Matching Method ratchet analysis, where the cyclic load history is decomposed into cyclic and constant components, instead calculating the ratchet limit with respect to a proportional cyclic load variation, as opposed to an additional constant load. The shakedown and limit load boundaries are initially obtained for the given structure, followed by the utilisation of a bisection procedure in order to calculate an approximate ratchet boundary based upon a predefined magnitude of ratchet strain per cycle. The method also yields the total and plastic strain ranges based upon perfect plasticity, for low-cycle fatigue post-processing considerations. The effects of analysing the ratcheting mechanism of structures undergoing a cyclic primary load that varies proportionally with a cyclic secondary load can be seen to lead to modified and less conservative ratchet boundaries compared to the traditional Bree solution in which the <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> requirement (NB- 3222. 5) of ASME III is based upon.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in large-scale solar power production {{has led to a}} renewed exploration of thermal storage technologies. In a thermocline storage system, heat transfer fluid (HTF) from the collection field is simultaneously stored at both excited and dead thermal states inside a single tank by exploiting buoyancy forces. A granulated porous medium included in the tank provides additional thermal mass for storage and reduces the volume of HTF required.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is presented that bacteriophage DNA packaging motors have a cycle comprised of bind/release <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> with release-associated DNA pushing via ATP-dependent protein folding. The proposed protein folding occurs in crystallographically observed peptide segments that project into an axial channel of a protein 12 -mer (connector) that serves, {{together with a}} coaxial ATPase multimer, as the entry portal. The proposed cycle begins when reverse thermal motion causes the connector’s peptide segments to signal the ATPase multimer to bind both ATP and the DNA molecule, thereby producing a dwell phase recently demonstrated by single-molecule procedures. The connector-associated peptide segments activate by transfer of energy from ATP during the dwell. The proposed function of connector/ATPase symmetry mismatches is to reduce thermal noise-induced signaling errors. After a dwell, ATP is cleaved and the DNA molecule released. The activated peptide segments push the released DNA molecule, thereby producing a burst phase recently shown to consist of four mini-bursts. The constraint of four mini-bursts is met by proposing that each mini-burst occurs via pushing by three of the 12 subunits of the connector. If all four mini-bursts occur, the cycle repeats. If the mini-bursts are not completed, a second cycle is superimposed on the first cycle. The existence of the second cycle is based on data recently obtained with bacteriophage T 3.

Several estimations lead to a potential cost reduction of 35 % compared to a two tank configuration while retaining a good efficiency. Thermocline tanks, in packed bed configurations, are mostly designed using filler materials to reduce the required amount of the expensive molten salt. The main problem of this technology is the <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> {{which can lead to}} dramatic structural failure of the tank. One solution could be to use a structured bed configuration.

40|$|A molten-salt {{thermocline}} tank is {{a low-cost}} option for {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. Typical dual-media thermocline (DMT) tanks contain molten salt and a filler material that provides sensible heat capacity at reduced cost. However, conventional quartzite rock filler introduces the potential for thermomechanical failure by successive <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> of the tank wall under cyclical operation. To avoid this potential mode of failure, the tank may be operated as a singlemedium thermocline (SMT) tank containing solely molten salt. However, {{in the absence of}} filler material to dampen tank-scale convection eddies, internal mixing can reduce the quality of the stored thermal energy. To assess the relative merits of these two approaches, the operation of DMT and SMT tanks is simulated under different periodic charge/discharge cycles and tank wall boundary conditions to compare the performance with and without a filler material. For all conditions assessed, both thermocline tank designs have excellent thermal storage performance, although marginally higher firstand second-law efficiencies are predicted for the SMT tank. While heat loss through the tank wall to the ambient induces internal flow nonuniformities in the SMT design over the scale of the entire tank, strong stratification maintains separation of the hot and cold regions by a narrow thermocline; thermocline growth is limited by the low thermal diffusivity of the molten salt. Heat transport and flow phenomena inside the DMT tank, on the other hand, are governed to a great extent by thermal diffusion, which causes elongation of the thermocline. Both tanks are highly resistant to performance loss over periods of static operation, and the deleterious effects of dwell time are limited in both tank designs...|$|E
40|$|Increasing global energy {{demands and}} {{diminishing}} {{fossil fuel resources}} have raised increased interest in harvesting renewable energy resources. Solar energy is a promising candidate, as sufficient irradiance is incident to the Earth to supply the energy demands of all of its inhabitants. At the utility scale, concentrating solar power (CSP) plants provide the most cost-efficient method of harnessing solar energy for conversion to electrical energy. A major roadblock to the large-scale implementation of CSP plants {{is the lack of}} thermal energy storage (TES) that would allow the continued production of electricity during the absence of constant irradiance. Sensible heat TES has been suggested as the most viable form of TES for CSP plants. Two-tank fluid TES systems have been incorporated at several CSP plants, significantly enhancing the performance of the plants. A single-tank thermocline TES system, requiring a reduced liquid media volume, has been suggested as a cost-reducing alternative. Unfortunately, the packed-aggregate bed of such TES system introduces the issue of <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> and rupture of the tank 2 ̆ 7 s walls. To address this issue, {{it has been suggested that}} structured concrete be used in place of the aggregate bed. Potential concrete mix designs have been developed and tested for this application.

40|$|Concentrating {{solar power}} (CSP) is a {{renewable}} and demonstrated technology for large-scale power generation but requires multiple engineering advancements to achieve grid parity with conventional fossil fuels. Part of this advancement includes novel and inexpensive thermal energy systems to decouple daily power production from intermittent solar collection. Dual-media thermocline tanks, composed of molten salt and solid rock filler, offer low-cost storage capability {{but the concept}} has experienced limited deployment in CSP plants due to unresolved concerns about long-term thermal and structural stability. The main objective of the present work is to advance the understanding of thermocline storage design and operation necessary for future commercial implementations. A multiscale numerical approach is conducted to investigate tank behavior at both a device level for comprehensive short-term analysis and at a system-level for reduced-order long-term analysis. ^ A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is first developed to simulate molten-salt thermocline tanks in response to cyclic charge and discharge modes of operation. The model builds upon previous work in the literature with an expanded study of the internal solid filler size as well as added consideration for practical limits on tank height. Reducing the internal filler size improves thermal stratification inside the tank but decreases the bed permeability, resulting in a design tradeoff between storage performance and required pumping power. An effective rock diameter of 1 cm {{is found to be}} the most practical selection among the sizes considered. Also of interest is the structural stability of the thermocline tank wall in response to large temperature fluctuations associated with repeated charging and discharging. If sufficient hoop stress is generated from storage cycles, the tank becomes susceptible to failure via <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting.</b> The thermocline tank model is therefore extended to predict wall stress associated with operation and determine if ratcheting is expected to occur. Analysis is first performed with a multilayer structure to identify stable tank wall designs. Inclusion of internal thermal insulation between the porous bed and the steel wall is found to best prevent <b>thermal</b> <b>ratcheting</b> by decoupling the thermal response of the wall from the interior salt behavior. The structural modeling approach is then validated with a simulation of the 182 MWht thermocline tank installed at the historic Solar One power tower plant. The hoop stress predictions are found to show reasonable agreement with reported strain gage data along the tank wall and verify that the tank was not susceptible to ratcheting. ^ The preceding use of commercial CFD software for thermocline tank simulation provides comprehensive solutions but the ease of application of this approach with respect to different operating scenarios is constrained by high computing costs. A new reduced-order model of energy transport inside a thermocline tank is therefore developed to provide thermal solutions at much lower computational cost. The storage model is first validated with past experimental data and then integrated into a system model of a 100 MWe molten-salt power tower plant, such that the thermocline tank is subjected to realistic solar collection and power production processes. Results from the system-level approach verify that a thermocline tank remains an effective and viable energy storage system over long-term operation within a CSP plant. The system-level analysis is then extended with an economic assessment of thermocline storage in a power tower plant. A parametric study of the plant solar multiple and thermocline tank size highlights suitable plant designs to minimize the levelized cost of electricity. Among the cases considered, a minimum levelized cost of 12. 2 ¢/kWhe is achieved, indicating that cost reductions outside of thermal energy storage remain necessary to obtain grid parity. ^ As a sensible heat storage method, dual-media thermocline tanks remains subject to low energy densities and require large tank volumes. A possible design modification to reduce tank size is a substitution of the internal rock filler with an encapsulated phase-change material (PCM), which adds a high density latent heat storage mechanism to the tank assembly. The reduced-order thermocline tank model is first updated to include capsules of a hypothetical PCM and then reintegrated into the power tower plant system model. Implementation of a single PCM inside the tank does not yield significant energy storage gains because of an inherent tradeoff between the thermodynamic quality (i. e., melting temperature and heat of fusion) of the added latent heat and its utilization in storage operations. This problem may be circumvented with a cascaded filler structure composed of multiple PCMs with their melting temperatures tuned along the tank height. However, the benefit of a cascade structure is highly sensitive to appropriate selection of the PCM melting points relative to the thermocline tank operating temperatures. ...|$|E

Based on the loading method in second case, a smooth thin hollow cylinder is considered to simulate the progressive deformation. This condition simulates the 1 / 25 th scale down model of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) main vessel...|$|R
40|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>ratchets</b> model toggles a {{spatially}} periodic asymmetric {{potential to}} rectify random walks and achieve transport of diffusing particles. We numerically solve the governing equation {{for the full}} dynamics of an infinite 1 D ratchet model in response to periodic switching. Transient aperiodic behavior is observed that converges asymptotically to {{the period of the}} switching. We study measures of the transport rate, the transient lifetime, and an equivalent of `amplitude', then investigate their dependence on various properties of the system, along with other features of the transient and asymptotic dynamics.

40|$|The overdamped <b>thermal</b> <b>ratchet</b> {{driven by}} an {{external}} (Orstein-Uhlenbeck) noise is revisited. The ratchet we consider is unbounded in space and not necessarily periodic. We briefly discuss {{the conditions under which}} current is obtained by analyzing the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and its lack of stationary states. Next, two examples in more than one dimension and related to biological systems are presented. First, a two-dimensional model of a ``kinesin protein'' on a ``microtubule'' is analyzed and, second, we suggest that a ratchet mechanism may be behind the folding of proteins; the latter is elaborated with a multidimensional ratchet model.
