5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed <b>to</b> <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not <b>to</b> <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> European and Third World refugees helped {{prepare the}} UNHCR {{for a change}} in the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability <b>to</b> <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order <b>to</b> <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> different objects.

This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black. This is very important because it gives an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater that might give them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Dyskinesia Impairment Scale (DIS) {{is a new}} {{scale for}} {{measuring}} dystonia and choreoathetosis in dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy (CP). Previously, reliability of this scale has only been assessed for raters highly experienced in <b>discriminating</b> <b>between</b> dystonia and choreoathetosis. Aims: The aims {{of this study are}} to examine the reliability of the DIS used by inexperienced raters, new <b>to</b> <b>discriminating</b> <b>between</b> dystonia and choreoathetosis and to determine the effect of clinical expertise on reliability. Methods: Twenty-five patients (17 males; 8 females; age range 5 - 22 years; mean age = 13 years 6 months; SD = 5 years 4 months) with dyskinetic CP were filmed with the DIS standard video protocol. Two junior physiotherapists (PTs) and three senior PTs, all of whom were new <b>to</b> <b>discriminating</b> <b>between</b> dystonia and choreoathetosis, were trained in scoring the DIS. Afterward, they independently scored all patients from the video recordings using the DIS. Reliability was assessed by (1) Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), (2) Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) and Minimal Detectable Difference (MDD) and (3) Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. Results: Interrater reliability for the total DIS, and for the dystonia and choreoathetosis subscales was good for the junior PTs and moderately high to excellent for the senior PTs. SEM and MDD values for the total DIS were 6 % and 15 % respectively for the junior PTs and 4 % and 12 % respectively for the senior PTs. Cronbach's alpha ranged between 0. 87 and 0. 95 for the junior PTs and between 0. 76 and 0. 93 for the senior PTs. Conclusions: Reliability of the DIS scores for the inexperienced junior and senior PTs was sufficient in comparison with scores from the experienced raters in the previous study, indicating that the DIS can be used by inexperienced PTs new <b>to</b> <b>discriminating</b> <b>between</b> dystonia and choreoathetosis, and also that its reliability is not dependent on clinical expertise. However, based on the measurement errors and questionnaire data, familiarity with operational definitions of dystonia and choreoathetosis is crucial to improve scoring reliability. © 2012 European Paediatric Neurology Society.
