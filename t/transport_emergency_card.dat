40|$|An <b>emergency</b> {{occurring}} while <b>transporting</b> {{a hazardous}} substance {{may have a}} rather high-risk potential, depending {{on the amount of}} transported product, on its hazardous characteristics and on the features of the surrounding environment. This paper addresses road and rail transport of hazardous materials, with the objective of outlining some guidelines and providing a tool for the management of <b>transport</b> <b>emergencies.</b> An effective management of a transportation emergency derives from a careful balance of the opposite needs for the immediate availability of the information and its reliability. The procedure here proposed suggests to divide the data of concern into product-related information and environment-related information, estimating in advance the impact zones for some reference scenarios. By including all product related information into a database and all territorial information in a GIS (Geographic Information System) application, and combining the two, a fast and powerful tool for <b>transport</b> <b>emergency</b> management is obtained...|$|R

40|$|We studied {{exposures}} to higher daily maximum temperatures and concentrations of air pollutants in Tokyo {{during the summer}} months of July and August from 1980 to 1995 and their effects on hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>transports</b> for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases for males and females > 65 years of age.

Except for pneumonia, daily maximum temperatures were not associated with hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>transports.</b> Increasing daily maximum temperatures, however, were associated with decreased hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>transports</b> for hypertension. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide or particulate matter < or = 10 microm, however, were associated with daily hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>transports</b> for angina, cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction, asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia. For cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, myocardial infarction, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia, the expected daily number of <b>emergency</b> <b>transports</b> per million were greater for males than for females. For angina and acute bronchitis, there were no differences for the expected daily numbers of <b>emergency</b> <b>transports</b> per million between males and females...|$|R
