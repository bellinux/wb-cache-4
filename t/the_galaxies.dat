5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort the shape of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies,</b> forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E

Samsung first announced <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> S6 and Galaxy S6 edge on 1 March 2015. On 13 August 2015, Samsung announced <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> S6 edge+, {{along with}} <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> Note5. <b>The</b> <b>Galaxy</b> S6 series improves upon its predecessors {{by adding the}} ability to quickly and wirelessly charge the phone, virtual reality (compatible with <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> Gear VR), a [...] "Smart Manager" [...] feature, {{and the ability to}} customize the interface with themes. It also features a new metal and glass build.|$|R
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Most {{galaxies in}} the Universe are gravitationally bound {{to a number of}} other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is {{the most common type of}} galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in the Universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>galaxy</b> {{is one of}} <b>the</b> {{brightest}} two <b>galaxies</b> in <b>the</b> IC 342/Maffei Group of <b>galaxies,</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> {{groups that}} is closest to the Local Group. <b>The</b> <b>galaxy</b> was discovered by William Frederick Denning in 1895. Edwin Hubble first thought it {{to be in the}} Local Group, but later it was demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> is outside <b>the</b> Local Group.|$|R
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|She {{enrolled}} at Cornell University, {{and earned a}} master's degree in 1951. During her graduate studies, she studied the motions of 109 galaxies and made {{one of the first}} observations of deviations from Hubble flow (how <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> move apart from one another). She worked with astronomer Martha Carpenter on galactic dynamics, and studied under Philip Morrison, Hans Bethe, and Richard Feynman. Though the conclusion she came to - that there was an orbital motion of galaxies around a particular pole - was disproven, the idea that galaxies were moving held true and sparked further research. Her research also provided early evidence of the supergalactic plane. This information and the data she discovered was immensely controversial, and after fighting to be allowed to present her work at the American Astronomical Society despite being pregnant, she was summarily rejected and the paper forgotten.|$|E
50|$|Until 2014, {{not much}} {{was known about}} <b>the</b> <b>galaxy,</b> other than <b>the</b> fact it was irregular. In early 2014, <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> was {{observed}} with a 2-foot telescope at the SARA remote observatory in Chile, revealing <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> in higher resolution. It appears <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> is in <b>the</b> process of forming stars at a high rate - primarily in the red areas in the image. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> has several small clumps of stars, implying an ongoing merger.|$|R
50|$|If {{the kick}} {{velocity}} {{is less than}} the escape velocity from <b>the</b> <b>galaxy,</b> <b>the</b> SMBH will fall back toward <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> nucleus, oscillating many times through <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> before finally coming to rest. In this case, the HCSS would only exist as a distinct object for a relatively short time, of order hundreds of millions of years, before disappearing back into <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> nucleus. During this time the HCSS would be difficult to detect since it would be superposed on or behind <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The NGC 1569 is a dwarf {{irregular}} <b>galaxy</b> in Camelopardalis. <b>The</b> <b>galaxy</b> {{is relatively}} nearby. Consequently, the Hubble Space Telescope can easily resolve the stars within <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b> <b>The</b> distance to <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> was previously {{believed to be}} only 2.4 Mpc (7.8 Mly). [...] However, in 2008 scientists studying images from Hubble calculated <b>the</b> <b>galaxy's</b> distance at nearly 11 million light-years away, about 4 million light-years farther than previous thought: therefore <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> resulted {{to be a member}} of the IC 342 group of galaxies.|$|R
5|$|The Coma Supercluster, itself {{part of the}} Coma Filament, {{contains}} the Coma and Leo Cluster of galaxies. The Coma Cluster (Abell 1656) is 230 to 300 million light-years away. It {{is one of the}} largest known clusters, with at least 10,000 galaxies (mainly elliptical, with a few spiral galaxies). Due to its distance from Earth, most of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> are visible only through large telescopes. Its brightest members are NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, both with a magnitude of 13; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer. NGC 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest known black holes (21 billion solar masses), and NGC 4921 is the cluster's brightest spiral galaxy. After observing the Coma Cluster, astronomer Fritz Zwicky first postulated the existence of dark matter during the 1930s. The massive galaxy Dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely of dark matter. Its mass is very similar to that of the Milky Way, but it emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would {{be found at the}} centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Samsung <b>Galaxy</b> W (i8150), {{also known}} as Wonder, is an Android {{smartphone}} that is a smaller-sized variant of <b>the</b> Samsung <b>Galaxy</b> S II. <b>The</b> <b>Galaxy</b> W is a less-powerful downgrade compared to <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> S II, with a specification comparable to <b>the</b> larger <b>Galaxy</b> R and a 9.34 cm (3.7 in) WVGA TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 480x800. The phone also features a 5-megapixel still-image camera {{that is capable of}} 720p video capture. The main differences between <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> W and other variants are its processor (1.4 GHz single core manufactured by Qualcomm), its higher pixel density compared to <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> S II and <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy</b> R, and a slightly different physical design.|$|R

5|$|The {{strength}} of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the damping factor, which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The {{strength of}} the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The primary effects on the diffusion length are from {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process. The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the Silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the Silk mass and it corresponds to the mass of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{collecting}} enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory regains {{the power}} to transform into a comet, and flies to {{the centre of the}} universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that his plan is to rule the entire universe with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach, but Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming everything nearby. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The black hole collapses into a singularity and explodes in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, revealing that dying stars are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, full with all of the creatures he had met in <b>the</b> <b>galaxies,</b> alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is stable once formed and will {{continue}} to cool almost indefinitely, eventually to become a black dwarf. Assuming that the Universe continues to expand, it is thought that in 1019 to 1020 years, <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space.,Â§IIIA. White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion, although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova.,Â§IIIC,IV. The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought to be on the order of the lifetime of the proton, known to be at least 1034â€“1035 years. Some grand unified theories predict a proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years. If these theories are not valid, the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole; in these cases, the lifetime is estimated to be no more than 10200 years. If protons do decay, the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay, until it loses enough mass to become a nondegenerate lump of matter, and finally disappears completely.,Â§IV.|$|E
5|$|Hoag's Object, located 600 {{million light-years}} from Earth, {{is a member}} of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. The outer ring is largely {{composed}} of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's coherence and therefore detached. Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> NGC 5953 and NGC 5954. In this case, both are active galaxies, with the former a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction.|$|E
5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxiesâ€”NGC 4038 and 4039â€”that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. <b>The</b> <b>galaxies</b> are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolfâ€“Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system.
