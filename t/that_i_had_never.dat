I answered in the negative, telling him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E

Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role [...] "everything that I intended, and much <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> dreamed of". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois [...] "tipped me over into madness".|$|E

Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: [...] "How dare you!", and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had [...] "no sense of humour", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: [...] "I now realize <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years." [...] Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.|$|E

500|$|A jazz fusion album, Song of Innocence {{combines}} jazz elements with impressionistic musical {{figures and}} hard rock guitar solos. Its music also incorporates funk, rock, theatre, and pop styles. Music journalists categorized the record as jazz-rock, baroque pop, and psychedelic R. John Murph of JazzTimes magazine said the music {{could be better}} characterized as art pop than jazz. Axelrod, who had produced bebop albums before working for Capitol, asserted that jazz {{played a crucial role}} in the music: [...] "For years, all I did was jazz. When I first got in the record business, I was so into jazz <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard Elvis Presley. I still probably listen to jazz more than anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Best {{decided to}} leave show business, {{and by the time}} of Hunter Davies' {{authorised}} Beatles' biography in 1968, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles association. Years later he stated in his autobiography, [...] "the Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> really been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them". This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that [...] "Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill. With his periodic illness." [...] Starr added: [...] "He took little pills to make him ill." [...] Best sued the Beatles for defamation of character, eventually winning an out-of-court settlement for much less than the $18 million he had sought.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Bannon's {{books were}} {{featured}} in the documentary Before Stonewall about how {{gay men and lesbians}} lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: [...] "I picked up this paperback and I opened it up... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> felt before." [...] She was {{featured in the}} Canadian documentary [...] in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{included}} in Pitchforks list of their staff's favorite music books. Contributing writer Matthew Perpetua said the book's writers—either top critics at the time or those who have since become important figures in music journalism—outline the [...] "alternative sensibility" [...] by recognizing and connecting music from disparate genres in [...] "an inclusive, open-minded survey, but it's defined as much by what's left out—pretty much all Boomer-oriented rock—as what it includes." [...] According to Perpetua, the [...] "number of young readers [...] pursued music criticism" [...] because of the book was far greater than the copies it sold. Matthew Schnipper, editor of The Fader, bought the book after it was published and said he {{used it as a}} consumer guide for 10 years. Along with its influence on future critics, the book was cited by guitarist William Tyler as his only source of music education growing up, having found it in a bookstore around the time it was published: [...] "They had entries for all these different people <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of: Can, John Zorn, [...] Fahey, whatever...

2500|$|The album would {{ultimately}} consist of 15 full-length songs and four short [...] "interludes". As Amos was finding [...] "parts {{and pieces of}} myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> claimed" [...] on this journey, the 14 primary songs represent the number of body parts of the Egyptian god Osiris that his wife, the goddess Isis, had to find to put his body back together in Egyptian mythology. The arrangement of the songs on the album reflects the progression Amos intended to achieve on the double vinyl LP of the album; {{each of the four}} sides of the album on vinyl would open with an interlude track that leads into the rest of the three or four songs on each side. The vinyl release is the only version of the album in which the interludes ("Beauty Queen," [...] "Mr. Zebra," [...] "Way Down," [...] and [...] "Agent Orange") are not numbered.|$|E
2500|$|By early 1838, Smith and Cowdery {{disagreed}} {{on three}} significant issues. First, Cowdery competed with Smith for {{leadership of the}} new church and [...] "disagreed with the Prophet's economic and political program and sought a personal financial independence [...] Zion society that Joseph Smith envisioned." [...] Then too, in March 1838, Smith and Rigdon moved to Far West, which had been under the presidency of W. W. Phelps and Cowdery's brothers-in-law, David and John Whitmer. There Smith and Rigdon {{took charge of the}} Missouri church and initiated policies that Cowdery, Phelps, and the Whitmers believed violated {{the separation of church and}} state. Finally, in January 1838, Cowdery wrote his brother Warren that he and Smith [...] "had some conversation in which in every instance I did not fail to affirm that which I had said was strictly true. A dirty, nasty, filthy affair of his and Fanny Alger's was talked over in which I strictly declared <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> deserted from the truth in the matter, and as I supposed was admitted by himself." [...] Alger, a teenage maid living with the Smiths, may have been Smith's first plural wife, a practice that Cowdery opposed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, General Hospital {{was close}} to {{cancellation}} owing to low viewership. At that time, they were ranked lowest in the Nielsen ratings. To save the show, ABC executive Jackie Smith hired Gloria Monty as the show's executive producer and Douglas Marland as head writer. Monty wanted to attract a youth-based audience {{as a way of}} garnering higher ratings. To do this, she and Marland brought troubled teenager Laura Vining (Genie Francis) to the forefront of the series. The character went from appearing {{a couple of times a}} week to having fifty pages of script a day. [...] "Gloria put sex and romance into Laura's life," [...] Francis said, [...] "and it bowled me over. Here I was doing things in front of 20 million people <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> done in my life." [...] Her early stories included killing her older lover, David Hamilton, for cheating on her with her mother and a popular romance with Scott [...] "Scotty" [...] Baldwin. In response, General Hospital's ratings rose as younger viewers began watching for Laura. Teenagers connected with her because she was their age and experienced some of the same problems they did, yet also lived [...] "the life of a 28 year old".|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great [...] and he came and played live, {{so it was just}} like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen in anybody before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Korine {{was born}} in Bolinas, California and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, to a Jewish family. He {{is the son of}} Eve and Sol Korine. His father was a tapdancer and {{produced}} documentaries for PBS in the 1970s about an [...] "array of colorful Southern characters"; he would take Korine to carnivals and circuses and taught him how to use a Bolex camera. As a child, Korine watched movies with his father, who rented Buster Keaton films and took him to see Even Dwarfs Started Small in the theater. Korine reminisces, [...] "I knew there was a poetry in cinema <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen before that was so powerful." [...] As a child, Korine changed his name from [...] "Harmony" [...] and went by [...] "Harmful," [...] as he thought it made him sound tougher when he got in fights. Korine spent his childhood in Nashville, attending Hillsboro High School before moving to New York City to live with his grandmother. Korine also spent some time living with his parents in a commune, which helped to inspire the commune setting of Mister Lonely. As a teenager, Korine frequented revival theaters, watching classic films by John Cassavetes, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Alan Clarke. In an interview with Bruce LaBruce, Korine briefly mentioned that he studied Business Administration in college. Other sources state that he studied Dramatic Writing at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University for one semester before dropping out to pursue a career as a professional skateboarder.|$|E
2500|$|Several notable {{artists and}} musicians cite Milo Goes to College as a {{favorite}} and influence, including Mike Watt of the Minutemen, David Nolte of The Last, and Zach Blair of Hagfish, Only Crime, and Rise Against.

[...] Joey Cape of Lagwagon remarked that the album [...] "was just huge in punk and to me. I don’t think {{there would have been}} a [...] song like 'Angry Days' without that album." [...] Fat Mike of NOFX has cited Milo Goes to College as his favorite record of all time, and said that hearing the song [...] "Kabuki Girl" [...] on Rodney Bingenheimer's Rodney on the ROQ program on KROQ-FM was a significant moment in his youth. Chris Shary, who has done artwork for the Descendents and their successor band, All, since 1998, remarked that [...] "From the minute that I heard the beginning it was like 'this is the music that I have been waiting for. Photographer Glen E. Friedman, who photographed the band during the early 1980s, recalled that [...] "the album had just come out, and coincidentally I had my own little heartbreak as a teenager, and I heard that song 'Hope' and I gotta say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> in my life related to a song about love ever before until I heard that song [...] I was just 'Wow, this is fucking heavy.

[...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> had a ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly {{that you had to}} furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games.

2500|$|High Def Digest gave {{a rating}} of 4 stars, writing [...] "The Simpsons' {{is one of only}} a handful of shows that I know I'm {{guaranteed}} to laugh out loud at least once an episode (usually more). Even though the cutting wit of the first decade lost its edge a bit, I still find 'The Simpsons' an extremely enjoyable way to spend my time. There aren't many things that are better than sitting down with a new season of 'The Simpsons' on Blu-ray and watching every episode back to back as fast as I possibly can. While the episodes sort of blend together, the humor is still there, and I still end up having quite a few genuine laughs". CraveOnline rated the season 8.5/10, noting [...] "Some [...] "Simpsons" [...] fans gave up during a perceived rough patch around season 12, and boy have they missed out. Season 13 was a particular favorite of mine, but now we're over the hump on the DVD releases. Season 15 is kind of a sweet spot, because it's got some highlight episodes I love, but also plenty that I don't remember."

Imagine, then, my joy at being able to enjoy almost 22 episodes of factory-fresh Simpsons, even though they were made about a decade ago. And even though some of the cultural references are a little dated, there's still an awful lot to laugh at and enjoy here. As always, this season of The Simpsons features a stellar line-up of guest stars. And, as always, there are some standout episodes. All in all, a more than decent season of this long, long-running show." [...] DIY wrote [...] "While Season 15 of The Simpsons may not be golden from start to finish it has a higher great to soggy episode ratio than more recent seasons. In fact, there are some real gems amongst the 22 episodes". Boxofficebuz gave it 4 stars, and said [...] "...Throw in flashback episode 'The Way We ,' Pie-Man antics in 'Simple Simpson' and a Catch Me If You Can spoof in 'Catch 'Em If You Can,' you have a solid, solid season. A definite uptick over the previous couple seasons". BubbleBlabber rated it 9.0 out of 10, and concluded [...] "In terms of the content, Season 15 was a highly underrated season for The Simpsons and brought along a number of now well-known classics". DVDMg gave the season a B, and wrote [...] "Should viewers expect greatness from Season 15 of The Simpsons? No, as the year comes with some mediocre shows. Still, it delivers a reasonable number of good episodes and seems worthwhile overall...S15 won't win over new fans, but it's usually fun".|$|E
