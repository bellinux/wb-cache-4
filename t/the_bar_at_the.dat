5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{was called}} to <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He {{frequently}} visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality {{proved to be a}} hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to resent the editors.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar es Salaam {{and destroyed}} the German wireless station there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of}} the river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E

5|$|He {{gained a}} Second Class {{in the first}} History Tripos in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an essay on {{political}} satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained first-class honours in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having doubts about his future as a minister and consulted with the university Law Reader as {{to the possibility of}} a career as a barrister. On the Reader's advice, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of The Guardian and The Observer in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the bar exam. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of £200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to £500, and he was offered a permanent position. While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than a thousand people for an hour. He took {{the first part of the}} Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the paper on real property; he passed it on his second attempt, and was called to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.|$|E

25|$|He {{was called}} to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Inner Temple, 15 May 1889.

25|$|After graduation, {{he worked}} as a country editor of a weekly newspaper, reading law with the goal of {{entering}} <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. He abandoned both professions, instead taking a clerkship at the Treasury Department in 1861, at an annual salary of $1,200. He remained a clerk until President Ulysses S.

25|$|Wood {{completed}} his legal studies and {{was called to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Middle Temple on 30 April 1874. In June 1874 he lectured about the Ashanti War at the Royal United Services Institute. From September 1874 to February 1878 he was at Aldershot, first as Superintendent of Garrison Instruction, then as Assistant Quartermaster-General. In 1877 he declined command of Staff College, recommending George Colley, who also declined.|$|E
25|$|After {{university}} {{he served}} in the honorary post of Judge's Marshal. On 2 April 1904 he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Sussex Yeomanry and made Lieutenant on 1 April 1908.

He bought Amazon as a houseboat in 1968 but realised her potential {{and took her}} back to sea in 1971; this unique vessel is still operating in the Mediterranean.

In 1903, he began a career in law, being called to <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Inner Temple. After his father succeeded as Earl of Bessborough in 1906, Ponsonby used the courtesy title of Viscount Duncannon.|$|E

25|$|The Wairoa is {{the main}} river feeding the Kaipara from the north. Thirty {{kilometres}} upstream, the town of Dargaville was established. The stretch of water to Dargaville is broad and straight and provides an easy to navigate route into what were then kauri forests in the interior. Dargaville flourished as kauri fell and mills buzzed. Immigrants from Britain and Croatia were attracted to the area. Ships up to 3,000 tons carried timber and logs out along the Wairoa to defy <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> harbour entrance before continuing on, usually to another New Zealand port or across the Tasman to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Gilray {{was educated}} at Otago Boys' High School, {{and went on}} to the University of Otago, where he was {{president}} of the student union.

Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1907, Gilray went to University College, Oxford, graduating Master of Arts with second-class honours in 1910. Between 1910 and 1913 he taught at Mill Hill School, London. He was called to <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Middle Temple in 1913 and then returned to New Zealand, practising law at Milton.|$|E
25|$|In mid-March, Farragut {{began moving}} his ships across <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{mouth of the}} river. This was not without incident; the depth of water {{was found to be}} only 15 feet (4.5 meters) instead of the 18 feet (5.8 meters) that was expected. At least one ship that the Administration wanted in the expedition, USS Colorado, drew too much to get across. To Farragut, the most serious problem {{presented}} by the failed effort to bring Colorado into the river was not the reduction in the force he had available, but rather the lost time. With Colorado subtracted, the fleet inside the bar included six ships and twelve gunboats.|$|E
