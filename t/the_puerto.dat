5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{currently}} {{receive the}} greatest attention {{in regards to}} conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> Rican Parrot Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist <b>the</b> <b>Puerto</b> Rican parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.|$|E
