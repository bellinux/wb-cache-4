However, an anonymous source involved in the game's development reaffirmed Buxer's statements and said Jackson was involved before the scandals came to light in August 1993, and that his contributions remained in the game with Jackson choosing to remain uncredited. The source specified that the musical theme for Carnival Night Zone {{was one of the}} pieces Jackson contributed to.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër {{was removed}} from office by John Paul II for alleged sexual {{misconduct}} with younger men who were students in his care.

25|$|A British study {{published}} in 1996 found 62 cases of alleged ritual abuse reported to researchers by police, social and welfare agencies from the period of 1988 to 1991, representing a tiny proportion of extremely high-profile cases compared to the total number investigated by the agencies. Anthropologist Jean LaFontaine spent several years researching ritual abuse cases in Britain {{at the behest of}} the government, finding that all of the cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse that could be substantiated were cases where the perpetrators' goal was sexual gratification rather than religious worship. Producing several reports and the 1998 book Speak of the Devil, after reviewing cases reported to police and children's protective services throughout the country LaFontaine concluded that the only rituals she uncovered were those invented by child abusers to frighten their victims or justify <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> occurred outside of the rituals, indicating the goal of the abuser was sexual gratification rather than ritualistic or religious. In cases involving satanic abuse, the satanic allegations by younger children were influenced by adults, and the concerns over the satanic aspects were found to be compelling due to cultural attraction of the concept, but distracting from the actual harm caused to the abuse victims.|$|E
