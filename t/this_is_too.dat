5|$|The exact {{location}} of the olive grove of Kountouras in Messenia is unknown; the Greek version of the Chronicle records, apart from the owner's name (Kountouras or the variant form Koundouron), a location name Kepeskianous (Κηπησκιάνους), while a variant form is recorded as Kapsikia (Καψικία). Efforts {{have been made to}} identify the locality, with some linking it with the modern village of Kapsia west of Mantinea in Arcadia, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> far from the reported area of the battle based on the sources, and furthermore olive trees do not grow in the region.|$|E

25|$|Glass solders are {{frequently}} used in electronic packaging. CERDIP packagings are an example. Outgassing {{of water from}} the glass solder during encapsulation was a cause of high failure rates of early CERDIP integrated circuits. Removal of glass-soldered ceramic covers, e.g., for gaining access to the chip for failure analysis or reverse engineering, is best done by shearing; if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> risky, the cover is polished away instead.|$|E
25|$|The Aragonese led AlfonsoI the Battler seize Zaragoza {{and most}} of the central lands of the Ebro. The siege of Zaragoza lasts from 22 May 1118 to 18 December 1118. The {{garrison}} has 20 mangonels and is supported by a determined militia. As a result of a plea for help of 3 December the Almoravid governor of Valencia sends a relief force, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> small to help. Lleida only remains in Muslim hands because it is tributary to Barcelona.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} are largely pictorial but include many abstract signs. The inscriptions {{are thought to}} have been mostly written from right to left (because there are several instances of the symbols being compressed on the left side, as if the writer was running out of space {{at the end of the}} row there), but sometimes follow a boustrophedonic style. The number of principal signs is about 400. Since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> large a number for each character to be a phonogram, it is taken that it must, instead, be a logo-syllabic script.|$|E

For a second time, Arthur is faced with a police investigation and with all the evidence stacked against him, he is soon arrested and ends the year behind bars. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> much for Arthur, who is unable to face the prospect of serving a prison sentence for a crime he didn't commit, and upon his imprisonment he suffers a mental breakdown and refuses any contact with his family.|$|E
500|$|The brittle ice zone {{typically}} returns poorer quality samples {{than for}} the rest of the core. [...] Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. [...] Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. [...] In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. [...] Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. [...] Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1m lengths in the hole. [...] Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.|$|E
500|$|The third single, [...] "All My Life", was {{released}} on March 17, 1998, and was the duo's most successful song. JoJo wrote the song about his daughter but originally intended it for another artist. In an interview with MTV, he said, [...] "The song was originally supposed to be used for… another artist, a female artist on A Records. But we listened to it after {{we got out of}} the studio and it was like, 'I'm keeping this, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> hot. [...] "All My Life" [...] peaked at number one on the Hot 100 and R/Hip-Hop Songs, tying a record set by The Beatles by jumping from 15th to first on the U.S. charts. It was also a number-one song in Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. It peaked at second on the Norwegian Singles Chart, third on the Flanders Belgium Singles Chart, fourth on the Swedish Singles Chart and the Swiss Singles Chart, eighth on the UK Singles Chart, 11th on the Wallonia Belgium Singles Chart, 12th on the Austrian Singles Chart, and 43rd on the French Singles Chart. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and gold by IFPI Sweden. [...] "All My Life" [...] was nominated for Best R Video at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|As they {{completed}} the song's demo, Tommy Mottola, CEO of Sony Music Entertainment and Carey's fiancé, {{walked into the}} studio. After hearing the rough version of the song, on which they were still working on, he became interested in it, asking what project the song belonged to. Carey explained to him the concept and how the song {{would be used for}} the film Hero. Mottola immediately took an intense liking to the song, responding, [...] "Are you kidding me? You can't give this song to this movie. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> good. Mariah, you have to take this song. You have to do it." [...] Initially, Carey was guided by the subject of the film, but Afanasieff acknowledged that she made it a very personal song after deciding to keep it, altering some of the lyrics, key and instrumentation. After their decision to keep [...] "Hero," [...] Afanasieff went back to the staff at Epic and told them that they had failed {{to come up with a}} song for the soundtrack. Estefan never heard the tune was originally meant for her, and the song that ended up in the soundtrack was [...] "Heart of a Hero," [...] written, produced and recorded by Luther Vandross. In the following weeks, after completing the song, Afanasieff spoke with Bronson about its recording, and how Carey created several versions of the track: ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} began Gordon-Cumming {{discussed}} the tapestry with Wilson, commenting {{that the different}} colours of the cloth {{made it difficult to}} see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the [...] system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered [...] "My God, Berkeley, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> hot!" [...] further explaining that [...] "the man next to me is cheating!" [...] After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson [...] "this is too hot". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Stanley Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green baize. Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.|$|E

2500|$|If {{this claim}} (which Marx {{originally}} {{intended as a}} criticism of German Idealism and the more moderate Young Hegelians) is still {{more or less the}} case in the 21st century, as many Marxists [...] would claim, then Marxist theory is in fact the practical continuation of the philosophical tradition, while much of philosophy is still politically irrelevant.

2500|$|JWST's {{primary mirror}} is a 6.5-meter-diameter {{gold-coated}} beryllium reflector with a collecting area of 25m2. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> large for existing launch vehicles, so the mirror {{is composed of}} 18 hexagonal segments, which will unfold after the telescope is launched.

[...] Subsequent to this initial configuration they will only need occasional updates every few days to retain optimal focus. This is unlike terrestrial telescopes like the Keck which continually adjust their mirror segments using active optics to overcome the effects of gravitational and wind loading, and is made possible {{because of the lack of}} environmental disturbances of a telescope in space.|$|E
