At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E
5|$|Greenwald left WWE and a {{full-time}} wrestling career in April 2005.
