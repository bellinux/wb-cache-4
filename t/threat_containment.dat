40|$|Target or <b>threat</b> <b>containment</b> is {{a process}} where a team of robots forms a {{particular}} formation around a target so that it gets engulfed in it. The robots under consideration run decentralized Swarm-Algorithms that make them cooperate with each other using their local sensing capabilities. Previous {{work in this area}} has dealt with robot formations and single <b>threat</b> <b>containment</b> where the target is either fixed or dynamic. In either case the same targets exist throughout the containment process. The challenge is to use such collaborative robots to contain multiple targets that appear at random times, and expire after some time. In order to accommodate multiple threats, an algorithm named MUltiple <b>Threat</b> <b>Containment</b> Algorithm (MUTCA), was proposed and analyzed in this work. Upon sensing threat occurrences, the robots split up and attempt to surround all threats with a circular formation. MUTCA is based on Quadratic Artificial Potential Functions (QAPF). Multiple QAPFs are carefully designed to allow robots to surround the threats evenly and to avoid collisions. Using MUTCA, each robot periodically and independently calculates the sum of forces acting at their location in order to decide its movements. This work investigates the capabilities and limitations of autonomous robots utilizing MUTCA via simulation using MAHESHDAS - a simulator developed to simulate autonomous robots. Application specific success rates were examined for robot sensor capabilities and parameters used by QAPF. Though working well for the tested scenarios, MUTCA {{has been found to be}} sensitive to application specifics and sensor errors.

40|$|The Web service {{technology}} {{allows the}} dynamic composition of a workflow (or a business flow) by composing {{a set of}} existing Web services scattered across the Internet. While a given Web service may have multiple service instances taking part in several workflows simultaneously, a workflow often involves a set of service instances that belong to different Web services. In order to establish trust relationships amongst service instances, new security protocols are urgently needed. Hada and Maruyabma [3] presented a session-oriented, multi-party authentication protocol to resolve this problem. Within a session their protocol provides a commonly shared session secret for all the service instances, thereby distinguishing the instances from those of other sessions. However, individual instances cannot be distinguished and identified using the session secret. This leads to vulnerable session management and poor <b>threat</b> <b>containment.</b> In this paper we present a new protocol design for multi-party authentication in which each service instance of a given session is provided with a unique identifier.

40|$|Severe {{accident}} management (SAM) in Nordic Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) employs ex-vessel core debris coolability. Core melt {{is poured}} {{into a deep}} pool of water {{and is expected to}} fragment, quench, and form a coolable debris bed. Success of the strategy is contingent upon the melt release mode from the vessel, which determine conditions for (i)  the debris bed coolability, (ii)  steam explosion that present credible <b>threats</b> to <b>containment</b> integrity. The characteristics of melt release are determined by the in-vessel accident scenarios and phenomena subject to aleatory and epistemic uncertainties respectively. A consistent treatment of these uncertainties requires Integrated Deterministic Probabilistic Safety Analysis (IDPSA). We employ the concepts and approaches described in Risk Oriented Accident Analysis Methodology (ROAAM) for development of a probabilistic framework (ROAAM+) that is based on extensive uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in risk quantification. Direct application of such fine-resolution models for extensive sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is often unaffordable. We use “surrogate models” (SMs) that provide computationally efficient approximations for the FMs. In this work we demonstrate an approach to the development of Core relocation SM based on the MELCOR code as the full model (FM). We discuss the development of the database of the FM solutions, data mining and post-processing of the results for SM development. Extensive sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is carried out using the FM and implications of the analysis are discussed in detail. We demonstrate how the connection between different stages of severe accident progression is made in ROAAM+ framework for Nordic BWRs. QC 20161031 APRI-...|$|R
40|$|The 1997 and 2008 UN Conventions on anti-personnel {{mines and}} cluster munitions mobilised the {{clearance}} {{of millions of}} square metres of land globally. Yet despite this success, concerns persist. Whilst areas of land made safe and numbers of items destroyed were systematically monitored, understanding the impact on livelihoods remains a goal of practitioners and policy-makers alike. This research explores the impact mines and cluster munitions, and their clearance, had on 66 households and in two communities in southern Lebanon. These communities lie within 20 kilometres of the United Nations delineated Blue Line: the militarised Lebanon/Israel border. The research had academic and applied objectives. It was guided by the following questions: How does contamination impact upon livelihoods? What impact does clearance have on livelihoods and local development spaces? And, how can any variations in the impact of contamination and clearance on livelihoods, within and across the field sites, be explained? Methodologically, it explored the implications of analysing livelihood change in insecure contexts. Literatures on livelihoods, well-being, disaster risk reduction, post-colonialism and political economy of conflict are used to ground the analysis and discussion: drawn together through the lenses of vulnerability and resilience. The findings highlight that contamination and clearance unsettled and reworked livelihoods and livelihood security in the field sites. Contamination caused costs to livelihood capitals. It led to <b>threat</b> avoidance, <b>containment</b> and confrontation mechanisms, to cope with, and adapt to, its presence. Where clearance followed, benefits associated with ‘undoing’ the costs of contamination on livelihood were found. Yet, impact was differentiated between and within communities. Further impact was non material as well as material and linked {{to an understanding of}} livelihoods as resistance. This highlights the need to see the impact of mine action ‘in the round’; attuned to context and the economic, political, social and cultural dimensions and insecurities of everyday living that this may imply. This may unsettle the assumptions upon which the conceptualisations of impact, and hence how it is primarily examined, have appeared to fall within mine action. ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{combustion}} {{may represent}} a <b>threat</b> to <b>containment</b> integrity in a VVER- 440 / 213 plant owing to the combination of high pressure and high temperature. A study {{has been carried out}} using the GASFLOW 2. 1 three-dimensional CFD code to evaluate the hydrogen distribution in the containment during a beyond design basis accident. The VVER- 440 / 213 containment input model consists of two 3 D blocks connected via one-dimensional (1 D) ducts. One 3 D block contains the reactor building and the accident localization tower with the suppression pools. Another 3 D block models the air traps. 1 D ducts represent the check valves connecting the accident localization tower with the air traps. The VVER pressure suppression system, called ''bubbler condenser,'' was modeled as a distributed heat sink with water thermodynamic properties. This model accounts for the energy balance. However, it is not currently possible to model dynamic phenomena associated with the water pools (e. g., vent clearing, level change). The GASFLOW 2. 1 calculation gave detailed results for the spatial distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and gas concentrations. The range and trend of the parameters are reasonable and valuable. There are particularly interesting circulation patterns around the steam generators, in the bubbler tower and other primary system compartments. In case of the bubbler tower, concentration and temperature contour plots show an inhomogeneous distribution along the height and width, changing during the accident. Hydrogen concentrations also vary within primary system compartments displaying lower as well as higher (up to 13 - 20 % and higher) values in some nodes. Prediction of such concentration distributions was not previously possible with lumped parameter codes. GASFLOW 2. 1 calculations were compared with CONTAIN 1. 2 (lumped parameter code) results. Apart from the qualitatively similar trends, there are, for the time being, quantitative differences between the results concerning, for example, pressure histories, or the total amount of steam available in the containment. The results confirm the importance of detailed modeling of the containment, {{as well as of the}} bubbler condenser and sump water pools. The study showed that modeling of hydrogen distribution in the VVER- 440 / 213 containment was possible using the GASFLOW 2. 1 code with reasonable results and remarkable physical insights...|$|R

This work explores distributed and low overhead algorithms for patrolling and <b>threat</b> <b>containment</b> within a region sparsely populated with few robots. The robots patrol the area without the global knowledge of the region, but each is equipped with an omni-directional range finder and a positioning system for keeping track of its location and metering distance and directions of events. This study presents the extent of effectiveness and limitations of utilizing a limited number of robots patrolling an unknown wide-spread region. A set of three algorithms was developed. All algorithms assume the use of artificial potential fields (APFs) for collision avoidance with other robots and the walls as well as to approach the threat. The algorithms differ in two ways; whether or not the robots have a limited memory of past events and the way the robots maneuver from one patrol target location to another. The next patrol target location can be derived randomly or based on past events. The past events include previously sensed robot locations, target locations, and walls. The algorithms are analyzed in terms of the time it takes for the robots to detect and neutralize threats within the surveillance region. Simulations via MATLAB are conducted to investigate the tradeoffs due to factors such as the number of robots, the size of the region, and the frequency of threats. The results show that the three algorithms perform comparably on average, achieving reasonable effectiveness given the inherent limitations that are lacking in the global information about the environment...|$|E

To determine the existence of the extended-spectrum β-lactamase enzymes in Nnewi, 250 clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species from Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi were identified by conventional methods. These include Klebsiella species (96), E. coli (90), Pseudomonas species (37), Enterobacter species (13), Proteus species (6), Citrobacter species (5) and Salmonella species (3). Antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing was carried out on all the isolates by the disc diffusion method. Extended Spectrum Beta- lactamases were detected by the double disc synergy test. High level of antimicrobial resistance was noted in test organisms against some of the antimicrobial drugs: Ampicillin + Cloxacillin (93. 2 %), Tetracycline (90. 8 %), Streptomycin (82. 4 %), and Nalidixic acid (62 %), and low level of resistance was observed against Ofloxacin (26. 4 %), Cefotaxime (28. 8 %) and Nitrofurantoin (28. 8 %).

40|$|Abstract — This work investigates a multithreat {{containment}} problem where a team {{of autonomous}} robots cooperate to contain occurring threats. The robots aim to form circles around multiple threats that appear at random times and expire after a certain time. Containing single static threats has been studied, yet extending it to the dynamic regime with threat lifetime overlapping presents additional complex challenges. An algorithm named MUltiple <b>Threat</b> <b>Containment</b> Algorithm (MUTCA) is proposed and analyzed in this work. MUTCA is designed for simplicity and based on Quadratic Artificial Potential Functions (QAPF) {{and the use of}} random walks. Multiple QAPFs are carefully designed to allow robots to move toward the threats, to avoid collisions, and to surround the threats evenly. This work investigates the capabilities and limitations of autonomous robots utilizing MUTCA via simulation using MAHESHDAS- a simulator developed to simulate autonomous robots. Application specific success rates are examined for various scenarios and robot sensor capabilities. MUTCA has been found to work well with sufficient robots that have moderate capabilities, but is sensitive to application specific parameters. I...|$|E
40|$|Most {{attacks on}} {{computer}} and software systems {{are caused by}} threats to known vulnerabilities. Part {{of the reason is}} {{that it is difficult to}} possess necessary broad and deep knowledge of security related strategic knowledge to choose mitigating solutions suitable for a specific application or organization. This paper presents three patterns that use goaloriented concepts to capture knowledge of security problems and their corresponding mitigating solutions. Each pattern captures three kinds of problems, including undesirable outcome that negatively affects a security goal, threat that could lead to an undesirable outcome, and vulnerability that could be exploited by a threat. Alternative mitigating solutions are captured in relation to the problems, including vulnerability risk transfer, threat prevention, <b>threat</b> <b>containment,</b> undesirable outcome recovery, and undesirable outcome impact prevention and control. The alternatives are identified with consequences against other non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as cost and usability, which are then used as selection criteria in associated selection patterns. The patterns illustrate how knowledge of security incidents and security standards may be captured and used to help avoid the security problems suffered by TJX in one of the largest credit card theft incident in history...|$|E
40|$|Target {{surveillance}} in a bounded {{environment has}} been a growing focus {{in the past few}} years, particularly with recent world events prompting the need for environmental monitoring using automated surveillance. Scenarios exist where the goal {{is to be able to}} track targets within a certain distance and yet maintain a proper distribution of the surveillance units to provide field coverage. Previous works in this area using mobile robots as the surveillance units have made assumptions of a global awareness capability provided by a central controller. Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) have been used in cooperative robots and swarm research for applications such as <b>threat</b> <b>containment</b> and related formation control without as much focus on the surveillance tasks. This thesis aims to extend the use of APFs to the concept of Regional Target Surveillance in a distributed algorithm among cooperative robots, with the utilization of Voronoi cells to aid in coverage control. This investigation proposes a system to utilize only the necessary number of robots with local awareness capability. Each of these robots integrates the use of a centroid force and a target force to provide a balanced coverage and target tracking performance. This is accomplished by implicitly defining three circular regions of responsibility for each robot, namely, the full sensing region, the target tracking region, and the centroid calculation region. The target tracking region is within the full sensing region and encompasses the centroid calculation region. The centroid calculation region is used to define the Voronoi cells and thus the centroid of the responsible field of each robot. By adjusting the relative size of the three regions, the system accomplishes implicit target handoff between robots, and, in turn, provides an overall balance between regional target tracking and environmental coverage for the surveillance goal. Matlab simulation results show that with a proper balance in the tradeoff between the tracking and coverage performance, the algorithm is scalable to larger field sizes with a similar robot density, while successfully accomplishing the surveillance tasks...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with deterministic and probabilistic analysis of ex-vessel melt risks in a Swedish designed BWR plant. The focus is placed on a station blackout (SBO) scenario, with immediate SCRAM and subsequent activation of the main steam valve isolation (at 52 s). Four sequences were examined in detail to study the effect of two valves systems related to the operation of ADS (Automatic Depressurization System), and cavity flooding by water from suppression pool. The later action constitutes a cornerstone in the SAM (Severe Accident Management) strategy adopted in the newer Swedish and Finnish BWR plants. On the deterministic side, the US NRC MELCOR code was used to simulate the BWR system behaviours and phenomena that govern <b>threats</b> to the <b>containment</b> integrity. Remarkably, time factor (such as delays in instrumentation activation) {{was found to be}} of paramount importance to the sequence’s dynamics and consequences. On the probabilistic side, a review of methods in Level 2 Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) based on classical concepts of event trees-fault trees reveals that the existing methods ignore the time dependence, suggesting the need and potential value to explore a dynamic approach. In the present work, a recently-developed concept of dynamic fault trees was adopted. Specifically, dynamic structures were built into the tree’s branching points to enable capturing the effect of time-competing events in Level 2 PRA (severe accidents). The technique was successfully implemented in Matlab. The method was then applied to four cases to compute the probability of occurrence of various key events. For the four cases studied, MELCOR results show the time for cavity rupture due to debris ablation varied between the 17. 5 h and the 30. 5 h. They also show direct containment heating (DCH) when ADS fails to operate. Interestingly, the probabilistic results exhibit associative and competitive behaviours in the two valve systems, confirming the need to account for their interdependence...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{accidents}} in a Light Water Reactor (LWR) {{have been a}} subject of intense research {{for the last three}} decades. The research in this area aims to reach understanding of the inherent physical phenomena and reduce the uncertainties in their quantification, with the ultimate goal of developing models that can be applied to safety analysis of nuclear reactors, and to evaluation of the proposed accident management schemes for mitigating the consequences of severe accidents.  In a hypothetical severe accident there is likelihood that the core materials will be relocated to the lower plenum and form a decay-heated debris bed (debris cake) or a melt pool. Interactions of core debris or melt with the reactor structures depend to a large extent on the debris bed or melt pool thermal hydraulics. In case of inadequate cooling, the excessive heat would drive the structures' overheating and ablation, and hence govern the vessel failure mode and timing. In turn, <b>threats</b> to <b>containment</b> integrity associated with potential ex-vessel steam explosions and ex-vessel debris uncoolability depend on the composition, superheat, and amount of molten corium available for discharge upon the vessel failure. That is why predictions of transient melt pool heat transfer in the reactor lower head, subsequent vessel failure modes and melt characteristics upon the discharge are of paramount importance for plant safety assessment.  The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to develop a method for reliable prediction of melt pool thermal hydraulics, namely to establish a computational platform for cost-effective, sufficiently-accurate numerical simulations and analyses of core Melt-Structure-Water Interactions in the LWR lower head during a postulated severe core-melting accident. To achieve the goal, an approach to efficient use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been proposed to guide and support the development of models suitable for accident analysis.   The CFD method, on the one hand, is indispensable for scrutinizing flow physics, on the other hand, the validated CFD method can be used to generate necessary data for validation of the accident analysis models. Given the insights gained from the CFD study, physics-based models and computationally-efficient tools are developed for multi-dimensional simulations of transient thermal-hydraulic phenomena in the lower plenum of a LWR during the late phase of an in-vessel core melt progression. To describe natural convection heat transfer in an internally heated volume, and molten metal layer heated from below and cooled from the top (and side) walls, the Effective Convectivity Models (ECM) are developed and implemented in a commercial CFD code. The ECM uses directional heat transfer characteristic velocities to transport the heat to cooled boundaries. The heat transport and interactions are represented through an energy-conservation formulation. The ECM then enables 3 D heat transfer simulations of a homogeneous (and stratified) melt pool formed in the LWR lower head.  In order to describe phase-change heat transfer associated with core debris or binary mixture (e. g. in a molten metal layer), a temperature-based enthalpy formulation is employed in the Phase-change ECM (so called the PECM). The PECM is capable to represent natural convection heat transfer in a mushy zone. Simple formulation of the PECM method allows implementing different models of mushy zone heat transfer for non-eutectic mixtures. For a non-eutectic binary mixture, compositional convection associated with concentration gradients can be taken into account. The developed models are validated against both existing experimental data and the CFD-generated data. ECM and PECM simulations show a superior computational efficiency compared to the CFD simulation method.  The ECM and PECM methods are applied to predict thermal loads imposed on the vessel wall and Control Rod Guide Tubes (CRGTs) during core debris heatup and melting in a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) lower plenum. It is found that during the accident progression, the CRGT cooling plays a very important role in reducing the thermal loads on the reactor vessel wall. Results of the ECM and PECM simulations suggest a high potential of the CRGT cooling to be an effective measure for severe accident management in BWRs. QC 20100812 </p...|$|R
