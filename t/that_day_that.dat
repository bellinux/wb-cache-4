5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, Rivers briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass. There is no official rule against serving both as the chair and a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, Rivers officially announced she would run for the office. On March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week. That was confirmed when Rivers released a statement later <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> said Rivers {{would not be a}} candidate. Rivers cited the time commitment and desire to stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal. She was considered the front runner for the office.|$|E
5|$|In late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders {{spent the}} winter in Texas, {{animosity}} developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri {{as the leader of}} a group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers throughout central Missouri. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate sympathizers in Missouri saw his actions as justified, possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces. In September 1864 he led a raid on Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, they were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In {{what became known as the}} Centralia Massacre--possibly the war's deadliest and most brutal guerrilla action--his men killed 24 Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> killed more than 100 Union militiamen. A month later Anderson himself was killed in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson: some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, but for others his actions cannot be separated from the general lawlessness of the time.|$|E

5|$|The Bridge Creek–Moore tornado {{was part}} of a much larger outbreak, which {{produced}} 71 tornadoes across five states throughout the Central Plains on May 3 alone, along with an additional 25 that touched down a day later in some of the areas affected by the previous day's activity (some of which were spawned supercells that developed on the evening of May 3), stretching eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. On the morning of May 3, in its Day 1 Convective Outlook for the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for severe weather, as a dry line that stretched from western Kansas into western Texas approached a warm, humid air-mass over the Central Plains; the conditions ahead of the dry line and a connecting trough positioned over northeastern Colorado appeared to favor the development of thunderstorms later <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> would contain large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and isolated tornadoes.|$|E

However, the team did not back down without a fight. On July 22, the team acquired third baseman Alberto Callaspo from the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Sean O'Sullivan and a pitching prospect. Although this move received mild criticism, general manager Tony Reagins certainly silenced the critics three days later, on July 25; it was on <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> he pulled off a trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Angels acquired ace starting pitcher Dan Haren in exchange for pitchers Joe Saunders and Rafael Rodríguez, and prospects Patrick Corbin and Tyler Skaggs; it is notable that all four pitchers the Angels sent in return are left-handed pitchers.|$|E
