5|$|Financial {{irregularities}} at the WHH led in 1862 to {{the company}} suffering severe financial difficulties, resulting in the resignation of Ward Jackson from the boards of the WHH and the Cleveland Railway.

5|$|In 1720 {{the first}} Act of Parliament <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> {{improvements}} to the river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire. The act was dated 23 March 1720 and authorised work between Frodsham bridge and Winsford bridge. Rates for tolls were set, which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met, and profits were then {{to be used to}} maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire. Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, a separate Act was obtained on 7 June 1721 <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> {{improvements to the}} River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.|$|E

5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> the modernisation works—to head off some of the encroachment.|$|E

5|$|On 2 July 1847 the North Staffordshire Railway Act was passed. The act was {{necessary}} {{was because of}} problems encountered {{with the construction of}} the Crewe branch. The opportunity was taken <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> several other deviations and small branches. It also consolidated the previous acts and importantly, forced the NSR to ensure that all lines were completed by specifying that ordinary dividends were not to exceed 5% until the Churnet Valley and Willington lines had been opened.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as {{the channel}} was inadequate, {{and there were}} fish weirs and water mills on its course. Three {{attempts}} were made to obtain an Act of Parliament <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare a new survey and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. Their report was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that the improvements would cost £9,979.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the victory at Tobruk, Rommel persuaded Hitler <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> an attack on Egypt instead of Malta, over Kesselring's objections. The {{parachute}} troops assembled for Operation Herkules were sent to Rommel. Things went well at first, with Rommel winning the Battle of Mersa Matruh, but just as Kesselring had warned, the logistical difficulties mounted and the result was the disastrous First Battle of El Alamein, Battle of Alam el Halfa and Second Battle of El Alamein. Kesselring considered Rommel to be a great general leading fast-moving troops at the corps level of command, but felt that he was too moody and changeable for higher command. For Kesselring, Rommel's nervous breakdown and hospitalisation for depression {{at the end of the}} African Campaign only confirmed this.|$|E

5|$|The 1866 Act {{also gave}} the Anglesey Central Railway (ACR) the right <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> Dickson to lease or work the line, or to lease or sell {{the line to}} the LNWR. Dickson did indeed {{undertake}} to operate services. He requested permission from the LNWR to run services through to Bangor, but they refused, and passengers had to continue to change at Gaerwen. The act authorised a branch from Rhosgoch to Cemaes, {{but this was not}} built. The Fairlie engine Mountaineer was in use on the line in April 1866, but by October 1867 it was in use on the Neath and Brecon Railway, of which Dickson was also the contractor and whose traffic he was working. The Neath and Brecon's 0-6-0 Miers also operated on the ACR, under the name Anglesea. Neither of those engines was considered successful.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Singapore raised {{fears of}} a Japanese {{invasion}} of the Australian mainland and the Government became concerned about the Army's ability to respond. Although large, the forces in Australia contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response, most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, appealed to the United States for assistance. As Japanese forces advanced through Burma towards India in early 1942, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, attempted to divert the 6th and 7thDivisions while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> this movement.

5|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} for the Bridgewater Canal to reach Salford from the Duke of Bridgewater's coal mines in Worsley, by remaining on the north bank of the Irwell. Work began in 1759, but it was quickly decided to alter the route by building a masonry aqueduct to carry the waterway over the Irwell at Barton, and terminate instead in Manchester, {{to the south of}} the river. A Bill <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> the new route was presented to parliament on 13 November 1759, and in January the following year Brindley travelled to London to give evidence before a parliamentary committee in support of the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Vorster was so {{angered by}} the raid that he {{immediately}} terminated Operation Polo, under which members of the South African forces had secretly stayed on in Rhodesia after their official withdrawal in August 1975. This and the general international condemnation after Nyadzonya made the Rhodesians very hesitant <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> any more external operations, even covertly, while the peace process crawled on during {{the last months of}} 1976. Two further unsuccessful rounds of negotiations took place between September and December: first the United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger thrashed out a deal, which in September the Rhodesians accepted and the nationalists rejected, then from October to December 1976 the government and nationalist parties took part in the abortive British-mediated Geneva Conference.|$|E
5|$|With costs {{much higher}} than anticipated, work ceased in June 1811. After much deliberation, {{it was decided to}} {{continue}} construction, and to obtain a third Act of Parliament <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> increased charges for carriage of goods. By 1812, progress was being made, but was hampered by the need for rock cuttings at Holcombe Rogus. Leakage also meant that some sections needed to be lined with puddle clay. Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials, which can still be seen beside the canal, close to the Waytown Tunnel. Fenacre Bridge and Fossend Bridge were constructed at Burlescombe, where culverts were also needed to manage the streams. At a total cost of £244,505, the canal was opened on 25 August 1814, when the first boat travelled from Lowdwells to Tiverton, laden with coal.|$|E
5|$|Baronial castles were {{of varying}} size and sophistication; some were classed as a caput, or the key stronghold {{of a given}} lord, and were usually larger and better {{fortified}} than the norm and usually held the local baronial honorial courts. The king continued to exercise the right to occupy and use any castle in the kingdom in response to external threats, in those cases he would staff the occupied castles with his own men; the king also retained the right <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> {{the construction of new}} castles through the issuing of licenses to crenellate. It was possible for bishops to build or control castles, such as the important Devizes Castle linked to the Bishop of Salisbury, although this practice was challenged on occasion. In the 12th century the practice of castle-guards emerged in England and Wales, under which lands were assigned to local lords on condition that the recipient provided a certain number of knights or sergeants for the defence of a named castle. In some cases, such as at Dover, this arrangement became quite sophisticated with particular castle towers being named after particular families owing castle-guard duty.|$|E
