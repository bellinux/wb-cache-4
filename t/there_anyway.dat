500|$|Upon arrival, Lamason, as ranking officer, {{demanded an}} {{interview}} with the camp commandant, Hermann Pister, which he was granted. He insisted that the airmen be treated as POWs under the Geneva Conventions and be sent to a POW camp. The commandant agreed that their arrival at Buchenwald was a [...] "mistake" [...] but they remained <b>there</b> <b>anyway.</b> The airmen were given the same poor treatment and beatings as the other inmates. For the first three weeks at Buchenwald, the prisoners were totally shaved, denied shoes and forced to sleep outside without shelter in one of Buchenwald's sub-camps, known as 'Little Camp'. Little Camp was a quarantine section of Buchenwald where the prisoners received the least food and harshest treatment.|$|E
500|$|Having {{been killed}} during the end of The Lion King, Scar's {{appearance}} and presence in its sequel [...] (1998) is, naturally, quite limited in comparison. Story-wise, however, his role remains vital. Upon Scar's demise, a rivaling pride of lions known as the Outsiders decide to remain loyal to him. The pride is led by Scar's most faithful follower, Zira. Since Scar had no children of his own, Zira's son Kovu is chosen to serve as Scar's heir. Simba banishes the Outsiders to the Outlands, and forbids his daughter Kiara from going there. She goes <b>there</b> <b>anyway,</b> however, and meets and befriends Kovu. Meanwhile, Zira trains Kovu to murder Simba, but when he becomes an adult, he has {{a change of heart}} as he begins to develop feelings for Kiara.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water <b>there</b> <b>anyway?</b> These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1996, {{the band}} {{performed}} two concerts before crowds of 250,000 at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, while more than 2,500,000 fans had applied for tickets. The dates {{were to be}} the zenith of Oasis's popularity, and both the music press and the band realised {{it would not be}} possible for the band to equal the event. By this time however, there was much instability and internal conflict emerging between the band members. On 23 August 1996, vocalist Liam Gallagher refused to sing for an MTV Unplugged performance at London's Royal Festival Hall, pleading a sore throat. Though he did attend the concert, he spent the evening heckling Noel from the upper level balcony. Four days later, Liam declined to participate in the first leg of an American tour, complaining that he needed to buy a house with his then girlfriend Patsy Kensit. He re-joined the band a few days after for a key concert at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, but intentionally sang off-key and spat beer and saliva during the performance. The following day, The Sun led with the front page headline [...] "America sickened by obscene Liam's spitting rampage." [...] Amongst much internal bickering, the tour continued—with Liam—to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Noel finally lost his patience with his brother and announced he was leaving the band. He later admitted [...] "If the truth be known, I didn't want to be <b>there</b> <b>anyway.</b> I wasn't prepared to be in the band if people were being like that to each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is {{we are going to}} bring in a large group of people that we like, and we try to empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is <b>there</b> <b>anyway</b> I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching me in the face, I can’t cut them." ...|$|E

[...] Bunn also revealed that The Fearless Defenders #10 will be a dance issue explaining, [...] "I’m not sure how many dance comic books are out <b>there</b> <b>anyway,</b> but definitely not dance super hero comics. I’ve tried to do different things with the book from the beginning and this issue will definitely live up to that ideal." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 7 RAR mascot and nickname, [...] "the Pigs", has a {{long and}} celebrated history within the {{battalion}}. According to Corporal Roy Savage:The single men of 3 RAR were sent to Puckapunyal {{to form a new}} battalion, 7 RAR. I arrived there on 11th November 1965. At first there were only regular soldiers. We used to keep the boozer open all weekend having the cooks bring our meals <b>there.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> on my second week there the new CO (Colonel Eric Smith) decided to inspect his new battalion area on a Sunday. He immediately closed the boozer. The next day he called a muster parade of the whole battalion and commenced to tell us what he thought of us. Half way through his speech he said and I quote, 'You are nothing but a mob of pigs'. Then from the back rank someone called out 'oink oink'. From that time onwards we became the Pig Battalion.|$|E
