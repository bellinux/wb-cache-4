5|$|The White House is {{connected}} to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in {{the centre of the}} building was originally an open passageway. It now houses <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock {{on the front of the}} building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws for me when I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|Bramshill {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, {{although}} another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|The château was {{disadvantaged}} by {{its lack}} of {{a view of the}} Seine. Moreover, Madame du Barry considered <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>areas</b> to be inadequate. She thus decided to build, surveying the valley of the Seine, a small separate house that would include <b>reception</b> rooms, <b>the</b> famous Pavillon de Louveciennes.|$|R

50|$|In 2002, <b>the</b> studio's <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> {{was moved}} from {{the eastern end of}} the tower block off Atherton Street, to the western end inside the {{compound}} so visitors passed through a secure area before accessing <b>the</b> non-public <b>reception.</b> <b>The</b> old <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> became unused. Granada unveiled plans to move into the bonded warehouse adjacent to Granada House in 2003. One of the four studios would be decommissioned as part of the move, but this plan was postponed as plans for the BBC to move production to Manchester emerged.|$|R
5|$|Excavations for {{construction}} of the building's foundations started in October 1961 and the first concrete pour occurred in November 1961. The building was not completely finished by the time Perth hosted the Commonwealth Games in November 1962, however the builders rushed to finish the ground, eighth, and 10th floors in time so that foreign dignitaries could be entertained in <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

About two-thirds of the building caught fire as a result of the explosion after a natural gas pipe was blown open, and <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> was completely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|For Question Time on 22 October 2009, the BBC {{invited the}} leader of the British National Party, Nick Griffin, onto the {{programme}} for the first time causing heated public debate and strong protests outside the studios. Television Centre had its security breached with around 30 anti-fascist protesters storming <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> and several hundred protesters gathering outside. Police and security staff were forced to close gates leading into the Centre and form barriers to prevent any further breaches of security.|$|E

An original wall-mounted bronze artwork depicting the historical evolution of the wheel is retained in the entrance foyer. Within the front portico, L1 is a mezzanine level retaining original balustrades: iron near the southern glazing and battened timber above <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area.</b> Mounted on the end wall of the lift foyer facing the front entrance is Communications, a large artwork by Leonard Shillam.|$|E
25|$|The pendopo of a Kalang {{house is}} still kept as <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> of the house. However, instead of {{employing}} a traditional joglo-styled roof {{typical of a}} traditional pendopo, the roof often employs additional front-facing gable, marking the front-center part of the pendopo. Omah Prayadranan or Ndalem Natan (1857 or 1927) in Kotagede, and a Kalang house in Jalan Slamet Riyadi, Surakarta, employs a porch-like protrusion to the pendopo, known as the kuncungan. The kuncungan of a Kalang house in Jalan Urip Sumoharjo, Surakarta has transformed into a porte-cochère while the pendopo took form of a terrace. The kalang house of B.H. Noeriah, or Omah Tembong (1862) has been completely enclosed with wall, stained glassed windows and door, giving {{it a quality of}} a sunroom.|$|E

25|$|The longest-running {{school in}} the Jewellery Quarter is the Municipal School for Jewellers and Silversmiths, {{now part of the}} Birmingham Institute of Art and Design, run by Birmingham City University, on Vittoria Street. The school was founded in 1888 and moved to its present {{location}} in 1890 when Martin & Chamberlain converted a goldsmith's factory, built in 1865 to a design by J. G. Bland. The top storey was added in 1906 by Cossins, Peacock & Bewlay who also designed the south extension in 1911. The school was acquired by the University of Central England in 1989, along with an adjoining site. They commissioned Associated Architects who designed a further south extension which was constructed between 1992 and 1993. They also redesigned much of the interior, creating a full-height atrium with gallery access to workshops. <b>The</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> can also be used as exhibition space. The building itself consists of a Lombardo-Gothic front, whilst the 1911 extension is of red brick mottled with blue. The project won the 1995 RIBA Architecture Award and the 1996 Civic Trust Award.|$|E
500|$|Clark Interiors and Gensler (a Washington, D.C., design firm) also {{designed}} {{the offices of}} Boston Properties, which moved its D.C. offices into the building.

Realizing the extent of Lennon's injuries, the policemen decided not to wait for an ambulance, immediately carried him into their squad car, and rushed him to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Officer James Moran said they placed Lennon in the back seat.|$|E

500|$|As {{passengers}} and crew headed to the stern, where Father Thomas Byles was hearing confessions and giving absolutions, Titanics band played outside the gymnasium. Titanic had two separate bands of musicians. One was a quintet led by Wallace Hartley that played after dinner and at religious services while {{the other was a}} trio who played in <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> and outside the café and restaurant. The two bands had separate music libraries and arrangements and had not played together before the sinking. Around 30 minutes after colliding with the iceberg, the two bands were called by Captain Smith who ordered them to play in the first class lounge. Passengers present remember them playing lively tunes such as [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band". It is unknown if the two piano players were with the band at this time. The exact time is unknown, but the musicians later moved to the boat deck level where they played before moving outside onto the deck itself.|$|E
500|$|On 20 August, Lennon and Starr, {{working on}} overdubs for [...] "Yer Blues" [...] in Studio 3, visited McCartney in Studio 2, {{where he was}} working on [...] "Mother Nature's Son". The {{positive}} spirit of the session disappeared immediately, and the engineer Ken Scott later claimed: [...] "you could cut the atmosphere with a knife". On 22 August, during the session for [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R.", Starr abruptly left the studio, feeling that his role in the group was peripheral compared to the other members, and was upset at McCartney's constant criticism of his drumming on the track. Abbey Road staff later commented that Starr frequently turned up to the sessions and sat waiting in <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area</b> for the others to turn up. In his absence, McCartney played the drums on [...] "Dear Prudence". Lewisohn also reports that, in the case of [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R.", the three remaining Beatles each made contributions on bass and drums, with the result that those parts may be composite tracks played by Lennon, McCartney or Harrison.|$|E
500|$|Barrett did not {{contribute}} material to the band after A Saucerful of Secrets was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, only one, [...] "Jugband Blues", {{made it to the}} band's second album; one, [...] "Apples and Oranges", became a less-than-successful single; and two others, [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man", were never officially released until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling. Feeling guilty for ousting their friend, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Rick Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, Wright had the awful job of telling Barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while he went off to play a gig. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's The Wall). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that {{a long period of time}} had elapsed, Barrett would ask, [...] "Have you got the cigarettes?". Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>area,</b> waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs and glared at Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on [...] "Remember a Day" [...] (which had been first attempted during the Piper sessions), and also played on [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member, the same day the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated as the record label. Considering Barrett to be the musical brains of the band, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.|$|E
