5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
5|$|If a chest <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> {{already in}} place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis {{tend to be}} worse than when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis {{has been found to}} have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.|$|E

500|$|The {{ships were}} also {{equipped}} with four [...] torpedo <b>tubes.</b> One <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> {{mounted in the}} stern in an above-water swivel mount, two were placed laterally, also above water, and the fourth was in the bow. The torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> supplied {{with a total of}} 10 torpedoes. After the refit, the stern and lateral <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> replaced with [...] weapons, but the lateral torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> submerged. They had 8 torpedoes between them. The bow <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> retained, but also moved below the waterline; it had three torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|Cormus formed of {{irregular}} and loosely anastomosed <b>tubes.</b> There <b>is</b> no cortex {{but sometimes}} it appears {{that some of the}} <b>tubes</b> could <b>be</b> forming one. The wall of the <b>tubes</b> <b>is</b> thick, up to 100 μm. In some areas the <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> hispid.|$|R
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E
5|$|The London Underground, {{commonly}} referred to as the <b>Tube,</b> <b>is</b> the oldest and second longest metro system in the world. The system serves 270 stations and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway. It dates from 1863.|$|E
5|$|The floral <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> {{formed by}} fusion of the basal {{segments}} of the tepals (proximally connate). Its shape is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow in sections Apodanthi and Jonquilla to rudimentary (N. cavanillesii).|$|E
50|$|Martian lava <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with innumerable lava flows and lava channels on the flanks of Olympus Mons. Partially collapsed lava <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> also common.|$|R

50|$|Torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> 533 mm (1.75 ft) diameter, and 8.145 m (26.7 ft) long. <b>Tubes</b> <b>are</b> placed 700 mm (2.3 ft) {{away from}} each other.|$|R
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> metallic or semiconducting.|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E
50|$|Fallopian <b>tube</b> {{obstruction}} <b>is</b> a {{major cause}} of female infertility. Blocked fallopian <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> unable to let the ovum and the sperm converge, thus making fertilization impossible. Fallopian <b>Tubes</b> <b>are</b> also known as oviducts, uterine tubes, and salpinges (singular salpinx).|$|R

50|$|The filled content can {{be easily}} {{squeezed}} out by the pressure of two fingers. The main characteristic of aluminium <b>tubes</b> <b>is</b> the total separation of the contents from the surrounding atmosphere; therefore, such <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> especially suitable for the packaging of highly perishable contents. Aluminium <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> used as packaging technology for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, and technical products.|$|R
5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> an emergent property.|$|E
5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{study on}} {{improving}} the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel by either building another tube or by constructing a bypass was carried out. Based on the study, the turnpike commission planned to replace the deteriorating tunnel with a cut through the mountain. The plans were put on hold in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million. It resurrected the project in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels are improved or a new <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> built rather than building the bypass. These improvements are needed because the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is narrow and deteriorating, with disintegrating ceiling slabs and outdated lighting and ventilation.|$|E

50|$|Cigar <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> used {{to carry}} small numbers of cigars, {{typically}} one or five. The latter <b>tube</b> would <b>be</b> called 5-finger <b>tube</b> and the former 1-finger <b>tube.</b> They <b>are</b> usually made from stainless steel. Cigar <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> normally used when one is {{out for a few}} hours, but if it is necessary to spend longer periods of time out, there <b>are</b> <b>tubes</b> that come with a built in humidifier and hygrometer.|$|R
25|$|The <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> {{relatively}} {{immune to}} vibration, and thus vastly superior on shipboard duty, particularly for navy ships with {{the shock of}} weapon fire commonly knocking the sensitive but delicate galena off its sensitive point (the <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> in general no more sensitive as a radio detector, but was adjustment free). The diode <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> a reliable alternative for detecting radio signals.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1987 {{priced at}} £350, Artemiz is the {{flagship}} tonearm whose design {{was also a}} break from established conventions. The arm and headshell is a one-piece construction; the large-gauge aluminium tube interference-fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is the bearing. The <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> flat {{at the other end}} to provide for mounting the cartridge. The arm is finished in a matt resonant paint. Unusually, there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional lever-operated lift/lower assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{consistent}} surface state after each test, the boiling surface was prepared in the same manner, i.e., the stainless steel <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> finished with emery paper 400 and copper <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> polished with abrasive compound, next the test <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> placed in an ultrasonic cleaner for 1 h. Finally, the boiling surface was cleaned by water jet.|$|R
40|$|Although sliding {{indirect}} inguinal hernias {{containing the}} ipsilateral ovary and fallopian <b>tube</b> <b>are</b> {{not uncommon in}} infant girls, sliding hernias containing uterus with both ovaries and fallopian <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> extremely rare. At surgery, a 5 -month-old infant girl {{was found to have}} an indirect hernia in which the uterus and fallopian <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> sliding components with a wide deep inguinal ring...|$|R

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} used because the {{high-temperature}} superconductors are too brittle for normal wire forming processes. The <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> metal, often silver. Often the <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> heated to react {{the mix of}} powders. Once reacted the <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> sometimes flattened to form a tape-like conductor. The resulting wire is not as flexible as conventional metal wire, but is sufficient for many applications.|$|R
