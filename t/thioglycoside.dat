50|$|Some {{representative}} {{examples of}} Crich’s β-mannosylation {{are shown in}} Scheme 3. It is noteworthy that, with this method in hand, primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols (9, 12, and 13) all serve as glycosyl acceptors effectively in terms of yields and selectivity. In a recent version, the β-mannosylation of <b>thioglycoside</b> 14 and its analogues were examined to prepare sterically hindered glycosides, in which PhSOTf (or other newly developed sulfur-type oxidants) served as a convenient reagent for the in situ generation of the glycosyl triflate from 14, thus facilitating the reaction.|$|E
50|$|The polymer-supported {{synthesis}} of β-mannosides {{based on the}} Crich’s protocol has also been studied in the same laboratories. As shown in Scheme 4, diol 17 was first reacted with polystyrylboronic acid (18) to offer the bound donor 19, in which 4,6-O-phenylboronates served as the torsionally disarming protecting group. With that, activation of the <b>thioglycoside</b> 19 was readily achieved, and the coupling reaction with the acceptor alcohol underwent smoothly to provide the bound β-mannoside 20. After removal of the excess reagents and byproducts from the resin, 20 was then treated with aqueous acetone to release 4,6-diol 21. Overall, this is a powerful method for solid-phase {{synthesis of}} β-mannosides, which has great potential to be further extended, was established.|$|E
5000|$|In formal terms, a {{glycoside}} is any molecule {{in which}} a sugar group is bonded through its anomeric carbon to another group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an O-glycoside), N- (a glycosylamine), S-(a <b>thioglycoside),</b> or C- (a C-glycoside) glycosidic bond. According to the IUPAC, the name [...] "C-glycoside" [...] is a misnomer; the preferred term is [...] "C-glycosyl compound". [...] The given definition is the one used by IUPAC, which recommends the Haworth projection to correctly assign stereochemical configurations. Many authors require in addition that the sugar be bonded to a non-sugar for the molecule to qualify as a glycoside, thus excluding polysaccharides. The sugar group is then known as the glycone and the non-sugar group as the aglycone or genin part of the glycoside. The glycone can consist of a single sugar group (monosaccharide) or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide).|$|E

50|$|Common donors in {{oligosaccharide}} synthesis are glycosyl halides, glycosyl acetates, thioglycosides, trichloroacetimidates, pentenyl glycosides, and glycals. Of {{all these}} donors, glycosyl halides are classic donors, which played a historical {{role in the}} development of glycosylation reactions. <b>Thioglycoside</b> and trichloroacetimidate donors are used more than others in contemporary glycosylation methods. When it comes to the trichloroacetimidate method, one of the advantages is that there is no need to introduce heavy metal reagents in the activation process. Moreover, using different bases can selectively lead to different anomeric configurations. (Scheme 2) As to the thioglycosides, the greatest strength is that they can offer a temporary protection to the anomeric centre because they can survive after most of the activation processes. Additionally, a variety of activation methods can be employed, such as NIS/ AgOTf, NIS/ TfOH, IDCP (Iodine dicollidine perchlorate), iodine, and Ph2SO/ Tf2O. Furthermore, in the preparation of 1, 2-trans glycosidic linkage, using thioglycosides and imidates can promote the rearrangement of the orthoester byproducts, since the reaction mixtures are acidic enough.|$|E

It is known that O-glycosidase is able to split O-glycosides, including of O-arylglycosides, in biological systems. Enzymes capable of cleaving the thioglycosidic bond are less common in nature and occur mainly in plants [9, 10].

Also, <b>thioglycosides</b> have gained widespread use in carbohydrate chemistry as inhibitors of O-glycosidase and O-glycosyltransferase inhibitors [13]. Nevertheless, unlike intensively investigated O-glycosides of MDP, S-glycosides have received relatively little attention. Currently, only three S-alkyl glycosides of MDP, namely, methyl and butyl β-glycosides and hexadecyl S-glycoside, have been obtained [8], although 1 -thiomuramyl dipeptide itself was found to possess the adjuvant effect close to the action of muramyl dipeptide [8].
