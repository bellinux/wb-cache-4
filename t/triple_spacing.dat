40|$|As the Semantic Web (SW) {{is being}} {{automatically}} populated with {{large number of}} RDF triples scalability issues related to wide scale reasoning occur. We believe these difficulties are due {{to the use of}} global reasoning engines, which carry all the load of collecting and handling all relevant triples, and they can be alleviated by distributing the load of the reasoning amongst the meaningful entities represented by the triples themselves. Therefore, as an application of a knowledge representation model based on Differences and on top of the <b>triple</b> <b>space</b> computing model, we introduce Active <b>Triple</b> <b>Spaces,</b> <b>triple</b> <b>spaces</b> managing <b>triples</b> acting as differences, i. e. processes subscribing to active queries and presenting their result as a new triple.

Un-fortunately, it usually defines the data shared by these devices in a syntactic level, showing a lack of expressiveness. During the last decade, the Semantic Web (SW) has aimed to solve these problems by adding logic to the Web to make it machine-understandable and by therefore enhancing the interoperability of the applications using it. The SW {{is used in the}} <b>Triple</b> <b>Space</b> Computing paradigm, which proposes a blackboard model where semantically described knowledge is shared between different devices in a completely RESTful, and consequently WoT compliant, manner. This paradigm’s shared blackboard can be implemented using many strategies, from centralized to completely distributed. In this work, we compare and analyze the behaviors of these two extreme cases in several simulations which try to represent common IoT scenarios. Finally, we propose an improvement of the completely distributed strategy by enabling the gossiping between devices...|$|R
