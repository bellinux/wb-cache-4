5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin balanced rudders behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central rudder used on earlier ships.

5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. The {{last few}} days had been {{monotonous}} and Finucane was eager to fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who had put his age down so he was accepted for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane took off and headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which blew a piece of fuselage into the cockpit and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was able to claim one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E

Anderson inspected the route on 18 March, the last tram ran on 19 March, and trolleybuses commenced operation the next day.

25|$|The {{simplest}} single-engine {{steering system}} in mechanical terms, and almost universally used on early tank designs, was {{the combination of}} a brake and a clutch connected to steering controls. The controls were normally a pair of vertical handles, one for each track. Pulling on a handle disengaged the clutch, releasing that track and causing it to slow down. Further motion of the handle increasingly applied the brake to that track, allowing the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> to be adjusted.|$|E

25|$|Botnica {{was one of}} {{the first}} icebreakers to be {{equipped}} with Azipod propulsion, ABB's brand of electric azimuth thrusters developed in Finland. The two 5 MW Azipod VI1600A units considerably improve the maneuverability of the icebreaker — the tactical diameter of the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> in open water is less than the overall length of the ship. This is especially useful during escort and assistance operations in difficult ice conditions when the icebreaker has to operate at close proximity to other vessels at low speeds. Together with three 1,150-kW Brunvoll FU-80-LTC-2000 variable-pitch bow thrusters the azimuth thrusters also allow dynamic positioning during offshore operations. The bow thrusters are not used in ice.|$|E
25|$|Although some of {{the basic}} design {{elements}} of the aircraft were from an earlier generation, the Hurricane proved to be a match, to an extent, for the Luftwaffes Messerschmitt Bf 109E. In his book, Duel of Eagles, British ace Peter Townsend, who flew Hurricanes with No. 85 Squadron RAF during the Battle of Britain, provides examples demonstrating how the Hurricane's superior turning ability could offset the Bf 109's higher speed. This small <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> often allowed a well flown Hurricane to get onto the tail of a 109 even more quickly than a Spitfire, assuming a 109 pilot was unwise enough to be lured into a turning match. Against the Hurricane was the aircraft's relatively slow acceleration and a top speed some 10–30mph (16–48km/h) slower, depending on altitude. This meant that the 109 pilot often held the initiative when it came to breaking off or attacking during combat. At higher altitudes especially, the Hurricane was hard-pressed to keep up with a well flown 109, or even a Bf 110.|$|E

25|$|The export range, from 1948 {{were the}} OPS2, OPS3 and OPS4. They also {{featured}} the O600 engine and synchromesh gearbox as introduced, but air brakes were optional. The OPS2 shared the PS2's 17ft 6in wheelbase, although the frames, springs and axles were heavier duty than their home market equivalents, bodies {{could be as}} long as 29ft 3in where laws permitted, the OPS3 was introduced {{at the same time}} as the OPS2 but had a 19ft wheelbase for bodies up to 31ft long. This variant would not have met UK <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> requirements when the new 30ft length was legalised in 1950. Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the Irish state transport undertaking uniquely took Tigers of both PS2/13 and OPS3 type, these become the last vehicles of over 300 to be numbered in the P series that had started with Dublin United Transport's first Tiger in 1935. Walter Alexander took some OPS2 coaches as well as PS2s but these are believed to have been a frustrated export order. The OPS4, had a 21ft 6in wheelbase for a bodied length of 35ft, Duple produced a batch of fifteen LOPS4/3 with Park Royal metal frames in 1949 for coach operators in Buenos Aires and a single coach to the same outline for Gibraltar motorways. Production of the 'overseas' Tiger concentrated in the 1950s on the OPS4/5 variant with exposed radiator, O680 engine, air brakes and Pneumocyclic gearbox as standard, the final (post 1967) versions were coded OPS4A/15 following updates in the Titan range and a rationalisation of nomenclature and components. The last Tiger OPS4s were delivered to South African fleets in 1970, some of these were still working at the turn of the century.|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the Fuji class was derived {{from that of the}} British s, albeit about [...] smaller.

The two ships of the class were almost identical even though they were designed by two different naval architects, Yashima by Philip Watts and Fuji by George C. Mackrow. The primary difference was that Yashima had her deadwood cut away aft and was fitted with a balanced rudder. This made her almost a knot faster than her sister and gave her a smaller <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> at the cost of a weaker stern that required careful attention when drydocked lest it sag.|$|E
500|$|Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, was tasked {{to provide}} a {{combination}} of seaworthiness and speed for these ships. He gave the ships a high length-to-beam ratio to increase their speed, but this made the design less manoeuvrable. To offset this, {{the ends of the}} ships were narrowed to allow the rudder as much authority as possible even though this reduced buoyancy at the ends of the ship and caused the weights to be concentrated {{in the middle of the}} ship. The compromise proved to be successful and the design did not have a large <b>turning</b> <b>circle.</b> Admiral G. A. Ballard considered them to be [...] "a definite step forward in the shipbuilder's art." [...] Ballard considered their only real defect to be unsteadiness as gun platforms as their metacentric height was fairly high, which caused them to roll excessively, and they pitched quite a bit in a head sea due to the lack of buoyancy in the narrow bow. Bilge keels were later installed during one of their refits to curb their rolling motion.|$|E

25|$|One {{solution}} to the steering problem is to use two separate drivetrains, each driving one track. Steering is accomplished by changing gears on one and not the other.
