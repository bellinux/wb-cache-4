50|$|In 1909 Legros and Knowles {{created a}} new Service {{department}} for Iris Cars Ltd, headquartered in Aylesbury and headed by George Augustus Mower. It was associated with Mower's Bifurcated Rivet and <b>Tubular</b> <b>Rivet</b> Company, on the Mandeville Road, Aylesbury.|$|E
50|$|Hindi {{served a}} stint as {{shipping}} and receiving clerk at Carol Stream, Illinois-based Allied Rivet (then called Allied <b>Tubular</b> <b>Rivet),</b> a company that manufactures tubular rivets, before purchasing the company in the mid-1980s, becoming its president, and moving it to Geneva, Illinois. In 1992, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for {{a seat in the}} Illinois General Assembly against Tom Cross.|$|E
25|$|In April, Patapsco Bridge and Iron Works {{completed}} {{the bridge and}} viaducts over Little Pipe Creek, a total length of 705 feet, {{the deck of the}} bridge with a span of 135 feet, 60 feet above low water; trestling consisting of 19 spans, eleven on the Frederick and eight on the Carroll county side of the creek was made of rolled iron plates, forming six angular <b>tubular</b> columns,..."securely <b>riveted</b> together,and apparently of great strength".|$|R
50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece internally threaded and counterbored <b>tubular</b> <b>rivet</b> that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{attending}} college, at age 23 Hindi switched {{to being a}} shipping and receiving clerk at Carol Stream, Illinois-based Allied <b>Tubular</b> <b>Rivet</b> (later renamed to Allied Rivet), a company that manufactures tubular rivets. The company made millions of rivets for air ducts, toys and other products. He became the operator of the company's manufacturing shop. His father-in-law bought the company in 1982 and sold it to Hindi about five years later. After paying $240,000 to buy the company, Hindi became its president.|$|E
50|$|Semi-tubular rivets (also {{known as}} tubular rivets) {{are similar to}} solid rivets, except they have a partial hole (opposite the head) at the tip. The purpose of this hole {{is to reduce the}} amount of force needed for {{application}} by rolling the tubular portion outward. The force needed to apply a semitubular rivet is about 1/4 of the amount needed to apply a solid rivet. Tubular rivets are sometimes preferred for pivot points (a joint where movement is desired) since the swelling of the rivet is only at the tail. The type of equipment used to apply semi-tubular rivets range from prototyping tools to fully automated systems. Typical installation tools (from lowest to highest price) are hand set, manual squeezer, pneumatic squeezer, kick press, impact riveter, and finally PLC-controlled robotics. The most common machine is the impact riveter and the most common use of semitubular rivets is in lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, HVAC duct work, mechanical products, and electronics. They are offered from 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) in diameter (other sizes are considered highly special) and can be up to 8 inches (203 mm) long. A wide variety of materials and platings are available, most common base metals are steel, brass, copper, stainless, aluminum and most common platings are zinc, nickel, brass, tin. Tubular rivets are normally waxed to facilitate proper assembly. An installed <b>tubular</b> <b>rivet</b> has a head on one side, with a rolled over and exposed shallow blind hole on the other.|$|E
40|$|A {{blind rivet}} nut is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic deformation due to axial compression of the rivet nut {{in such a way}} that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the rivet nut after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round <b>tubular</b> <b>rivet</b> is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the {{blind rivet nut}}. The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the rivet nut and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed rivet nut was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a blind rivet nut. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Self-Piercing Riveting (SPR) is a {{high-speed}} mechanical fastening technique {{which does not}} require pre-drilling. During SPR, a <b>tubular</b> <b>rivet</b> is driven through the top sheet, piercing the bottom sheet without breaking through it, accompanied by flaring of the legs in the bottom sheet {{under the guidance of}} a suitable die. The rivet material should have adequate hardness to pierce the sheets, and sufficient ductility to deform in the bottom sheet without cracking, thus producing a mechanical interlock between the sheets. An increase in strength or thickness of the ply materials narrows down the operating window in terms of joint quality and performance. It is important to know the residual stress distribution arising from the riveting process, and its dependence on the ply materials properties. to ensure a sound joint. In this study, four different joints consisting of two different hardnesses of materials and two different hardnesses of rivets were examined. Residual stresses were measured on the strain scanner Kowari at ANSTO at selected critical locations. The study revealed that the hardness of the rivet and a ply material influence the magnitude and distribution of compressive residual stress in the rivet joint. It was observed that the maximum compressive residual stress occurred in the rivet leg in the transverse direction relative to plane of sheet. The challenges related to the application of neutron diffraction technique to the measurements of residual stress in the riveted joints are presented and discussed...|$|E
