5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in Hong Kong in 1992 to generally positive audience reception, {{but it was not}} as commercially successful as Woo's previous action films, such as A Better Tomorrow and The Killer. Reception from western critics was much more positive; many critics and film scholars have come to proclaim its action scenes as among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> filmed. In 2007, a video game sequel titled Stranglehold was released, which {{is in the process of}} being made into a film.|$|E
5|$|A similar outcome {{followed}} in the 200m World finals. In the semi-final, Gatlin outpaced Bolt – the Jamaican at 19.95 and the American at 19.87. Despite such slow times prior to Beijing, Bolt delivered in the final with his fifth fastest run ever for the 200m at 19.55 seconds. Gatlin failed to reach his early season form and finished almost two-tenths of a second behind Bolt. Bolt's four consecutive wins over 200m at the World Championships was unprecedented and established him clearly as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> sprinter at the competition.|$|E
5|$|Fischer, {{eligible}} as U.S. Champion, {{decided against}} {{his participation in}} the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal, taking {{himself out of the}} 1966 World Championship cycle, even after FIDE changed the format of the eight-player Candidates Tournament from a round-robin to a series of knockout matches, which eliminated the possibility of collusion. Instead, Fischer embarked {{on a tour of the}} United States and Canada from February through May, playing a simultaneous exhibition, and giving a lecture in each of more than 40 cities. His 94% winning percentage over more than 2,000 games is one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> achieved. Fischer declined an invitation to play for the U.S. in the 1964 Olympiad in Tel Aviv.|$|E

5|$|In {{his senior}} season, Cabral won the 2007 boys CIAC State Open Cross Country Championships. He {{also won the}} New England Cross Country Championships. At the Foot Locker National Cross Country Championship at Balboa Park in San Diego, Cabral {{finished}} 8th {{with a time of}} 15:19, which tied <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> finish by a Connecticut runner. In May, his 4:09.80 became the best mile time of the school year for an American high schooler. Cabral placed second in the 10,000 meters (30:50.28) at the 2008 USA Junior Track & Field championships, qualifying him for the at the IAAF World Junior Championships in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after the}} US tour the band {{performed}} at the Altamont Free Concert at the Altamont Speedway, about 50 miles east of San Francisco. The biker gang Hells Angels provided security, and a fan, Meredith Hunter, was stabbed and beaten to death by the Angels after they realised that he was armed. Part of the tour and the Altamont concert were documented in Albert and David Maysles' film Gimme Shelter. As {{a response to the}} growing popularity of bootleg recordings (in particular Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, recorded during the 1969 tour), the album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! (UK 1; US 6) was released in 1970; it was declared by critic Lester Bangs to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> live album.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{satellite}} {{rights were}} sold to Gemini TV of Sun Network for 55 million in mid-July 2014. Suresh Babu revised the sale to 200 million, as a three film package including Gopala Gopala and Bhimavaram Bullodu, both co-produced by him. Drushyam had its global television premiere on 15 February 2015 at 6 p.m. IST. It registered a TRP rating of 18.61 which was reportedly one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> {{in the history of}} Telugu cinema. In comparison, two other successful Telugu films of 2014, Race Gurram and Manam, which incidentally also aired on Gemini TV, registered a TRP rating of 15.6 and 15.7 respectively.|$|E

5|$|Gay {{holds the}} US {{record in the}} 100m with 9.69s, making him the joint second fastest sprinter, along with Yohan Blake, {{in the history of}} the event after Usain Bolt. His 19.58s makes him history's sixth fastest 200m runner and the USA's fourth fastest. In 2010 Gay was a member of the fifth-fastest 4 x 100m relay team in history, running a 37.45s with {{teammates}} Trell Kimmons, Wallace Spearmon and Michael Rodgers in Weltklasse Zürich 2010. His sprint combination of 100m and 200m in 9.84s and 19.62s, run over two days in 2007, was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> combo at that time. During the Tom Jones Memorial Classic in Gainesville on April 17, 2010 Tyson Gay clocked 44.89 in the 400m event and became the first man in history to dip under 10.00 in the 100m, under 20.00 in the 200m and under 45.00 in the 400m.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 {{the tournament}} severed its {{relationship}} with Toyota. Grupo Santander, {{one of the largest}} banks in the world, became the sponsor of the Copa Libertadores, and thus the official name changed to Copa Santander Libertadores. In that season, LDU Quito became the first team from Ecuador to win the Copa Libertadores after defeating Fluminense 3–1 on penalties. Goalkeeper Jose Francisco Cevallos played a key role, saving three penalties in the final shootout in what is considered one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> final series in the competition's history. It was also the highest-scoring final {{in the history of the}} tournament. The biggest resurgence of the decade happened in the 50th edition of the Copa Libertadores and it was won by a former power that has reinvented itself. Estudiantes de La Plata, led by Juan Sebastián Verón, won their fourth title 39 long years after the successful generation of the 1960s (led by Juan Sebastián's father, Juan Ramón). The pincharatas managed to emulate their predecessors by defeating Cruzeiro 2–1 on the return leg in Belo Horizonte.|$|E
5|$|In its {{summary of}} the 1927 season, Wisden named him as Kent's best batsman and noted an {{improvement}} in his defensive technique. Against Lancashire, who retained the County Championship, he scored 260 in three hours' batting, the highest score of his career. The Lancashire bowling attack included former Australian Test bowler Ted McDonald, regarded as the fastest bowler {{in the world at}} the time and feared by most county batsmen. Many critics praised Chapman's innings as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> played. He was selected to lead the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's for the first time, and led representative sides in two of the three Test trials held that season; the press judged his captaincy to be good. He totalled 1,387 runs in first-class games at an average of 66.04, the highest aggregate and average of his career. The Kent captaincy became available {{at the end of the}} season, but Chapman was not appointed; according to Chapman's biographer, David Lemmon, he was probably approached but was unable to dedicate the necessary time to the position.|$|E

5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} women soccer players of all time, and by many as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever,</b> Hamm was an athletic, dynamic, and technically gifted striker, renowned for her speed, skill, footwork, stamina, and ability on the ball, as well as her consistency. An excellent, agile dribbler, she was highly regarded for her control, as well as her grace, pace, and elegance in possession. A prolific goalscorer, she was known for her powerful and accurate striking ability, although she was also a creative and hard-working forward, and a team player, who was equally capable of assisting many goals for her teammates, due to her accurate passing, and was also willing to aid her teammates defensively when possession was lost. She was capable of playing in any offensive position.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka, and produced by Tetsuhisa Tsuruzono. Artwork was produced by manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki, while the music was composed by Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players {{have been able to}} play Seiken Densetsu 3 due to an unofficial English fan translation, first released in 2000. Seiken Densetsu 3 received considerable acclaim from reviewers, who praised the graphics as among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> made for the Super Famicom and the gameplay as an improved version of its predecessor's. The plot received mixed reviews by critics, who found the overlapping stories to be interesting and to enhance replayability, but the characters and plotlines themselves to be flat and clichéd. Overall, the game is considered by some critics to be a Super Famicom classic {{and one of the best}} role-playing games of the 16-bit era.|$|E
5|$|For {{the sixth}} {{time in his}} major league career, Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and {{featured}} the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo {{home run in the}} eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; the AL squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in {{the span}} of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals, the second of which – a dribble past three players – was {{acclaimed}} as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> in the competition. Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final, where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory. Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league's top assist provider with 18. He finished the season with 53 goals and 24 assists in all competitions, becoming Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ever</b> due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E
