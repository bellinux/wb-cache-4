In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money {{could not be used}} for margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.|$|E

Before leaving, he tells a horror story implementing all their fears as a way <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> not to let fear control their lives. This inspires Jim and Pam to stop their argument and Erin to talk to Andy about her feelings.|$|E
5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who {{had never}} been {{particularly}} popular among his followers—tried <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> {{that she should be}} their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and it was here that Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.|$|E

Spider-Man locates these sandmen <b>to</b> <b>convinces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> unify. Sandman's evil persona merges with his innocent and gentle personas, but Sandman's good one rebuffs the evil one. Because Sandman's mind can handle his personality in separation {{for only a}} limited time, he loses his ability to retain himself, crumbling and blowing away, leaving Spider-Man to ponder {{the nature of his}} scuddled foe.|$|R
5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> that Blonde {{planned to}} kill them and steal the {{diamonds}} for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E
5|$|Parry {{arranged}} for the league chairmen to vote on 18 May 1992. Four days earlier BSkyB and ITV made their formal presentations to the chairmen; Chisholm hinted to his audience that BSkyB would increase their offer. This concerned Dyke, who on the weekend before the vote arranged an urgent meeting with East. They both telephoned the ITV companies <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> to raise their collective bid. It came {{to a total of}} £262 million – £155 million of which spread out over five years, for 30 live games per season. East presented their new offer to the chairmen and Parry.|$|E

He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> of the mistake.|$|E
5000|$|A popular {{explanation}} for why people join new religious movements {{is that they have}} been [...] "brainwashed" [...] or subject to [...] "mind control" [...] by the NRM itself. This explanation provides a rationale for 'deprogramming', a process in which members of NRMs are illegally kidnapped by individuals who then attempt <b>to</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reject their beliefs. Professional deprogrammers therefore have a financial interest in promoting the 'brainwashing' explanation. Academic research however has demonstrated that these brainwashing techniques [...] "simply do not exist".|$|R

5|$|The {{refusal of}} the {{military}} leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front {{to send them to}} the Grisons as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to a pause in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{position of the}} Low Countries, located between France and Germany on the uncovered flanks of their fortification lines, made the area a logical route for an offensive by either side. In a 20 January 1940 radio speech, Winston Churchill tried <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> not to wait for an inevitable German attack, but to join the Anglo-French Entente. Both the Belgians and Dutch refused, even though the German attack plans had fallen into Belgian hands after a German aircraft crash in January 1940, in {{what became known as}} the Mechelen Incident.|$|E

He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, {{stressing}} their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
50|$|Cospaia was {{an early}} centre of tobacco {{production}} within Italy, using 25 hectares of fertile soil to grow it. Each citizen was awarded a silver coin by the church <b>to</b> help <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> continue farming tobacco.

5|$|Since its {{founding}} Nea Salamina sought to develop friendly {{relations with the}} Turkish Cypriots in Famagusta, and Turkish Cypriots (including Siekkeris, Nita and Moustafa) played during the early 1950s. When the team joined the CFA, it played against Turkish teams (including Demir Sports, Gençlik Gücü and the Mağusa Türk Gücü) in the second division. When Turkish Cypriot clubs began withdrawing from CFA tournaments of CFA in late 1955, the club tried <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> to continue and Turkish players remained welcome in Nea Salamina. In 1962 Kallikas {{was transferred to the}} club, and in 1970 Neziak (of Turkish origin) was also transferred. In 2004 Turkish Cypriots Imam and Oulousoi were transferred to Nea Salamina, the first Turkish Cypriot footballers in the CAF in thirty years.|$|E
5|$|The key to Ferdinand was {{the threat}} to Genoa. Intelligence {{intercepts}} showed that the Abwehr (German military intelligence) listed {{it as one of}} the main areas they expected an Allied attack. It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region, which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance. German commanders identified both Genoa and southern France as the only logical targets, so the task for Allied double agents was <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> that the former was the true goal. The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself, with a tactical deception. The Dragoon fleet travelled on a course toward Genoa until late at night on 14 August, when they turned west toward their real target.|$|E
5|$|Though they aren't very {{enthusiastic}} {{at the idea}} of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them.</b> Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien's prose is unpretentious and straightforward, taking as {{given the}} {{existence}} of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter-of-fact way, while often introducing the new and fantastic in an almost casual manner. This down-to-earth style, also found in later fantasy such as Richard Adams' Watership Down and Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn, accepts readers into the fictional world, rather than cajoling or attempting <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> of its reality. While The Hobbit is written in a simple, friendly language, each of its characters has a unique voice. The narrator, who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides (a device common to both children's and Anglo-Saxon literature), has his own linguistic style separate {{from those of the}} main characters.|$|E
5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either {{was in danger of}} losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E

Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders {{to attack the}} rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most {{probably not going to}} easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia {{by the time of the}} offensive. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.|$|E

5|$|In 1456, Skanderbeg's ally, Janos Hunyadi, died, and his son, Mathias Corvinus, was crowned King of Hungary. Hunyadi {{had been}} an {{advocate}} for an offensive war against the Ottoman Empire, whereas the Hungarian nobility and his son promoted a defensive war. The next year, however, George Kastrioti Skanderbeg defeated a sizable Ottoman force at the Battle of Albulena (Ujëbardha). Rome had been desperately waiting for such a victory after the Siege of Belgrade, as Pope Calixtus III had wanted to assure himself of the feasibility of a crusade before declaring one. Calixtus thus named Skanderbeg the Captain-General of the Curia; to secure the pope's interests, Skanderbeg sent twelve Turkish prisoners of war that had been captured at Albulena to Rome. Despite seeing his forces defeated the year before, Sultan Mehmed II prepared another force to be sent into Albania. The country had been obstructing his ambitions for empire in the West and he grew restless to defeat Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg sent delegations to several Western European states <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> to stop fighting each other and unite for Calixtus' crusade.|$|E
5|$|Kosmos {{was bought}} by the Skaugen Group in 1988, and on 21 October, Kosmos' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bjørn Bettum and Chairman Otto Grieg Tidemand were fired. The Skaugen Group decided to {{integrate}} Kosmos' shipping and oil-related activities into their group. All other investments, including Norsk Air, were to be sold or closed. At the time, Norsk Air had 140 employees. Norsk Air's CEO, Mr. Røsjodet, made contact with Bård Mikkelsen, who was CEO of Widerøe, to try <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> to purchase Norsk Air. Widerøe was a that time solely occupied with flying on the subsidized regional routes. The company was interested in having some non-subsidized routes to better benchmark its operations. The two largest owners, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE, {{did not want to}} purchase Norsk Air, but the third-largest owner, Fred. Olsen & Co. liked the idea, and bought SAS' and Braathens SAFE's 62.3 percent stake in Widerøe to make the deal possible. Other possible purchasers who had negotiated with Norsk Air were Sterling Airlines, Partnair and Jan Einar Johansen, former owner of Scandi Line.|$|E
5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing, the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band's manager <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until {{they could afford to}} make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E
