5|$|Richard was {{a sickly}} child and his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he wandered through the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander Speedwell, Creeping <b>Tormentil</b> and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), <b>Tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis).|$|E
25|$|The drier {{areas of}} heath have a grassy character, with typical species being {{matgrass}} (Nardus stricta) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Common <b>tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta), dovesfoot cranesbill (Geranium molle), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia) and heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) {{have also been}} recorded, as has the locally rare bird's-foot (Ornithopus perpusillus) and shepherd's cress (Teesdalia nudicaulis).|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the area}} {{is a mixture of}} moorland and meadows. The moorland is {{dominated}} by wood sage, heather and bilberry, while the meadows support a range of wild flowers including mountain pansy, <b>tormentil</b> and harebell. At lower elevations, gorse, bramble and hawthorn appear. The broadleaved Teggsnose Wood covers {{the southern part of the}} hill, with oak, beech, hornbeam, holly and mountain ash.|$|E
25|$|Fen meadow is {{a classic}} Boho habitat type, {{consisting}} of wet fields locally described as a bog meadow, typified by the species devil's-bit scabious, bog thistle, sedges and occasionally <b>tormentil,</b> purple moor grass and rushes (Juncaceae). In Northern Ireland, this type of terrain only covers 0.4% of the total land area and has decreased by 18% over {{the last ten years}} mainly due to the 21% decrease in Fermanagh coverage.|$|E
25|$|The fell is {{actively}} managed by Durham County Council, {{in an effort}} to maintain a broad range of heathland species, including such desirable species as heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile, and common <b>tormentil,</b> Potentilla erecta. Bracken is particularly troublesome because it crowds out the heather and associated species. The County Council has used a combination of burning and selective herbicides to control the bracken, and in 2007 embarked on a three-year trial of a more environmentally-friendly method, using heavy horses to pull a roller that crushes the bracken.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, <b>tormentil,</b> pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E
500|$|On {{the slopes}} of Kilham Hill are {{the remains of a}} shielling, which {{provided}} shelter for shepherds watching over the sheep as they grazed. [...] In summer the hillside is a profusion of purple and blue as wild thyme, cross-leaved heath and harebells come into bloom; foxgloves have colonised the stony ground. [...] A stone cairn crowns the summit, and was found to conceal a Bronze Age cist containing burnt bones. [...] From the summit, there are views over the Milfield Plain, Glendale and the Till Valley, and to Eildon Hill, Yeavering Bell and the Cheviot Hills. [...] Buzzards, kestrels, lapwings and curlews are common, while bilberry, <b>tormentil</b> and heath bedstraw carpet the soil.|$|E

But whatever other company may have been mine, I had the clouds and the water and the insects and the stones--while pimpernel, mousetail, <b>tormentil,</b> the wild strawberry, the feathery grasses seemed to have been made expressly for my delight. Ego-centric Midget that I was! ...|$|E
50|$|Cuscuta europaea L., the European dodder, is {{reported}} to contain 30,000 ppm in the root. Phlobaphenes can be extracted from {{the root of the}} common <b>tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta) as <b>tormentil</b> red.|$|E

50|$|It is Britain's {{only true}} alpine species of butterfly. The larva feeds on moor {{matgrass}} near bogs and springs and the nectar-feeding adult visits bilberry, <b>tormentil</b> and heath bedstraw.|$|E
5000|$|Potentilla erecta (syn. Tormentilla erecta, Potentilla laeta, Potentilla tormentilla, {{known as}} the (common) <b>tormentil,</b> septfoil or erect {{cinquefoil}} [...] ) is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae).|$|E
5000|$|The {{plant is}} {{particularly}} used in herbal medicine as an astringent {{because of its}} tannin content, which is unusually high for a herbaceous plant. This is linked to its use as a red dye, {{which is due to}} the structurally similar phlobaphene content. Phlobaphenes can be extracted from the root of the common <b>tormentil</b> and is known as <b>tormentil</b> red, alongside the triterpene alcohol tormentol. The plant has extremely low toxicity, which was studied by Sergei Shushunov and his team. [...] The roots are a main ingredient of a bitter liqueur from Bavaria and the Black Forest area, called Blutwurz.|$|E
50|$|Slader's Leigh {{is a local}} nature reserve. It is a wildflower meadow {{with plants}} {{including}} devilâ€™s-bit scabious, cowslip, betony, common spotted orchid and <b>tormentil</b> which provide a habitat {{for a range of}} butterflies.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{species are}} called tormentils, {{though this is}} often used {{specifically}} for common <b>tormentil</b> (P. erecta). Others {{are referred to as}} [...] "barren strawberries", which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related but not congeneric Waldsteinia fragarioides.|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} {{woodland}}, scrub and acid grassland. The woodland has spread into {{part of the}} grassland. A wildflower meadow has yellow <b>tormentil</b> and blue bugle, both of which provide food for butterflies. Plants is the scrub area include bird's-foot trefoil and ragged robin.|$|E
50|$|On {{the upper}} slopes the juniper is {{associated}} with species-rich acid grassland, which is dominated by sheep's fescue, Festuca ovina, common bent, Agrostis capillaris, heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile, and <b>tormentil,</b> Potentilla erecta. A locally rare fern, moonwort, Botrychium lunaria {{is one of the}} less common species.|$|E
50|$|Rowley Lodge Field {{is an old}} hay meadow, with flower rich {{grassland}} {{and scattered}} oak trees. It has a good diversity of wild flowers, including great burnet and pignut, both characteristic of unimproved grassland. Patches of acid grassland are dominated by red fescue, and also contain abundant sheep's sorrel and <b>tormentil.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dry heath {{and acid}} {{grassland}} is found on peripheral {{areas of the}} plateau, the former supporting heather, wavy hair - grass (Deschampsia flexuosa) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), and with heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) dominating the latter, with mat-grass (Nardus stricta), wavy hair-grass <b>tormentil,</b> (Potentilla erecta) and heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile).|$|E
50|$|The area to {{the north}} of the central {{embankment}} is heathland which supports Purple Moor-grass and Mat-grass. Petty Whin grows in abundance on this site and is the only recorded occurrence in the county. Heather and European Gorse are also present.
