5|$|Encouraged by <b>the</b> <b>sluggish</b> {{response}} of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels moored in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E

Of particular importance were a reevaluation of the origin of birds that showed them to be closely related to coelurosaurian dinosaurs, reappraisal of dinosaur physiology that suggested they weren't <b>the</b> <b>sluggish</b> cold-blooded animals they'd long been assumed to be, and a recognition that dinosaurs formed a natural group.|$|E

5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, <b>the</b> <b>sluggish</b> and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several {{individuals}} may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than <b>the</b> <b>sluggish</b> Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E

5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); <b>the</b> <b>sluggish</b> pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sluggish</b> and nocturnal coffin ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats, {{where it}} can bury itself during daytime. It can produce a {{powerful}} electric shock reaching 200 volts for attack and defense. This species is a voracious predator that feeds mainly on benthic bony fishes, often tackling fish approaching or exceeding itself in size. On occasion, it may also consume invertebrates and even small penguins and rats. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). The female gives birth to 4–8 pups during summer. The coffin ray can deliver a severe, albeit non-fatal, shock to a human. Not valued commercially, it is very hardy and can usually survive being captured and discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as its population does not seem threatened by human activity.|$|E
5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. <b>The</b> <b>sluggish</b> rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|Yeltsin fired Primakov on 12 May 1999, ostensibly over <b>the</b> <b>sluggish</b> {{pace of the}} Russian economy. Many analysts {{believed}} the firing of Primakov reflected Yeltsin's fear of losing power to a more successful and popular person, although sources close to Yeltsin {{said at the time}} that the president viewed Primakov as being too close to the Communist Party. Primakov himself would have had good chances as a candidate for the presidency. Yevgeny Primakov had refused to dismiss Communist ministers while the Communist Party was leading the process of preparing unsuccessful impeachment proceedings against the president. Ultimately, Yeltsin resigned at the end of the year and was succeeded by his last prime minister, Vladimir Putin. Primakov's dismissal was extremely unpopular with the Russian population: according to a poll, 81% of the population did not approve of the decision, and even among the liberal pro-Western party Yabloko supporters, 84% did not approve of the dismissal.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season, going 1–5, but reversed <b>the</b> <b>sluggish</b> start with a sweep of a four-game road trip, winning games in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Columbus. The Ducks won eight of nine games from there before adversity struck. Defenseman Francois Beauchemin suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament after taking a slapshot off the ankle {{in a game against}} Nashville. Days later, Brian Burke resigned from his position as general manager, handing over the reigns to right-hand man Bob Murray as the former leave to take the same position with the Toronto Maple Leafs just days later. Young forward Bobby Ryan was then called up to the team from the Iowa Chops, the Ducks' AHL affiliate. Reports indicated Ryan was good enough to make the team out of camp but was sent down only due to salary cap restraints. The Ducks continued to play better, but went only 9–13–2 heading to the All-Star break. Three Anaheim Ducks players, Ryan Getzlaf, Jean-Sebastien Giguere and Scott Niedermayer, were all named starters for the All-Star Game, held in Montreal. The Ducks fortunes, however, did not change much after the break, as the team lost four out of their next six games.|$|E
