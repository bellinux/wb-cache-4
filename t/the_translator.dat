5|$|In The Lord of the Rings Tolkien {{pretends to}} be merely <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> of Bilbo and Frodo's memoirs, collectively known as the Red Book of Westmarch. He says that those names and terms in the work (as well in the earlier The Hobbit) that appear in English {{are meant to be}} his purported {{translations}} from the Common Speech.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he focuses}} on the French Revolution, the story ends in the 1880s, shortly after the Second French Empire, closely {{following}} the evolution of society and women (see also Historiography of the French Revolution). Later, he republished what was essentially is the same book but with a different title, in both French and English: La Femme et la mode. Métamorphoses de la parisienne de 1792 à 1892 or Woman and Fashion: Metamorphoses of the Parisienne 1792–1892 in the English version (1892), and Les Modes de Paris. Variations du goût et de l'esthétique de la femme, 1797–1897 (1897). According to the Westminster Review, the English edition was practically a facsimile of the French, and <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> literally wrote the sentences {{to the point of}} unintelligibility.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{uncovered}} after Lie's {{death in}} 1912 suggested that Siti Akbari was {{heavily influenced by}} the earlier Sjair Abdoel Moeloek (1847), variously credited to Raja Ali Haji or Saleha. This tale was transliterated by Arnold Snackey, then later translated into Sundanese. Sources disagree on <b>the</b> <b>translator.</b> The documentarian Christiaan Hooykaas, writing {{in a letter to}} literary critic Nio Joe Lan, suggested that Lie's inspiration had come from a version of Sjair Abdoel Moeloek held in the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences Library in Batavia. Biographer Tio Ie Soei, meanwhile, suggested that the version which inspired Lie was translated in 1873 by Lie's teacher, Sierk Coolsma. According to Tio, Coolsma had based his translation off a stage performance and written it hurriedly, such that it was nearly illegible. As he had better handwriting, Lie purportedly copied the story for Coolsma and kept the original in his own collection. The literary historian Monique Zaini-Lajoubert writes that none of these intermediary versions has been found.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... <b>The</b> <b>translator</b> {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

40|$|By {{adopting}} a different outlook, {{the present study}} endeavors to explain Walter Benjamin’s <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Task {{as an attempt to}} introduce new dimensions to translation studies. To do so, first the intention behind the creation of <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Task was explained through studying key elements proposed in <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Task and searching for instances of these significant factors. It was concluded that <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Task is a reply to the indeterminist nature of languages in the field of translation. Secondly, a translation model based on <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Task was provided and explained. The model used target language lexicon and source language syntax to fully accommodate what was proposed in <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Task. This model was used to produce a sample translation from English to Persian, which was later compared with a published translation. In order to determine the quality of translation, level of determinacy by the ST was assigned as a criterion. To achieve this, each TT was compared with the ST through a back-translation bottom-up analysis and each unit of translation was later categorized as D – determined and positive – or U – undetermined and negative. Finally, the results highlighted the high levels of determinacy by the ST in the sample translation based on the provided model. The published translation, which was a domesticated one, showed lower levels of determinacy by the ST as these kinds of translations are mainly based on the interpretations of the ST.    Keywords: Walter Benjamin, <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Task, pure language, radical literalis...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first to study the English {{translations}} of the : Holy Qur'an, and is mainly concerned with the translators' approach in handling the linguistic (lexical & syntactic), and extra-linguistic (variant readings & cultural) problems of the text. The works that are the subject of the study are those of six English translators (Sale, Rodwell, Palmer, Pickthall, Bell, and Arberry), as well as one of a non-English Muslim translator from Pakistan (Maulana Muhammad Ali). The translators' renderings of the problematic instances are compared with) the expositions of the exegetes (whom <b>the</b> <b>translators</b> have been familiar with), in order to investigate the commentators' influence on <b>the</b> <b>translators.</b> <b>The</b> similarities between the translators' renderings are also checked to find out the degree of dependence between <b>the</b> <b>translators.</b> <b>The</b> <b>translators</b> are found to be heavily reliant on the exegetes. The degree of dependence between <b>the</b> <b>translators</b> is found to be considerable. Some problems have been resolved by means of- the context (i. e. the text as a whole); whereas others are left unresolved. The translations that have been studied are closer to commentaries than the text. The main conclusion is that the Holy Qur’an is untranslatable in the strict sense...|$|R
