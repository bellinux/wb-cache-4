500|$|In 1998, {{after the}} success of Either/Or and [...] "Miss Misery", Smith signed to a bigger record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, {{speaking}} openly of considering suicide, and {{on at least one}} occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, [...] "Yeah, I jumped off a cliff, but let's <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else." ...|$|E
500|$|Tsamere has {{described}} Valenton's profession as [...] "not {{far from the}} style of what I am, [...] very far in substance"; {{he said of the}} character: [...] "Under his generous side as a friend who is keeping his promise ... we have a guy who is ... in the end quite megalomaniacal." [...] The show deals with the theme of death, which Tsamere said is [...] "a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention". He said that he and his co-authors thought that [...] "the most irrefutable reason to go on stage ... was to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> strong". Tsamere {{has described}} how the show changed as the size of its audiences grew and he incorporated improvisations.|$|E
500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E

'You're going to be worth $13 million. You're {{going to be a very}} rich young lady.' I'd say, 'I don't want to talk about the millions of dollars now. Can we put that on hold?

2500|$|Often, what {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a deep philosophical problem will vanish, argues Wittgenstein, and eventually be seen as a confusion about the significance of the words that philosophers use to frame such problems and questions. It is only in this way that it is interesting to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> like a [...] "private language" [...] — i.e., it is helpful to see how the [...] "problem" [...] results from a misunderstanding.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{point that}} Wittgenstein makes against the {{possibility}} of a private language involves the beetle-in-a-box thought experiment. He asks the reader to imagine that each person has a box, inside of which is something that everyone intends to refer to with the word [...] "beetle". Further, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each claims to know what a [...] "beetle" [...] is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word [...] "beetle" [...] could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that each person has something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object [...] "drops out of consideration as irrelevant". Thus, Wittgenstein argues, if we can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something,</b> then it is not private, in the sense considered. And, contrapositively, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we cannot talk about it.|$|E

2500|$|During a Children's Hospital visit near Christmas 1971 a boy {{playing with}} a toy pistol frightened Genie, and when Curtiss tried to reassure her Genie said an {{abbreviated}} version of Curtiss' words, [...] "Little bad boy. Bad gun." [...] About two weeks later Curtiss heard Genie speaking to herself and using an invented gesture for the word [...] "naughty", and when Curtiss asked Genie what she said she repeated, [...] "Little bad boy. Bad gun." [...] out loud for several minutes, marking {{the first time she}} spoke about something in the past. Several months later David and Marilyn overheard her saying, [...] "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." [...] to herself, marking the first time anyone heard her talk about her life before starting to acquire language. She infrequently spoke to others about her early life, but the Riglers said that {{for the rest of the}} time she lived with them she constantly repeated [...] "Father hit" [...] to herself. By the end of her stay, she could also <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> someone else had told her.|$|E
2500|$|One {{attempt to}} define {{goodness}} {{describes it as}} a property {{of the world with}} transcendental realism. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. Plato advocated this view, in his expression {{that there is such a}} thing as an eternal realm of forms or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good. [...] The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint. [...] The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm. [...] The good is the harmony of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of virtues, and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature. [...] The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.|$|E

Smith lives in Malibu, California {{with his second}} wife, {{architect}} Nancy Mack whom he married in 2004 and {{with whom he has}} three sons, Cole (born 2005), Beckett (born 2009) and Dashiell (born 2012). From 1996–1997, Smith was married to Maria St John with whom Smith had a daughter, Manon (born 1996). He also has two other children, Justin (born 1997) and Ava (born 2000) through other relationships and spends time also living in New York. Discussing his relationships and marriages Smith said [...] "I’m the dumper. I fall in love easily, but I get restless. I’ll figure it out one day. Can we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else?" [...] Smith is also an avid fan of his hometown Michigan sports teams. Following the Chili Peppers May 14, 2017 performance in Columbus, OH, Smith sang the University of Michigan fight song [...] "The Victors". Smith's singing of the fight song made national news as the University of Michigan and Ohio State are longtime sports rivals. At shows in Ohio, Smith's drumset has sometimes featured the Michigan Wolverines logo.|$|E

2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by Angular Records founder Joe Daniel and was {{featured}} on the [...] "An Angular Disco" [...] flyer used to advertise Klaxons's first gig. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a [...] "joke that's got out of hand" [...] and that the term was originally ironic, not serious. In reaction to the media overkill of the [...] "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that [...] "We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave {{was to take the}} piss out of the media by making them <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, I appreciate that, but can you tell me more about new rave?" [...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Thirteen," [...] the Grounders {{celebrate}} their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia {{and a man}} named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, {{she may not be}} able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else. Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E
2500|$|Described by Gomez as [...] "a {{beautiful}} {{start to}} the album", [...] "Good for You" [...] was the third song she received since signing with her new label Interscope Records, as well the second track to be recorded for the album. It was uninterruptedly recorded in 45 minutes at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California; during the process, Gomez's vocals featured cracks as the song [...] "took on this emotion [...] didn't realize [...] could tap into", and {{at the beginning of}} the session she was exhausted from pressurizing herself for a sound and concept for the album. According to her, this recording had no beat and was [...] "just a skeleton of a song". There was also no specific sound planned for the song at the time although it was suggested that its soft melodies be made more pop-indebted which Gomez disagreed with, believing it would take away from her vocal. She was entirely involved in the song's creative direction, providing additional songwriting, and helped to develop it to represent her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and feelings of vulnerability. The song also formed part of a process in which she wanted to portray her story as an artist and as part of a transitional album over which she would take full control. In an interview for MTV, she said this was her time [...] "to embrace who I am, and I'm not going to sit down in a chair and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> that doesn't mean anything to me anymore" [...] and spoke about her involvement in the track: [...] "This is the most I've been creatively involved from the writing process ... every single thing I'm even remotely singing about is something I've related to and something I'm hitting the nail on, and I had to pick what was going to represent the album and who I am as a whole".|$|E
