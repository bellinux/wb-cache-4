5|$|Bank1 captures {{an image}} of the front and back of the {{original}} check and the MICR line data from the front of <b>the</b> <b>check.</b> Bank1 then removes or truncates the original check from the clearing process and uses <b>the</b> <b>check</b> image, MICR data, its own electronic endorsement, and the electronic endorsements to create a substitute check.|$|E
5|$|Image {{statements}} {{that include a}} series of pictures or images of original paper checks and/or substitute checks, photocopies of the original checks, and images of checks posted online are not recognized as the legal equivalents of substitute checks. Unlike a substitute check, a photocopy of a check cannot be presented through <b>the</b> <b>check</b> clearing process for settlement because the photocopy of <b>the</b> <b>check</b> does not adhere strictly to the requirements for substitute checks under the Check21 Act.|$|E

5|$|Back at {{the bowling}} alley, Homer {{and his friends}} enter the bowling league competition, calling {{themselves}} the Pin Pals.

Burns wants to join the team (replacing Otto in the team), but since Burns is a horrible bowler, the team is convinced they will lose the championship.|$|E
5|$|Bank1 {{electronically}} transmits <b>the</b> <b>check</b> {{image and}} the MICR line data captured from the original check to the paying bank (Bank2) for settlement.

25|$|The {{banks that}} had {{originated}} <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> were keen {{to ensure the}} depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> had been received and endorsed by <b>the</b> <b>check's</b> payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account.

5|$|On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{his convictions}} because venue and vicinage {{could not be}} proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent <b>the</b> <b>check</b> to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, {{on the ground that}} the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|The {{game against}} the Islanders also {{featured}} a devastating open-ice hit by Dion Phaneuf on New York's Kyle Okposo that saw the young forward taken off on a stretcher and sent to hospital with a concussion.

In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.|$|E
5|$|In most {{variations}} Black has {{the opportunity}} to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks <b>the</b> <b>check</b> with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do <b>the</b> <b>check,</b> suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>check</b> on Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's {{physician and}} chairman of the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence began when <b>the</b> <b>check</b> pilot, while the aircraft {{was on the}} ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, <b>the</b> <b>check</b> ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When <b>the</b> <b>check</b> came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when <b>the</b> <b>check</b> arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
30|$|In this implementation, {{only one}} thread block is {{allocated}} in the discarding of interior points using the proposed method SPA {{due to the}} data dependency issue in <b>the</b> discarding. When <b>checking</b> whether a point in a specific region such as the region R_ 1, the y coordinate of <b>the</b> point being <b>checked</b> is {{compared to that of}} the current last point of the formed chain; see Fig.  2 a. This means <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> for a point, e.g., P_i, depends on <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> of <b>the</b> previous point P_i- 1. It also means <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> for a set of consecutive points can only be performed in a sequential pattern. However, it is able to first divide a large set of consecutive points into some smaller subsets of consecutive points, and then perform <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> in parallel for each subset of points separately. This solution is in the divide-and-conquer fashion, which is also adopted in the proposed algorithm. However, it is not able to determine the optimal size of a subset of points or the number of all subsets. Thus, it is decided to divide a large set of consecutive points into BLOCK_SIZE subsets, while each subset contains (m + BLOCK_SIZE - 1)/BLOCK_SIZE points; and then, <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> for all <b>the</b> BLOCK_SIZE subsets is carried out in parallel.|$|R
