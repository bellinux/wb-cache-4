2500|$|In {{celestial}} mechanics, the Lagrangian points ( [...] ; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are {{positions in}} an orbital configuration of <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies {{where a small}} object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. <b>The</b> Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. <b>The</b> first three {{are on the line}} connecting <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies; <b>the</b> last <b>two,</b> L4 and L5, each form an equilateral triangle with <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies.|$|R

25|$|In astronomy, Lagrangian {{points are}} five {{positions}} in the orbital plane of <b>two</b> <b>large</b> orbiting bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. <b>The</b> first three Lagrangian points (L1, L2, L3) lie along the line connecting <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies, while <b>the</b> last <b>two</b> points (L4 and L5) each form an equilateral triangle with <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. <b>The</b> L4 and L5 points, although they correspond to maxima of the effective potential in the coordinate frame that rotates with <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies, are stable due to the Coriolis effect. The stability can result in orbits around just L4 or L5, known as Tadpole orbits, where trojans can be found. It can also result in orbits that encircle L3, L4, and L5, known as horseshoe orbits.|$|R

5|$|During colonial times, {{prior to}} the {{establishment}} of the ACT, the European communities of Ginninderra, Molonglo and Tuggeranong settled in and farmed the surrounding land, raising sheep in the main but also breeding horses and growing grain.

The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities. In 1882, the first allotments in the village of Hall – named after early pastoralist Henry Hall – were sold.

5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose {{barycenter}} with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>largest</b> planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E

Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>largest</b> film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films.
