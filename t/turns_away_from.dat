5|$|Dawlish Warren is a sand spit {{and nature}} reserve that {{lies at the}} mouth of the River Exe. The route now <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the coast and follows the Exe estuary past Cockwood to Starcross where the {{seasonal}} Exmouth to Starcross Ferry crosses to Exmouth. The Exe Valley Way continues beyond Starcross towards Exeter, but when the ferry is not running it is possible to catch a train from either Dawlish Warren or Starcross railway stations to Exmouth railway station.|$|E
5|$|Past this intersection, County Route 507 <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Route 7, {{becoming}} concurrent with Route 17. by {{heading north}} on River Road, while Route 7 continues along Bellevill Turnpike for another half mile, Route 7 continues another half mile west, crossing the Passaic River on a lift bridge, {{known as the}} Belleville Turnpike Bridge or Rutgers Street Bridge, into Belleville, Essex County, where the local street name changes from Belleville Turnpike to Rutgers Street. The first section of Route 7 ends at an intersection with Main Street underneath Route 21.|$|E

5|$|Then, SR 78 intersects with SR 115 east of Brawley, running {{concurrently}} {{with it for}} a brief distance. Shortly {{after passing}} through the small community of Glamis, the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve. As it nears the Colorado River and the Arizona border, SR78 briefly passes through Cibola National Wildlife Refuge before entering the community of Palo Verde, where the river <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the highway and SR78 enters Riverside County.|$|E
5|$|Although US-89 {{follows the}} I-70 freeway from Sevier to Salina, the old {{alignment}} {{can still be}} driven, and is state-maintained north of Elsinore as SR-258, SR-118 (which overlaps I-70 Business through Richfield), SR-24, and US-50. Both highways stay mainly in the west half of the Sevier River's valley, with the faster I-70/US-89 bypassing the communities that the surface road passes through. Just south of Salina, I-70 curves to the east, rising alongside Salina Creek, and US-89 exits into downtown Salina, where it rejoins its pre-freeway alignment. US-50 overlaps US-89 between I-70 and Salina, following I-70 east and a separate alignment northwest from the area; the short Interstate 70 Business also uses this roadway as a business spur from I-70 to the city. North of Salina, US-89 bypasses Redmond (SR-256 follows the former route through the town) and passes through Centerfield to Gunnison, where it meets SR-28 and finally <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Sevier River.|$|E
5|$|PA106 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US11 {{in the community}} of Kingsley, Pennsylvania. The route heads to the southeast, paralleling US11 through forestry until the intersection with Jeffers Road, where it <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> US11 and enters fields. The route makes several curves to the southeast and east, crossing through several large fields and industries. The route keeps turning to the southeast, re-entering the deep woods and passing a large pond near West Lenox. In West Lenox, PA106 passes through forestry and residences until leaving the community for more forestry. After paralleling Creek Road for a distance, PA106 enters the small community of Lenox, where the highway intersects PA92 near some industry. A short distance later, the highway interchanges with I-81 at Interchange211. After I-81, PA106 continues paralleling the interstate through forestry. The highway continues eastward, paralleling Stone Road into East Lenox, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Ranch Road 1 {{begins at}} US 290 {{on the west}} side of Stonewall, as a two-lane, paved road. The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town's east side. The route {{continues}} along the river briefly passing through a narrow southwestern portion of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, before entering Lyndon B Johnson State Park and Historic Site. The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along the riverbank and exits the park before intersecting PR 49, which crosses the river accessing the national historic site. After crossing into Blanco County, the route <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the riverbank to the southeast returning to US 290 west of Hye. Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country, the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{into the}} wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop {{down onto the}} sands at low tide, the path follows {{the line of the}} sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for {{explosives}} manufacture for many years, the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to {{the west side of the}} tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.|$|E

25|$|West of Redford, FM 170 intersects Casa Piedra Road, an unpaved county {{route that}} {{provides}} access to the headquarters of Big Bend Ranch State Park and Marfa by way of RM 169. From this point forward to Lajitas, much of the road passes through Big Bend Ranch State Park where the road becomes more mountainous with sharp curves and steep grades. Within the park, there are several campgrounds, picnic areas, trail heads, and an old movie set. The road briefly <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the river at Colorado Canyon.|$|E
25|$|Salvation is {{available}} through Jesus' work on the cross and is a gift from God made possible by grace through faith and not by human works. The PCG believes {{it is possible to}} lose one's salvation if one <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> God. After salvation, a Christian can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The evidence of this baptism is speaking in other tongues. It believes in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite and progressive work of grace. It believes heaven and hell are real places. Heaven is for those who have received the gift of salvation, and hell is for those who have not.|$|E

25|$|Just {{north of}} Rutherford Road, NY310 <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Grasse River, {{proceeding}} northeast towards Trout Brook. At the junction with Planty Road, NY310 and Trout Brook begin running alongside each other, entering a large junction with CR38 (MadridNorfolk Road) and CR44 (NorfolkChamberlain Corners Road). NY310 continues northeast from this junction without the moniker, crossing from Madrid {{into the town}} of Norfolk. After a couple of miles, the route crosses a junction with Stark Road and enters the hamlet of Raymondville. In Raymondville, NY310 becomes a two-lane residential road as it approaches the Raquette River. Running northeast, NY310 enters a junction with CR39 and NY56, a large junction marking the northern terminus of NY310.|$|E
25|$|Entering Brooklyn via the Cranberry Street Tunnel as a two-track line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line travels east on Cranberry Street, then {{south on}} Jay Street. It becomes the Fulton Street Line at an {{interlocking}} north of Jay Street–MetroTech while briefly running {{parallel with the}} IND Culver Line. It <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Culver Line onto Schermerhorn Street to the six-track Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station, which it shares with the Brooklyn–Queens Crosstown Line. The local tracks are unused at Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets, but connect to the abandoned Court Street station which is now {{the site of the}} New York City Transit Museum. At this point, the line becomes a four-track system until Euclid Avenue.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with the means of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool as the object <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application of the paint itself; {{a process in which}} his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.|$|E

25|$|In the journey, it is {{revealed}} that Elika had died {{prior to the}} beginning of the game. Her father took her to Ahriman and asked him to revive her selling his soul in the process to Ahriman, thus making him one of the corrupted. Once Elika is revived she discovers she has new-found powers. After gaining even more powers, the two encounter Elika's father once again. After healing all the Fertile Grounds, as well as defeating all bosses, Elika and the Prince return to the temple to imprison Ahriman. Once inside, however, they are confronted by the king who is now a fully corrupted being. They defeat him, he calls his daughter's name, <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them and throws himself off the platform they are on. Ahriman rises from the corruption below. They battle him, but Elika must give up her very life to finish the spell which seals Ahriman away. She finishes the spell and dies.|$|E
25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} rocket, the {{collapse}} of the gravity field causes Toby to reveal the mind of the Beast is still possessing him as he taunts the others while breathing out fire. Rose takes Captain Zach's bolt gun and shoots out the rocket's front window, unhooking Toby's safety harness to jettison the possessed man into space towards the black hole. The cabin is sealed by automatic shields but the rocket still lacks the power to escape the gravity well. Suddenly their ride smooths out and the rocket <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the black hole. The Doctor contacts Captain Zach, telling him that he is towing the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. The Doctor asks for Rose and jokingly offers to trade Zach back Ida, whom he rescued from the planet caverns, for Rose. The Doctor reports he did not have time to go back and save the Ood, who were innocent victims of the Beast's possession. Once safe, the respective crews depart on their separate ways. As they return to Earth, Captain Zach reads off the list of personnel that died, including the Ood.|$|E
