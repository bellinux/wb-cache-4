5|$|Once Cloudsgate Citadel {{is back to}} normal, {{the party}} speaks to King Zenith who informs them of Mortamor's doings and how to reach <b>the</b> <b>Dread</b> Realm. Mortamor plans on merging both worlds. The party’s horse fuses with Pegasus, {{allowing}} the party to fly to <b>the</b> <b>Dread</b> Realm. Several challenges await in <b>the</b> <b>Dread</b> Realm, with one such challenge being the party's strength suddenly and unexpectedly plummeting. With the help of two Supreme Sage brothers, Benjamin and Isaac, the party enters Mortamor's Castle. After solving many puzzles, they {{come face to face}} with Mortamor and defeat him. Isaac reveals that <b>the</b> <b>Dread</b> Realm is falling apart and Pegasus helps them escape. After returning to the Real World, everyone parts ways, with Ashlynn having to return to the Dream World since her Real World self doesn't exist anymore. With Mortamor's link between the Real World and the Dream World severed, the Dream World vanishes, with only Cloudgate Castle being the remaining visible portion in the Real World. It's then shown that Ashlynn is in the castle, taking care of the newly hatched Zenithian Dragon.|$|E

However, if the crochet hook method is applied by a skilled hand throughout the length of <b>the</b> <b>dread,</b> then the resulting dreadlocks are instantly tight and will not need any rolling.|$|E

25|$|Against this {{background}} of dread, {{there was an}} outpouring of cinema with frightening themes, particularly in the science fiction genre. Science fiction had previously not been popular with either critics or movie audiences, but it became a viable Hollywood genre during the Cold War. In the 1950s, science fiction had two main themes: {{the invasion of the}} Earth by superior, aggressive, and frequently technologically advanced aliens; and <b>the</b> <b>dread</b> of atomic weapons, which was typically portrayed as a revolt of nature, with irradiated monsters attacking and ravaging entire cities.|$|E
25|$|Georgiana {{moved on}} her {{marriage}} into rented rooms in Great Russell Street.

Their first child, Philip, was born on 21 October 1861. But {{in the summer of}} 1864 little Phil caught scarlet fever, and Georgiana soon contracted <b>the</b> <b>dread</b> disease, which brought on the premature birth of her second child, Christopher, who was also infected and died soon after. Georgiana was ill for months, and on her recovery refused to return to their old rooms where so much tragedy had occurred.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, India {{signed the}} Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), stating {{that it did}} not have {{chemical}} weapons and the capacity or intent to manufacture chemical weapons. By doing this India became one of the original signatories of the CWC in 1993, and ratified it on 2 September 1996. According to India's ex-Army Chief General Sunderji, a country having the capability of making nuclear weapons does not need to have chemical weapons, since <b>the</b> <b>dread</b> of chemical weapons could be created only in those countries that do not have nuclear weapons. Others suggested that the fact that India has found chemical weapons dispensable highlighted its confidence in the conventional weapons system at its command.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{disagree}} whether Mercia was {{an independent}} kingdom under Æthelred and Ætheflæd but {{they agree that}} Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played {{an important part in}} the conquest of the Danelaw.

According to Pauline Stafford, [...] "like... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages". In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.|$|E

Against, as it were, the ferocious legions of the barbarians, which in their troops never cease to batter the tortoise of the soldiers of Christ with the artillery of guileful fraud, the struggle must go on manfully, fought with the darts of spiritual weaponry and the iron-tipped spears of the virtues.

500|$|Alcatraz {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most [...] "haunted" [...] places in America. The Native Americans {{mentioned}} the evil spirits they purportedly encountered on the island long before it became a military prison. Mark Twain visited it, found the atmosphere of the island eerie, and described it as [...] "being as cold as winter, even in the summer months", and The Washington Post has also claimed that Alcatraz is a place [...] "where visitors can sense <b>the</b> <b>dread</b> of past inhabitants still trapped in the atmosphere." [...] The alleged haunting of the prison has been documented in numerous paranormal television series. Officials for Alcatraz have dismissed the reports of ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, [...] "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting. And how can these people say they heard canaries? We don't have any birds in here." ...|$|E

[...] The [...] "grunge credo was more about a death by slow suffocation", a [...] "resistance through withdrawal" [...] from the world. Rupa Huq calls grunge [...] "unrelentingly white" [...] in [...] "timbre and texture". Robert Loss states that while the grunge scene was more welcoming to women than the glam metal world, and while grunge [...] "...endeavoured to be more accepting of ethnic and cultural difference, it was overwhelmingly white"; he states that hip hop music artists such as Jay-Z had way more [...] "crossover" [...] appeal to listeners of different races.|$|E

500|$|To the West Saxon {{version of}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Æthelflæd was merely King Edward's sister, whereas for the Mercian Register she was Lady of the Mercians. Irish and Welsh annals {{described}} her as a queen and the Annals of Ulster, which ignore the deaths of Alfred and Edward, described her as famosissima regina Saxonum (renowned Saxon queen). She was also praised by Anglo-Norman historians such as John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury, who described her as [...] "a powerful accession to [...] party, the delight of his subjects, <b>the</b> <b>dread</b> of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul". He claimed that she declined to have sex {{after the birth of}} her only child because it was [...] "unbecoming of the daughter of a king to give way to a delight which, after a time, produced such painful consequences". According to Nick Higham, [...] "successive medieval and modern writers were quite captivated by her" [...] and her brother's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.

500|$|Chris at Square Enix Music Online {{disliked the}} game's music: {{he called it}} {{the worst in the}} whole series, and said that the music pieces tend to be {{monotone}} and based on repetition of nothingness. He said that slowly building ambient pieces such as [...] "Title Demo", [...] "Title", and [...] "Memory Recovery" [...] are effective in context, but that they are too simple and repetitive to be enjoyable as stand-alone music. He did however find the pieces [...] "Disco" [...] and [...] "Casino" [...] both humorous and catchy. Kyle Miller and Damian Thomas, both writing for RPGFan, were more positive to the music. Miller found the soundtrack well made, but worse than that of the first Shin Megami Tensei. The pieces he liked the most were [...] "Heretic Mansion" [...] and some battle themes. He also liked [...] "Casino", which he found catchy and thought worked as an effective contrast to <b>the</b> <b>dread</b> of the other pieces. Thomas found the soundtrack to be excellent, and said that while several pieces are short, they have solid melodies. Kalata and Snelgrove appreciated the music that is played during battles. Famitsu thought the PlayStation version's graphics looked [...] "cheap".|$|E

Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist, {{although he did not}} want to emulate the stereotypical [...] "mustache-twirling pervert". The director considered Van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor—one who was a [...] "full-fledged human being" [...] and a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. [...] "He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside," [...] Fincher stated. Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, [...] "This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go through all that. I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and <b>the</b> <b>dread</b> of this character, but I was able to use both of those things. We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable. The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding the humanity of him." ...|$|E
