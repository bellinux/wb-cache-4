50|$|Many {{variations}} of the Prins reaction exist because it lends itself easily to cyclization reactions {{and because it is}} possible to capture the oxo-carbenium ion with a large array of nucleophiles. The halo-Prins reaction is one such modification with replacement of protic acids and water by lewis acids such as stannic chloride and boron tribromide. The halogen is now the nucleophile recombining with the carbocation. The cyclization of certain allyl pulegones in scheme 7 with titanium tetrachloride in dichloromethane at −78 °C gives access to the decalin skeleton with the hydroxyl group and chlorine group predominantly in cis configuration (91% cis). This observed cis diastereoselectivity is due to the intermediate formation of a trichlorotitanium alkoxide making possible an easy delivery of chlorine to the carbocation ion from the same face. The trans isomer is preferred (98% cis) when the switch is made to a <b>tin</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> reaction at room temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the sample introduction system on the signals obtained with different tin compounds in inductively coupled plasma (ICP) based techniques, i. e., ICP atomic emission spectrometry (ICP–AES) and ICP mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) has been studied. Signals for test solutions prepared from four different tin compounds (i. e., <b>tin</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> monobutyltin, dibutyltin and di-tert-butyltin) in different solvents (methanol 0. 8 % (w/w), i-propanol 0. 8 % (w/w) and various acid matrices) have been measured by ICP–AES and ICP–MS. The results demonstrate a noticeable {{influence of}} the volatility of the tin compounds on their signals measured with both techniques. Thus, {{in agreement with the}} compound volatility, the highest signals are obtained for <b>tin</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> followed by di-tert-butyltin/monobutyltin and dibutyltin. The sample introduction system exerts an important effect on the amount of solution loading the plasma and, hence, on the relative signals afforded by the tin compounds in ICP–based techniques. Thus, when working with a pneumatic concentric nebulizer, the use of spray chambers affording high solvent transport efficiency to the plasma (such as cyclonic and single pass) or high spray chamber temperatures is recommended to minimize the {{influence of the}} tin chemical compound. Nevertheless, even when using the conventional pneumatic nebulizer coupled to the best spray chamber design (i. e., a single pass spray chamber), signals obtained for di-tert-butyltin/monobutyltin and dibutyltin are still around 10 % and 30 % lower than the corresponding signal for <b>tin</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> respectively. When operating with a pneumatic microconcentric nebulizer coupled to a 50 °C-thermostated cinnabar spray chamber, all studied organotin compounds provided similar emission signals although about 60 % lower than those obtained for <b>tin</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b> The use of an ultrasonic nebulizer coupled to a desolvation device provides the largest differences in the emission signals, among all tested systems...|$|E
