5|$|Georgina Haig as Henrietta (Etta) Bishop (seasons 4–5): Peter and Olivia's adult {{daughter}} in 2036. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} Fringe team, loyal to the Observers, she secretly works with the human resistance to try to reclaim the earth for humans.|$|E
5|$|Mary, however, is {{depicted}} as authentic rather than artificial, detesting fashionable life rather than yearning after it. Mary's charitable works, for example, are not a passing fad: they are a heartfelt reaction to social injustice. Even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> older and intellectual instead of young and pretty, Mary asserts her right to sexual desire rather than sublimating it.|$|E
5|$|Among the world's {{remaining}} battleships, Texas {{is notable}} {{for being the}} only remaining World War I–era dreadnought battleship, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not the oldest surviving battleship: , a pre-dreadnought battleship ordered in 1898 by the Imperial Japanese Navy and HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar, are both older than Texas. She is also noteworthy for being one of only seven remaining ships and the only remaining capital ship to have served in both World Wars.|$|E
60|$|Then Dorcas fired up, meek-natured <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and {{accustomed}} <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to obey her husband's will.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had to <b>be</b> in the picture, and so {{she came}} in as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> the central figure, as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> the quintessential England. There <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> the type, the blood, the likeness, of no end of Massachusetts families, the very same stuff indeed, and yet <b>she</b> <b>was</b> different....|$|R
60|$|The Princess {{stared at}} the child as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a lunatic.|$|R
5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{well aware of}} them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|Forrest's widow, Christine (Katharine Hepburn), {{refuses to}} speak to reporters {{throughout}} the proceedings. However, O'Malley befriends youngster Jeb (Darryl Hickman), son of the gatekeeper of the Forrest estate, Jason Rickards (Howard Da Silva). The grief-stricken boy shows him a way into the mansion, where he meets Christine. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> cordial enough, she refuses any cooperation with his biography. After O'Malley leaves, Forrest's private secretary, Clive Kerndon (Richard Whorf), fearful of how the reporter will react to the brushoff, convinces Christine to offer her help {{so that they can}} steer him in the direction they want.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to acting in films, Mukerji {{is involved with}} several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show Dance Premier League. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> reticent to discuss her personal life in public, her off-screen life {{is the subject of}} substantial media coverage in India. She is married to filmmaker Aditya Chopra, with whom she has a daughter.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is unclear}} when or by whom Hayes {{was called the}} [...] "First Lady of the Theatre". Her friend, actress Katharine Cornell, also held that title, and each thought the other {{deserved}} it. One critic said that Cornell played every queen as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a woman, whereas Hayes played every woman as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a queen.|$|R
60|$|Then {{first she}} laughed, and next looked as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> going to cry.|$|R

5|$|Marina Litvinenko : UK reports state Litvinenko's widow tested {{positive}} for polonium, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not seriously ill. The Ashdown Park hotel in Sussex has been evacuated as a precaution, possibly to do with Scaramella's previous visit there. According to the 6pm Channel 4 (9 December 2006) news the intake of polonium she suffered would only result in a dose of 100 mSv, leading to a 1 in 200 chance of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Realizing how {{important}} Toby is to her, Sarah gives him Lancelot {{and returns to}} her room. After she hears her father and stepmother come in, she sees her friends {{in the mirror and}} realizes even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> growing up, she still needs them in her life every now and again. In an instant, a number of the major characters from the Labyrinth appear in her room for a raucous celebration, and she reunites with Hoggle, Ludo, Didymus, and Ambrosius. As they celebrate, Jareth, in his owl form, watches from outside and then flies away into the night.|$|E
5|$|The series {{begins by}} mostly {{introducing}} the office's workers via a tour given by branch manager Michael Scott {{for both the}} camera crew and a first-day temp (Ryan Howard). The audience learns salesman Jim Halpert has a crush on receptionist Pam Beesly (who helps him play pranks on co-worker Dwight Schrute), even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> engaged to Roy (who works in the building's lower-level warehouse). News spreads throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety, but Michael chooses to deny or downplay {{the realities of the}} situation in order to maintain employee morale.|$|E
60|$|Lady Scatcherd's cheeks became rather red, as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{somewhat}} {{ashamed of}} her position.|$|R

5|$|Chamunda is {{included}} in the Saptamatrika (seven Matrikas or mothers) lists in the Hindu texts like Mahabharata (Chapter 'Vana-parva'), Devi Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana. She is often depicted in the Saptamatrika group in sculptures, examples of which are Ellora and Elephanta caves. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> always portrayed last (rightmost) in the group, she is sometimes referred to {{as the leader of the}} group. While other Matrikas are considered as Shaktis (powers) of male divinities and resemble them in their appearance, Chamunda is the only Matrika who is a Shakti of the great Goddess Devi rather than a male god. She is also the only Matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own; all other Matrikas are always worshipped together.|$|E
5|$|Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is a shy girl {{living in}} the Dutch Republic in 1665. Her father, a Delftware painter, has {{recently}} gone blind, rendering him unable to work and putting his family in a precarious financial situation. To help matters, Griet is sent {{to work as a}} maid in the household of famed painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Griet works hard, almost wordlessly, in the lowest position in a harsh hierarchy, doing her best despite spiteful treatment by one of Vermeer's children. While she is on a routine shopping trip outside the house, a butcher's son, Pieter (Cillian Murphy), notices Griet and falls in love with her, even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> slow to return his affections.|$|E
5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the backside.|$|E

60|$|He stood up, and, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> annoyed, {{the fire}} in his eyes was good to look upon.|$|R
60|$|She {{finished}} a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> going to start.|$|R
5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee {{because of her}} personality, and her relationship with other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew longer as the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's sex appeal by having her skirt shorter even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, {{to the point where}} they would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that she was happy with how Lenalee had matured, and at the same time become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series when they were both the same height.|$|E
5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E
5|$|Knowles rehearsed {{the pole}} dancing using two ballet bars, which {{was when it}} was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> from Texas, she had never {{previously}} been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00am that they completed work.|$|E

5|$|One spring, a {{relative}} of the Mistress brings her invalid toddler, Baby, to the Place {{in the hope that}} the weather will help her grow stronger.

5|$|Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Amidala to Coruscant, so {{that she}} can plead her people's case to Chancellor Valorum and the Galactic Senate. Qui-Gon asks the Jedi Council for {{permission}} to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council refuses after he is interviewed by Yoda and becomes concerned that Anakin is vulnerable to the dark side. Undaunted, Qui-Gon vows to train Anakin himself. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator Palpatine persuades Amidala to make a vote of no confidence in Valorum to elect a more capable chancellor to resolve the crisis on Naboo. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> successful in pushing for the vote, Amidala grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate, and decides to return to Naboo. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are ordered by the Jedi Council to accompany the queen to Naboo, as well as to confirm the return of the Sith, whom they believe to be extinct.|$|E

He aids Max in an assault on the Manticore headquarters, though Max is badly wounded and captured. In season two Cale exposes Manticore to the world, and Renfro torches the facility in an attempt to cover up the evidence, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> killed in the process. Max escapes the facility and frees hundreds of other super soldiers and failed Manticore experiments. Lydecker disappears under mysterious circumstances. National Security Agency agent Ames White, who {{is also a member of}} a secretive cult that wishes to eliminate transgenics, is tasked with recapturing the Manticore escapees. Both the authorities and cult members pursue Max, though she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City, Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The second and final season ends with the military surrounding and possibly preparing to invade Terminal City.|$|E
