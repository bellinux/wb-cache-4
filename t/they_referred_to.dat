5|$|After the {{conviction}} for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five-year-old Lisa Sheridan, who died without medical care in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the church lobbied the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) {{to add a}} religious exemption to the Code of Federal Regulations. Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent. States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; {{the wording of the}} exemptions made clear that <b>they</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> Christian Science.|$|E
5|$|Frank Case, {{owner of}} the hotel, ensured a daily luncheon for the talented group of young writers by {{treating}} them to free celery and popovers; more importantly, they were provided with their own table and waiter. Edna Ferber, Franklin P. Adams, George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Marc Connelly eventually joined the group, expanding its membership. All members were affiliated with the Algonquin Round Table, although <b>they</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> themselves as the Vicious Circle.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chocolate}} beverage {{is believed}} to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa beverage was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which <b>they</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as xocōlātl. The beverage became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} of sociobiology to humans (discussed {{only in the}} first and last chapters of the book) was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that sociobiology embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. <b>They</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> social Darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. They believed that Wilson was committing the naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's sociobiology, including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} are {{estimated}} to have arrived in Virginia over 12,000years ago. By 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 AD. By 1500, the Algonquian peoples had founded towns such as Werowocomoco in the Tidewater region, which <b>they</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as Tsenacommacah. The other major language groups in the area were the Siouan to the west, and the Iroquoians, who included the Nottoway and Meherrin, {{to the north and}} south. After 1570, the Algonquians consolidated under Chief Powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network. Powhatan controlled more than 30smaller tribes and over 150settlements, who shared a common Virginia Algonquian language. In 1607, the native Tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{transferred}} by Vincent Hustad and colleagues {{to the newly}} created genus Glutinoglossum in 2013 when molecular analysis revealed that it and the species G.heptaseptatum formed a well-defined clade in the Geoglossaceae. In 2015, Hustad and Andrew Miller published an emended description of G.glutinosum with a narrower range of spore dimensions, suggesting that material collected in Australia and New Zealand represent unique species, which <b>they</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> G.australasicum and G.exiguum. These species, along with G.americanum and G.methvenii, were added to Glutinoglossum in 2015. Hustad and Miller noted their new spore size range for G.glutinosum were more closely aligned with those given by Durand in his measurements of Persoon's type specimen.|$|E

25|$|Carey {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) and bar for his actions In France. The awards were made {{simultaneously}} and appeared in the London Gazette on 31 May 1940. Following a week of leave, he re-joined 43 Squadron at Tangmere on 24 June 1940. The squadron was now about {{to participate in the}} Battle of Britain. The Luftwaffe began an air campaign to gain air superiority as a prelude to an amphibious invasion, Operation Seelöwe. The Germans began a series of anti-shipping operations which <b>they</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as the Kanalkampf.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} {{handed over to}} Siby Mathews, who would later {{become one of the}} most {{accomplished}} police officers in Kerala service.

This led the trail to Chennai (then known as Madras), and to Reni George, a close relative of the murdered couple.

25|$|Another {{effort was}} made in 1843.

It was expected to be completed in five years, but the plan was never carried out. At nearly the same time, other ideas were floated, including a canal (and/or a railroad) across Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Nothing came of that plan either.|$|E
