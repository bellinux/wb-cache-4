5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>rink</b> was budgeted for $5 million, it was {{constructed}} for only $3.2 million ($ million today), {{making it one}} of the few Millennium Park attractions to cost less than was initially budgeted. <b>The</b> <b>rink</b> was funded by and named for the McCormick Tribune Foundation, which was established by former Chicago Tribune owner and publisher Robert R. McCormick. The McCormick Tribune Foundation is a supporter of the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum and the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, both of which are also located in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the Victoria Skating Club sold <b>the</b> <b>rink,</b> {{dissolving}} the Club. Ice skating continued {{under the}} new ownership, and on December 19, 1908, the Earl Grey Skating Club was founded at the Victoria Rink. In a ceremony at <b>the</b> <b>rink,</b> the club's patron, Governor-General Albert Grey formally initiated the club. Club honorary president Sir H. Montagu Allan and Lady Evelyn Grey {{were the first to}} appear on the ice. Mrs. Helen Joseph became the president of the Club. The Earl Grey Club would move to the Montreal Arena by 1911.|$|E

50|$|The site usually {{offers several}} hockey rinks of varying sizes {{as well as}} a {{recreational}} skating loop. Facilities at <b>the</b> <b>rinks</b> include washrooms, benches for seating, and miscellaneous hockey equipment for hockey players to use. As <b>the</b> <b>rinks</b> are not maintained by local authorities, facilities are made available through funds raised by local organisations such as the Palgrave Rotary Club and through donations by families using <b>the</b> <b>rinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The club {{took their}} various names from <b>the</b> <b>rinks</b> they played in. The Crystal Palace Skating <b>Rink</b> from 1885-1889. <b>The</b> Dominion <b>Rink</b> in 1890, and <b>the</b> Crescent Skating <b>Rink</b> in 1891. When the team moved to <b>the</b> Victoria Skating <b>Rink</b> in 1893, they reverted to their {{original}} name of Montreal Crystals, since they couldn't use the Victoria's name because of the Montreal Victorias.|$|R

5|$|Smaller hockey leagues {{continued}} to use <b>the</b> <b>Rink,</b> such as the Commercial and Steamship League, the Inter-School Hockey League and the Manufacturers' League. McGill University also occasionally used <b>the</b> <b>rink.</b> The final game of any note reported by the Montreal Gazette was a semi-final of the Canadian National Railway Hockey League (CNR) between Car Department and General Office on March 3, 1925, exactly fifty {{years after the first}} game. The playoff final game of the CNR league was not held at the Victoria; it was held at the Forum which had opened that season. The CNR game drew 1,200 spectators.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rink</b> hosted many musical performances. In 1878, {{a benefit}} concert {{was held to}} aid yellow fever victims in the {{southern}} states of the United States, featuring soprano Leonora Braham. In 1890, an audience of 6,000 attended a benefit for Montreal's Notre-Dame Hospital featuring a performance by soprano Emma Albani, as well as pianist and composer Salomon Mazurette, violinist Alfred De Sève, and the Montreal City Band {{under the direction of}} Ernest Lavigne. <b>The</b> <b>rink</b> is also known to have held performances of the Montreal Philharmonic Society, which existed from 1875 to 1899.|$|E

5|$|The Victoria Skating Club was {{incorporated}} on June 9, 1862, with a sizable capitalization of $12,000, {{for the purpose}} of buying the land and building <b>the</b> <b>rink.</b> The directors included members of prominent families of the Square Mile: John Greenshields, whose family owned the largest drygoods wholesale firm in Canada and James Torrance, whose family owned a prosperous provisions wholesale firm. <b>The</b> <b>Rink,</b> one of the first and largest indoor rinks in North America, was completed and opened on December 24, 1862. However, it was not the first indoor rink in Montreal. The first had opened in 1859, {{at the north end of}} St. Urbain Street, for the Montreal Skating Club. It was the first of numerous ice rinks in Canada to be named after Queen Victoria. By about 1880, membership in the Victoria Skating Club had reached 2,000, mostly drawn from Montreal's upper classes, who enjoyed considerable leisure time and could afford to participate in such events as the fancy-dress balls, which were a regular feature at <b>the</b> <b>rink.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} {{differences}} from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, <b>the</b> <b>rink</b> (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the rover. Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months, dog shows, {{vaudeville}} performances, the horticultural show and various trade exhibitions continued at <b>the</b> <b>Rink.</b> By the 1920s, {{the building had}} deteriorated and the gallery became unsafe to use. Shaw sold the site in 1925 for $250,000 to the Stanley Realty Corporation to build a parking garage. The Victoria closed and a parking garage was built in its place.|$|E

In 56 games, he scored seven goals and 23 points. Adding four assists in seven 2004 playoff games, the Canucks were defeated in the first round by the Calgary Flames.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> ice <b>rinks</b> on <b>the</b> Mill Pond {{are created}} in late fall or early winter - {{as soon as}} the pond freezes deeply enough to support human traffic - and are {{maintained}} throughout the winter and into the early spring, {{for as long as the}} ice retains a safe thickness. <b>The</b> <b>rinks</b> are seldom left unused and on the weekends the mill pond is transformed into a postcard image of Canada when <b>the</b> <b>rinks</b> fill with families out to enjoy a leisurely skate or game of pond hockey.|$|R

[...] Hunt began clearing <b>the</b> <b>rinks</b> with his teenage children after searching unsuccessfully for another local public rink where they could skate and play hockey. Local residents soon noticed <b>the</b> new ice <b>rink</b> and flocked out to make use of it. Hunt then began expanding the skating area of <b>the</b> central hockey <b>rink</b> and built a loop around it where recreational skaters could skate without hockey players and skaters {{getting in the way of}} one another.|$|R
5|$|Selänne {{made his}} final post-season {{appearance}} during the 2014 playoffs.

He played his final game on May 16, 2014, as the Ducks were eliminated by Los Angeles. Following the contest, Selänne was saluted by fans, teammates and opponents alike, and took a final lap around <b>the</b> <b>rink.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rink</b> {{was also}} notable for {{its role in}} the {{development}} of figure skating in Canada. It held some of the first competitions in the sport in Canada. During its existence, it was the home of two important clubs, the Victoria Skating Club and the Earl Grey Skating Club. It was the home rink of Louis Rubenstein, considered one of the first world champions of the sport, and also an important organizer.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around <b>the</b> <b>rink.</b> However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around <b>the</b> <b>rink.</b> According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E
