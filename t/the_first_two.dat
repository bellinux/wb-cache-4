5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure {{was created by}} a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
