5|$|For the 1967 NFL season, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> {{expanded}} to 16 teams, and split its two conferences into two divisions each, with four teams in each division. The four division champions would advance to <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> playoffs, and {{to remain on}} schedule, a tie-breaker system was introduced. The first round of playoffs determined the conference's champion and its representative in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Championship Game, played the following week. Thus, 1967 was the first season there was a scheduled playoff tournament to determine the teams to play for <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Championship.|$|E

5|$|Several {{professional}} football leagues {{have been formed}} as rival leagues to <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> The most successful rival league was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969. The AFL became a significant rival in 1964 before signing a five-year, US$36million television deal with NBC. AFL teams began to sign NFL players to contracts, and the league's popularity grew to challenge that of <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> The two leagues merged in the 1970 season, and all AFL teams joined <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> An earlier league, the All-America Football Conference, was in play from 1946 to 1949. After the league dissolved, two AAFC teams, the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers, became members of the NFL; another member, the Baltimore Colts joined the league, but folded after just a year in <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1932 NFL season {{resulted}} in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, {{and could not be}} resolved by the typical winloss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won the game and the championship. The following year, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Championship Game. In 1967, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game {{in each of the four}} seasons before the completed merger. <b>The</b> <b>NFL</b> Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> champion.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>NFL's</b> {{war with}} <b>the</b> rival American Football League began to {{increase}} as the two leagues competed for the top players coming out of college.
