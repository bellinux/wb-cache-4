5|$|In {{addition}} to Italian, {{the majority of}} the population speak fluent Ampezzano, a local variant of Ladin, now recognized as a language rather than a dialect. Ladin comes from Latin (like Italian, French and Spanish) and resembles Romansh which is spoken in Switzerland. Maintaining the local language, that is not only spoken by <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> but also by many of Cortina's younger inhabitants, has become a symbol of their attachment to the local mountainous heritage. The community is also proud of its Ladin or Tyrolean culture, that continues to survive despite the increasing pressure it has faced in recent years. Its importance is even beginning to be recognized by the local authorities who in December 2007 decided to use Ladin on signs for the names of streets and villages, in compliance with regulations for the protection of linguistic minorities in force since 1999.|$|E

About 400 men from the colony served in the French military during World War I, 25% of whom died.

25|$|Seniors’ {{subjective}} health remains {{relatively stable}} while objective health worsens with age. Furthermore, {{it seems that}} the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled in the equation. This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process. The elderly may actually enhance their perception of their own health through social comparison; for instance, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> get, the more they may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers. Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health.|$|E

500|$|Quatermass {{met with}} a {{generally}} unenthusiastic critical response. Sean Day-Lewis wrote, [...] "Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass [...] "far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest" [...] while The Times found the serial to be [...] "a so-so affair". More positive was the Daily Mail who thought the serial was [...] "not the best of Nigel Kneale but it equalled any of his earliest Quatermass stories". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be [...] "a bitter reaction {{by a member of}} an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who are impervious to the malign alien influence". This view is echoed by filmmaker John Carpenter who said, [...] "Nigel was very embittered about the way of the world, as was shown, I think, in The Quatermass Conclusion".|$|E

In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E

The stones for the building of 'Arraghslea' came from the ruins of an old castle located at nearby Dromline. The placename of Springhouse or Spring House originated from a spring or well near a whitethorn tree close to the scullery {{at the rear of the}} mansion house and the townland assumed this name thereafter. The McCarthys of Springhouse also have their 'Banshee' (Clíodhna), the story of which is told by Thomas Crofton Croker in his Fairy Tales and Traditions of the South of Ireland published in 1825.
