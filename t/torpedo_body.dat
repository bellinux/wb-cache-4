5|$|Marine mammals have {{a number}} of {{physiological}} and anatomical features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species specific. Marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as <b>torpedo</b> shaped <b>bodies</b> to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchangers); <b>torpedo</b> shaped <b>bodies,</b> reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the First World War, Bertone's {{business}} restarted {{and expanded}} its activities, and began focusing on the automotive sector. In 1920, a new plant was opened near the Monginevro 119 in Turin.Twenty people were on the payroll. One year later, the first important contract was signed to the company. This was a <b>torpedo</b> styled <b>body</b> based on the SPA 23S chassis.

5000|$|In {{the final}} phase of the action against Bismarck, Rodney fired two 24.5 in torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit. According to Ludovic Kennedy, [...] "if true, is the only {{instance}} in history of one battleship torpedoing another". [...] Earlier in this same action the starboard side tube had its sluice door jammed {{as the result of a}} near miss from one of Bismarcks early salvos. On 27 September 1941, Nelsons port torpedo station almost proved to be a liability when an Italian air-launched 18-inch torpedo holed the compartment behind the <b>torpedo</b> <b>body</b> room, allowing 3,750 tons of water to enter the ship. Following this Nelsons torpedo tubes may have been removed although another source suggests the torpedo tubes were retained in both ships into 1945.|$|E
5000|$|The {{test car}} was {{equipped}} with a four-seated <b>torpedo</b> <b>body.</b> The compact (106 inch) wheelbase left ample legroom for driver and passengers, there was space for luggage behind the front {{seat in front of}} the passengers.

50|$|The last {{entry in}} the class is the UGST heavy {{deepwater}} torpedo {{with a range of}} up to 60 km (export versions are limited to 40 km). It differs from the most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or peroxide propulsion, it uses the Otto fuel axial engine, which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots. It also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive wake homing, features a phased array active sonar and an improved wire guidance system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance wire spool in the <b>torpedo</b> <b>body,</b> with the wire released through the hollow propeller shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the wire release port on the side. Together with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before. It was supposed to enter service in the 1990s, but the teething problems and the lack of funding during that period made the deployment sluggish, and it entered the widespread service only in the 2015 by the Fizik name, being quickly replaced by the new-generation Futlyar (Fizik-2). Sources refer to them as heat-seeking torpedoes.|$|E
5000|$|The Pontiac brand was {{introduced}} by General Motors in 1926 as the companion marque to GM's Oakland division, and shared the GM A platform. It was named after the famous Ottawa chief who had also given his name {{to the city of}} Pontiac, Michigan where the car was produced. Within months of its introduction, Pontiac was outselling Oakland, which was essentially a 1920s Chevrolet with a six-cylinder engine installed. Body styles offered included a sedan with both two and four doors, Landau Coupe, with the Sport Phaeton, Sport Landau Sedan, Sport Cabriolet and Sport Roadster. As a result of Pontiac's rising sales, versus Oakland's declining sales, Pontiac became the only companion marque to survive its parent, with Oakland ceasing production in 1932. It was also manufactured from knock-down kits at GM's short-lived Japanese factory at Osaka Assembly in Osaka, Japan from 1927-1941.Pontiac produced cars offering [...] 186.7 CID L (3.25x3.75 in, 82.5x95mm) L-head straight 6-cylinder engines in the Pontiac Chief of 1927; its stroke was the shortest of any American car in the industry at the time. The Chief sold 39,000 units within six months of its appearance at the 1926 New York Auto Salon, hitting 76,742 at twelve months. The next year, it became the top-selling six in the U.S., ranking seventh in overall sales. By 1933, it had moved up to producing the least expensive cars available with straight eight-cylinder (inline eight) engines. This was done by using many components from the 6-cylinder Chevrolet Master, such as the body, but installing a large chrome strip on the top and center of the front hood Pontiac called the [...] "Silver Streak". In the late 1930s, Pontiac used the so-called <b>torpedo</b> <b>body</b> of the Buick for one of its models, just prior to its being used by Chevrolet. This body style brought some attention to the marque. An unusual feature of the [...] "torpedo" [...] body exhibition car, was that with push of a button the front half of the car body would open showing the engine and the car's front seat interior. In 1937, the eight-cylinder had a 122 in wheelbase, while the six-cylinder had a 117 in wheelbase. In 1940, Pontiac introduced a new vehicle called the Pontiac Torpedo, and two years later, on 2 February 1942 a Pontiac was the last civilian automobile manufactured in the United States during World War II, as all automobile factories converted to military production.|$|E
