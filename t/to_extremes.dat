5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) invite the office over to Gabe's house for a Glee viewing party. Michael Scott cannot handle the fact that the office workers think of Gabe as their boss instead of him. Growing more jealous of Gabe and Erin's relationship, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) goes <b>to</b> <b>extremes</b> in order to impress her. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) helps Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with CeCe, much to her husband Jim's chagrin.|$|E
5|$|Tolerant of both {{heat and}} cold, it is grown in North America in United States Department of Agriculture {{hardiness}} zones three through nine, although some cultivars {{may be better}} suited than others <b>to</b> <b>extremes</b> of temperature. It is successfully grown from the southwestern United States, north and east {{across much of the}} country, and across the Canada–US border into Ontario and Quebec. In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the winter. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it hardiness rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters.|$|E

This paper {{analyzes}} the reaction ofstock markets in four industrialized economies (Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the US) to ten major international crises. We employ an event study {{to investigate whether}} the stock exchanges react differently with respect <b>to</b> <b>extreme</b> {{events such as the}} Chernobyl nuclear power plant meltdown, the Gulf War, the peso crisis, the Kosovo War or the 11 / 9 attack on the US. There is no substantial evidence that markets react differently <b>to</b> <b>extreme</b> events than <b>to</b> more ordinary news. We have significant evidence that there is no standard reaction of stock markets <b>to</b> <b>extreme</b> events...|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes <b>to</b> <b>extremes</b> to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

Once bottled, a wine may be exposed <b>to</b> <b>extremes</b> of temperature and humidity, as well as violent movement during transportation and storage. These may cause cloudiness, sedimentation and/or the formation of tartrate crystals; more seriously, they may also cause spoilage or the production of carbonic gas.|$|E

25|$|He {{picks up}} {{narratives}} left hanging from previous albums, magnifies recurring themes and takes signature production techniques <b>to</b> <b>extremes.</b> The album's structure – a seamless {{ebb and flow}} of interlinked songs – is dizzyingly grandiose, underpinned by a complementary sense of theatre and elegance. Most importantly, though, through these devices, Nash reveals {{more and more of the}} contradictions and complexities at the core of his work: the instability generated by his obsessive examination of traditional R tropes – love, sex, money – from every possible angle; the frictions of his own fractured self-perception.|$|E
25|$|Word {{order in}} Old Norse was {{generally}} much freer than in Modern English because Old Norse and Old English are synthetic languages, where added prefixes and suffixes {{to the root}} word (the core noun, verb, adjective or adverb) carry grammatical meanings, whereas Middle English and Modern English use word order to carry grammatical information, so-called analytic languages. This freedom is exploited to the full in skaldic verse and taken <b>to</b> <b>extremes</b> far beyond what would be natural in prose. Other words can intervene between a base-word and its genitive determinant, and occasionally between {{the elements of a}} compound word (tmesis). Kennings, and even whole clauses, can be interwoven. Ambiguity is usually less than it would be if an English text were subjected to the same contortions, thanks to the more elaborate morphology of Old Norse.|$|E
25|$|Donald (Stephen Merchant) and Emily (Halle Berry) {{are on a}} date {{together}} at a Mexican restaurant. Tired of typical first dates, Emily challenges Donald to a game of truth or dare. She dares him to grab a man's buttocks, and he follows with daring her to blow out the birthday candles on a blind boy's cake. The game rapidly escalates <b>to</b> <b>extremes,</b> in which both of them get plastic surgery and tattoos, and humiliate themselves. When Donald and Emily arrive back at Emily's apartment, they praise their date. Donald tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming she's not attracted to Asian men (which he was surgically altered to resemble). It is revealed that she was joking and invites him {{to have sex with}} her as she shows him her enlarged breasts.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} of road users would often be taken <b>to</b> <b>extremes</b> in schemes: by moving motor vehicles onto dedicated routes, their interaction with pedestrians or cycle routes might occur less often but at higher speeds than before, and thus {{be far more}} hazardous or intimidating. New towns like Milton Keynes could avoid this by placing motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians on separate levels and routes. However, their interaction would be a particular problem in the established towns, especially in the transition to suburban areas where separation would be more ambiguous and inconsistent. In the search for low casualty rates, urban planners now look to detailed road designs and traffic calming to counteract this affect by reducing vehicle speeds, or take more dramatic steps by destroying this separation and mixing all road users together through shared space planning.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, {{based on}} {{experience}} with the wooden-winged Vickers Vixen biplane, where the wings proved vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>extremes</b> of temperature and humidity, designed a set of metal wings for the Vixen, with which it became the Vickers Vivid, and in parallel, designed an all-metal general purpose biplane, the Vickers Type 131, hoping to replace the DH.9A in that role. In 1927, the British Air Ministry issued Specification 26/27 for a DH.9A replacement which, to save money, had to use as many components of the DH.9A as possible because the RAF held large stocks of DH.9A spares. Vickers submitted the Type 131 design to the Ministry but, as it did not {{make use of the}} required DH9A components, did not receive a contract for a prototype. However Vickers decided to build a single prototype as a private venture for evaluation against the specification.|$|E
25|$|Moldavian revolutionaries {{arrived in}} Iaşi after {{violence}} {{had broken out}} in Wallachia. On 8 April 1848, a few great boyars opposed to Sturdza, younger liberal boyars, {{and representatives of the}} middle class and other urban classes, perhaps a thousand in all, met in the Hotel Petersburg to decide on a course of action. This meeting was the culmination of several weeks of small private gatherings and several public manifestos denouncing despotism, all occasioned by news of the events in Paris, Vienna and Berlin. Moderates prevailed, persuading the gathering to support a petition to the prince setting forth all their grievances and proposing suitable reforms. They also agreed to dissolve their assembly and all other associations right after delivering the petition. Such caution seems principally to have been inspired by fear that the urban lower classes and peasantry would push the protest movement <b>to</b> <b>extremes.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{scientist}} and former astrologer, Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted {{a large scale}} scientific test, involving {{more than one hundred}} cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually 3 to 5 others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart. A further test involved 45 confident astrologers, with an average of 10 years experience and 160 test subjects (out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire <b>to</b> <b>extremes.</b> The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals age, and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all.|$|E
