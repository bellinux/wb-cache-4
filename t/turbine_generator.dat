5|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
5|$|The nominal 250 MW solar {{electric}} generating facility generates steam {{in solar}} steam generators, which will expand through a steam <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> to produce electrical power from twin, independently operable solar fields, each feeding a 125 MW power island. The plant should generate 617,000 MWh of power annually, enough power {{for more than}} 88,000 households and will prevent the emission of over 430 kilotons of CO2 a year. Pacific Gas & Electric has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement.|$|E

25|$|This small shaft deflection, only {{detectable}} by eccentricity meters, {{would be}} enough to cause damaging vibrations to the entire steam <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> unit when it is restarted. The shaft is therefore automatically turned at low speed (about one percent rated speed) by the barring gear until it has cooled sufficiently to permit a complete stop.|$|E
25|$|This {{subterranean}} {{power station}} uses both pumped-storage and {{the gravity of}} natural stream flow to generate electricity through four reversible Francis <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> assemblies.

50|$|The {{power plant}} {{consists}} of multiple-shaft combined cycle unit with one steam turbine-generator, three gas <b>turbine</b> <b>generators</b> and three heat recovery steam generators, designed {{for natural gas}} firing. The gas <b>turbine</b> <b>generators</b> came fromm General Electric with F-class technology and was shipped in 2002. Each has 18-stage axial compressor and 3-stage turbine. It also features a cold-end drive and axial exhaust.|$|R
25|$|The {{peak level}} of {{generation}} for the combined turbines is about 200 MW. This exceeds the projected peak electricity needs of Northland. It would have environmental benefits in offsetting annual carbon emissions from a thermal-based, gas <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> of 575,000 tonnes of carbon. The project is costed at about $600 million {{and to be}} economic {{would have to be}} scaled up rapidly to near full capacity.|$|E
25|$|The steam turbine-driven {{generators}} have {{auxiliary systems}} {{enabling them to}} work satisfactorily and safely. The steam <b>turbine</b> <b>generator,</b> being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft. The shaft therefore requires not only supports but also {{has to be kept}} in position while running. To minimize the frictional resistance to the rotation, the shaft has a number of bearings. The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low-friction material like Babbitt metal. Oil lubrication is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated.|$|E
25|$|This 200 MW {{station has}} three {{hydraulic}} <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> units, causes {{less than one}} half square kilometre of new flooding, and has only a small reservoir. This project had the most extensive environmental review of any generating project in Manitoba. Participation of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) First Nation was passed by a June 2006 referendum by NCN members. This partnership between NCN and Manitoba Hydro will allow advancement of the in-service date to 2012 and opportunities for additional export revenue. Otherwise the domestic load growth would not require this new capacity until several years later.|$|E

25|$|Most nuclear {{stations}} require {{two distinct}} sources of offsite {{power feeding station}} service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the station's switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition in some nuclear stations the <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E
25|$|On 29 December 1993 Union Rotorua {{was about}} 27 {{miles south of}} Sydney Heads, en route for Melbourne, when a fire {{broke out in the}} gas turbine house. It was {{established}} that the seat of the fire was in one of the cubicles of the 6.6 kilovolt switchboard, which distributed power from the gas <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.|$|E
25|$|At {{times of}} low {{electrical}} demand, excess generation capacity {{is used to}} pump water into the upper reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating electricity. Reversible turbine/generator assemblies act as a combined pump and <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> unit (usually a Francis turbine design). In open-loop systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows, while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river. Plants that do not use pumped-storage {{are referred to as}} conventional hydroelectric plants; conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage by deferring output until needed.|$|E

25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's <b>turbine</b> <b>generator,</b> preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Turbine</b> <b>generators</b> in a {{power system}} have stored kinetic energy due to their large {{rotating}} masses.

This, however, leads to a decrease in the stored kinetic energy of the <b>turbine</b> <b>generators.</b> Since the mechanical power of these turbines correlates with the delivered electrical power, the <b>turbine</b> <b>generators</b> have a decrease in angular velocity, which is directly proportional to a decrease in frequency in synchronous generators.
