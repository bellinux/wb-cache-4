40|$|Road freight {{transport}} {{continues to grow}} in Germany and generates 6 % of the country’s CO 2 emissions. In logistics, many decisions influence the energy efficiency of trucks, but causalities are not well understood. Little {{work has been done}} on quantifying the potential for further CO 2 reduction and the effect of specific activities, such as introducing computer assisted scheduling systems to trucking firms. A survey was survey out and linked fuel consumption to transport performance parameters in 50 German haulage companies during 2003. Emission efficiency ranged from 0. 8 tonne-km to 26 tonne-km for 1 kg CO 2 emissions. The results show potential for improvements given a low level of vehicle usage and load factor levels, scarce use of lightweight vehicle design, poorly selected vehicles and a high proportion of empty runs.

40|$|In this {{interdisciplinary}} research I {{set out to}} {{develop an understanding of}} the stages in which human participants experience the application Radiomap, an interactive <b>telematic</b> <b>application</b> mapping live radio stations upon a photorealistic live map of the world, developed as part of this practice-based research program. It was applied in two iterative studies, first in a study using a screen-based version of the application, followed by a study using an immersive, telematic environment. Both studies capture and analyse participants experience via interviews in an adapted Grounded Theory approach, resulting in different models of the stages of experience. This includes diagrams of experiential stages as well as telematic set-ups. A contextual review looks at media theory, media design practice, and relevant dimensions of Human-Computer Interaction research and how this discipline understands and describes telematic experiences. Parts of these dimensions are adapted to inform the methods and methodologies necessary for this research and also to discuss a selection of case studies of interactive art. These case studies, as part of the contextual review, are used to elucidate, establish and analyse the areas of interest Telematic Art, Transformation Art and Global Awareness Art and point to their intrinsic capabilities of not only extending our limited human senses to sense the natural world via remote sensors, but also to create a global awareness, in the sense of an awareness of the planet Earth, in this process. Relevant literature from art theory, philosophy and history of arts complements these examples to form a comprehensive and interdisciplinary system of research methods aided by diagrams and other visual aids depicting crucial experiential characteristics, such as spatiality and medium, which again inform the analysis of data. The conclusions present a critical theory of the different stages of experience that individuals using the application go through. It suggests that a combination of immersive telematics together with the transformation of data into another sensorial modality can create a platform for technological art that questions our relationship with technology and that this critical distance, as opposed to an overwhelming immersion, may aid this process in leaving space to reflect and contemplate this relationship. </p...|$|R

40|$|With new methods, {{strategies}} and systems of intelligent transport management the continuous increasing traffic {{has to be}} opposed to reduce its negative effects. The safety has to be improved {{and the number of}} casualties has to be reduced. Congestions should prevent for keeping emissions of noise and air pollution acceptable. Basis of all immovative management strategies are reliable on traffic flow data. to improve the database significantly is the aim of a lot of current projects around the globe. The development of traffic counts, probe vehicle, and remote sensing are the most important topics in this context. The Institute of Transport Research of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is developing a procedure to measure traffic flow parameters using the low earth orbit radar satellite TerraSAR-X. The SAR-sensor has some advantages over optical sensors: The procedure is independent of daylight or weather conditions and it is possible to detect cars an measure their speed in one and the same detection. But there are also some disadvantages because the processing of SAR-data is very complex and {{it is not possible to}} say if the requirements of modern intelligent transport management systems could be fulfilled by SAR-sensors systems. This paper shows a proposal how to define the requirements of intelligent transport systems (ITS) for satellite based traffic flow measurement. for defining this requirements four different factors have to be analysed: - possible applications, - mathematical analysis, - applicable regulations and relevant laws, and - important user groups. For analysing the applicable regulations not only national law and orders will be account. It would be a system for cross boarder data collection (a low earth orbit satellite system is global available) and therefore international regulations has to be analysed too. The global availability is one of the major advantages of such a space borne system. Most of the individual parameters are depending on different applications. Therefore it is important to have a close look on these traffic applications. The share of the satellite system for each application has to be analysed. There are already a lot of mathematical analysis's dealing with local and instantaneous traffic flow measurements. The most important will be shown. But there are also new studies dealing with the potential of measured traffic density. Each car and herewith each platoon of cars can be measured. This is much more detailed information than current traffic detectors can realize. In this context also the detection fault rate has to be analysed. There are a lot of <b>telematic</b> <b>application</b> and also different traffic management systems. All of them with its special user groups have to be analysed. It is not realistic to operate all possible application with such a system for traffic flow measurements therefore a ranking based on the best benefit for the important user groups is helpful.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} is the {{evaluation}} of methods and techniques {{in order to make the}} diagnosis more objective and also the possibility of <b>application</b> of <b>telematic</b> protocols in cytopathology departments is investigated, for diagnostic and educational purposes. Material and Methods 268 specimen of breast FNA’s from 105 patients, have been studied and analyzed. The total of the slides were prerared with liquid-based cytology ThinPrep® method using automatic processor TP 2000. In thirty of the cases only one specimen was prepared because FNA offered less than 80. 000 cells. The rest 238 specimens were stained immunocytochemically. 29 parameters based on patterns, shapes, sizes, relationships between objects, texture of chromatine and other features were calculated with computerized image analysis methods. The digitized cytological images were compressed using JPEG standard and then the compressed images (at a compression level of 50 %) were sent via internet in a support telematic station (slave system), where they were analyzed indepedently from a different user, following the same methodology and using the same computerized image analysis techniques. Histological diagnosis with an estimation of the percentage of positive immunostain (Label Index), exists for all the specimen which were processed with immunocytochemical stains. Results The results show that cytologic diagnosis using computerized image analysis methods has better corellation with histopathologic diagnosis than with classical cytologic diagnosis using optical microscope. For the whole number of measured parameters, in various levels of compression, no statistically important differences were observed. This fact enable cytopathologists to apply telecytology and telepathology protocols to their laboratories for morphometry and quantitative immunocytochemistry. The results of <b>telematic</b> <b>application</b> also show a very good corellation between cytologic diagnosis using computerized image analysis methods in the laboratory and cytologic diagnosis using the same methodology from remote user. The evaluation of cytologic diagnosis in relation to histopathologic for the measurement of the percentage of positive immunostain (Label Index) shows higher levels of aggreement for the oestrogen and progesterone receptors Er, Pr and the nuclear antibody p 53 than for nuclear antibody ki- 67. Conclusions The application of image analysis and image processing techniques contributes: · To make the cytologic diagnosis more objective and precise with measurement of morphometrical and texture quantitative features if only restrict quality control and quality assuranse protocols are applied. · to the potential quantitative estimation of imprortant for the diagnoses and the treatment plan parameters, like Quick Score, whilst with visual observation the parameter estimation can be only semiquantitative. In the present study a method of Quick Score measurement using continuus scale is proposed. Additionally cytologic laboratories are able to adopt telematic protocol for diagnostical and educational purposes in morphometry and quantitative immunocytochemistry applications following the next steps : · Digitization of cytological images and application compression protocols using JPEG format · Send the data via Internet using ADSL line or faster networks The induction of this methodology and the application of the proposed restrict quality control and quality assuranse protocols enable interactive laboratories collaboration with reasonable funding, and also provide qualitative health services to peripheral regions of our country. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the factors that}} influence secondary school students’ choice of higher education options in Spain today and explores the implications and benefits of establishing provider-client relationships between universities and students. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach using questionnaires to demonstrate the hypothesis and achieve the objectives. We have prepared a questionnaire via <b>telematic</b> LimeSurvey <b>application</b> consisting of twenty-four closed questions. Findings: Results depict that the leading criteria for Spanish students interested in pursuing studies in communication sciences were a university’s reputation and excellence and the quality of its educational programmes. In terms of sources of information related to universities and their degree programmes, Spanish communication sciences students placed the highest value on direct and experiential sources. Spanish students interested in pursuing degrees in communication sciences preferred public universities over private universities. Research limitations: It is a descriptive paper. The sample could have been larger and have covered the entire universe of communication schools in Spain. Practical implications: Gain in-depth insight into the academic, cultural, and sociodemographic characteristics of students who choose to pursue an undergraduate degree in communications sciences in Spain. Ascertain which sources of information proved to be the most valuable to prospective students in choosing a university and degree programme and the other factors that influenced their choices by means of a survey involving first-year undergraduate communication sciences students. Use the results of this survey to rank the criteria used by students when choosing a university and degree programme. Gain a clearer picture of how parents and friends influence a student’s choice of degree programmes and universities. Social implications: Knowing the factors of choice and sources of information that define his choice of the University and the Faculty of Communication Sciences and analyze if there is an adequate marketing specifically university. Originality/value: Today’s universities must operate in much the same manner as businesses and corporations in order to survive. This new scenario pits one university against another in a race to attract the highest number of incoming students.

It analyses driver’s style and then provides tips and recommendations on how to modify and improve it to achieve CO 2 reductions—and save money on fuel.

40|$|Nowadays, the WWW is {{believed}} to be the ideal technological platform for the introduction of online <b>telematic</b> <b>applications</b> as well as information systems in enterprise intranets due to its wide acceptance and standardisation (W 3 C). In the majority of cases, the databases supporting such novel applications are hosted by RDBMSs. This paper touches upon the incompatible nature of WWW compliant database applications and classical database applications (developed with Embedded SQL/ 3 GLs, 4 GLs, etc.). The WWW is often blamed for the stateless character of one of its constituents; the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The so-called “user session ” concept is not applicable in its client/server architecture. Communication between clients and servers is realised by means of fairly simple request-response interactions (“hits”) which are treated independently (without memory- state) by servers. We propose an architecture for the deployment of stateful database applications in the context of conventional WWW servers. In this architecture, state information preserved in the WWW client as well as in specialised agents that operate behind the WWW server, provides the required basis for a “session-aware ” database application. The main benefits of this architecture are that it doesn’t modify existing server software and requires minimum programming effort for the porting of existing “session-aware ” applications to the WWW environment...|$|E

Subsequently, we present results from a study of two use cases performed within Ericsson Research. The authors use learnings from these use cases and the current industry status to form a general understanding on the challenges that MNOs will face as network infrastructure providers for automotive applications, as well as strategic options for MNOs to address these challenges...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{tested the}} merits of 9 common workload assessment techniques with relatively short periods of workload in a car-driving task. Twelve participants drove an instrumented car and performed a visually loading task and a mentally loading task for 10, 30, and 60 s. The results show that 10 -s periods of visual and mental workload can be measured successfully with subjective ratings and secondary task performance. With respect to longer loading periods (30 and 60 s), steering frequency {{was found to be}} sensitive to visual workload, and skin conductance response (SCR) was sensitive to mental workload. The results lead to preliminary guidelines that will help applied researchers to determine which techniques are best suited for assessing visual and mental workload. In recent years, major research programs in Europe, the United States, and Japan have boosted the development of information systems in road traffic. In Europe, these systems are referred to as transport telematics, but in the United States the term intelligent transport systems (ITS) is more common. It is generally expected that transport <b>telematic</b> <b>applications</b> will change the nature of car driving considerably in the near future. A vast array of telematics systems is currently being considered. Some well-known examples are route guidance systems, anticollision systems, systems for monitoring driver status, and parking advice systems. However, installing even a subset of these telematic systems, many of which are aimed at supporting the driver and increasing traffic safety, may lead to distraction and overload of the driver and will result in increased accident rates. There-fore, care should be taken to design telematic...|$|E

This under-diagnosis, signifies, on the one hand, a lowering or loss of health, and on the other, an increase in costs, since it has been demonstrated that patients with undiagnosed or untreated SAHS are higher consumers of health service resources and have higher work absenteeism, while these costs are reduced in SAHS patients treated with CPAP. Therefore, we find ourselves faced with the need to diagnose and suitably treat the largest possible number of patients who suffer from SAHS. The diagnostic method of choice continues to be supervised nocturnal PSG in the sleep laboratory, however, the future of SAHS diagnosis is inevitably moving towards the use of simplified systems with a high sensitivity and specificity. In this sense, the Respiratory Polygraphy represents an alternative tool for the diagnosis of SAHS, being able to be carried out in the home of the patient, just like the Auto-CPAP systems. Thus, the current approach to SAHS has changed and therefore, a patient with a high probability of suffering from SAHS, is able to have a RP carried out at home which might diagnose SAHS and later to have the CPAP adjusted to the optimum pressure level, as a recording using Auto-CPAP, could be carried out at home. With this new approach to SAHS, waiting lists could be reduced and thus reduce the under-diagnosis. All this brings about an implicit saving of resources. The place of diagnosis will basically be the home, and in this sense, the development of <b>telematic</b> <b>applications</b> will contribute significantly to the modification of diagnostic strategies. The success of this form of approach to SAHS, will be established with a suitable selection of subsidiary diagnosed patients and adjustment of home treatment, therefore, each sleep unit must set up its own diagnostic-therapeutic strategy which may be more cost effective...|$|E
40|$|Rapid advancements in {{embedded}} technology enable {{vehicles to}} become equipped with embedded on-board computation and wireless communication capabilities. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) is an emerging research field that demands efficient delivery of information between vehicles {{for the creation}} of useful and usable <b>telematic</b> <b>applications</b> operating in nomadic large-scale environments. Some interesting inter-vehicular applications made possible by this technology include accident avoidance, incident notification, congestion monitoring and parking space allocation. For these types of applications it is crucial that the peers receive the right information at the right time and the right place to make informed decisions. However, due to the ephemeral, highly dynamic and mobile nature of the vehicular networks we face four major challenges: (1) how to identify what information is relevant to take actions or make decisions, (2) how to disseminate the relevant information to the interested peers efficiently, (3) how to coordinate with other peers and (4) last but not the least, how to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms and protocols being proposed for the previous concerns. This thesis aims to optimize communication in large scale vehicular networks using context-aware strategies in order to address these challenges. We optimize communication by maximizing throughput, reducing network traffic utilization with context-based routing and filtering-out irrelevant information. To address challenge one, we define a mechanism to compute the quality of the information and the peers in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to ensure that vehicles can take well-informed decisions. The application developers and the system architects are offered the flexibility to define application specific quality requirements. Thus, we provide a two-fold solution in which on the one hand we focus {{on the quality of the}} information and on the other hand we aim at determining the reputation of the nodes involved in the communication. This helps to eliminate the use of erroneous, ambiguous and imprecise information provided by unknown entities. To address challenge two, we design and develop context-aware algorithms that can propagate this information among the peers intelligently and evaluate these algorithms on the basis of certain network metrics. Together, these objectives lead to an efficient way to optimize communication by eliminating unnecessary information in large scale vehicular networks. To address challenge three, we present two extensions of the work on intelligent algorithms for adaptive context-aware communication. First, we describe a context-based grouping mechanism which allows the definition of groups of peers (vehicles) based on common spatio-temporal characteristics and shared interests. Each group defined by these characteristics specifies which context information can be distributed inside the group between peers. This approach of context-based grouping efficiently manages context distribution and significantly reduces irrelevant/redundant information over a large scale network. Second, we present another extension of the work on intelligent algorithms for adaptive context-aware communication. We investigate how exploiting a social network helps peers in large-scale highly dynamic vehicular networks to obtain timely and relevant information. We propose a three-leaved mirror approach and demonstrate this by providing a ubiquitous-help-system (UHS) which resides on top of a vehicular network. Our approach involves a comparison of social and spatial relevance between two peers in terms of the spatial closeness. Finally, we illustrate with the help of simulated evaluation that the use of social networking capabilities combined with knowledge about the spatio-temporal context significantly improves purposeful interaction between peers. These interactions improve in terms of both the efficiency of the data dissemination, the relevancy and the quality of the delivered information. To address challenge four, we propose a framework for context-aware adaptive information sharing that allows the evaluation and comparison of alternative information routing schemes (i. e. algorithms and protocols) using network-based metrics to measure a variety of quality attributes. This thesis presents a number of real-world VANET applications and scenarios that help us to implement and compare our solutions with the state-of-the-art. This thesis also provides the foundations for the further design and development of various context-aware applications in VANETs. nrpages: 180 status: publishe...|$|E
