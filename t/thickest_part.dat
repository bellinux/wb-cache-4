50|$|Drafting {{is done by}} {{pinching}} off a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back while twist is added to it. The active hand pulls back until the yarn is the desired thickness. The passive hand controls how much twist is allowed in the drafting yarn: too much twist and the yarn won't draft; too little and the yarn will break. Twist concentrates in the thin areas of the yarn, solidifying these. Thus the tension doesn't stretch these parts thinner, but instead drafts the <b>thicker</b> <b>parts</b> until all the yarn is approximately the same thickness. This {{has the effect of}} automatically thinning out the <b>thicker</b> <b>parts,</b> which is what allows this technique to work.|$|R
