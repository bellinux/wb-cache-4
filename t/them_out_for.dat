5|$|A {{whole week}} passed before Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, {{starting}} with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a mere 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 {{to give him}} his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{appointed}} {{a group of}} insurance experts to study the state's policies and put <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> bid, ultimately saving $2 million. He also required competitive bids from banks where state funds were deposited; the extra interest generated by this process generated an additional $50 million in revenue to the general fund. He opened communications and contacts with Japan, {{setting the stage for}} future economic relations between that country and Kentucky. Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive bidding for government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E
5|$|The welcome {{extended}} by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was {{in contrast to}} that of Scotland. The morning they arrived in Belfast they were met by several IRFU officials who took <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> breakfast. The arrival in Ireland also marked a homecoming for the captain Dave Gallaher, {{who was born in}} County Donegal, but had moved to New Zealand at the age of four. Thousands awaited the All Blacks when they arrived in the Dublin train station. On the Thursday before the Test, both teams attended the theatre together; sitting alternatively so they could better mix.|$|E

5|$|White was in {{the habit}} of {{creating}} new dish concepts late at night, sometimes drawing sketches of the plating directly into the pages of French cookbooks he had picked up during the course of his career, or at other times selecting a protein and writing a long list of potential accompaniments. These concepts would then be handed to his head chef in the morning, who was told to copy <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> future use.|$|E
5|$|In {{a three-day}} match {{starting}} on Thursday, 15 August, the England XI defeated Gloucestershire at The Oval by 6 wickets after Grace {{had won the}} toss for his county and decided to bat. They scored 118 (Grace 25) and England replied with 163 (Grace 3–67). Rain prevented play {{for most of the}} Friday and Gloucestershire in their second innings had reached 27–1 {{at the end of the}} day. On the Saturday, England bowled <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 118 (Grace 29) with Tom Emmett taking 8–51 (12–93 in the match). Grace took 3–39 in England's second innings as they made 7–44 to win by six wickets. Midwinter suffered a hand injury in the field when he attempted to stop a powerful drive played by George Ulyett; he was unable to play again in 1878.|$|E
5|$|In late 2003, he was {{selected}} for the India Under-19 team to compete in an Asian youth ODI competition in Pakistan, {{where he was the}} leading bowler with 18 wickets at 7.38, with an economy rate of 3.54. This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket-taker. He was named as the player of the tournament, which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final. Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9/16 against Bangladesh, helping to bowl <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 34, and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final, taking 3/33. Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat, compiling scores of 32, 28 and 34. Pathan returned to India and took 3/51 and 1/33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season, against Andhra Pradesh. This resulted in him being selected for the Indian national squad for the 2003–04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia.|$|E

5|$|On {{the desert}} planet, the search begins for a {{suitable}} source of lime to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E
5|$|The Irish played yearly {{first-class}} matches {{with the}} Scots, only interrupted by world wars, until 1999, but all their other cricket depended upon touring international sides finding it convenient {{to include a}} visit to Ireland in their schedules. However, Ireland sometimes surprised Test nations on these occasions, beating the West Indies by 60 runs in a three-day match in Dublin in 1928, for example; it was Ireland's first match against the West Indies. In 1969, in a match played at Sion Mills in County Tyrone, the team defeated a West Indian side including Clive Lloyd and Clyde Walcott by nine wickets, after bowling <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 25. This {{was the last time}} Ireland defeated a touring side until 2003, when they beat Zimbabwe by ten wickets.|$|E
5|$|The players went {{on strike}} on July 13, 1970 after the owners locked <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a brief period. The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners {{threatened}} to cancel the season. Due to the new agreement, the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs, and minimum salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 for veterans. Also, players' pensions were improved and dental care {{was added to the}} players' insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league's retirement board and the right to impartial arbitration for injury grievances. Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication. Attorney Ed Garvey was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.|$|E

6000|$|One {{night as}} we were all seated around the {{kerosene}} lamp my father said, [...] "Well, Belle, I suppose we'll have to take these young ones down to town and fit <b>'em</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> school." [...] These words so calmly uttered filled our minds with visions of new boots, new caps and new books, and though we went obediently to bed we hardly slept, so excited were we, and at breakfast next morning {{not one of us}} could think of food. All our desires converged upon the wondrous expedition--our first visit to town.|$|R
