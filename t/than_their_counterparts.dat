5|$|In the mid-12th century Ireland {{was ruled}} {{by a number of}} local kings, {{although}} their authority was more limited <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in the rest of western Europe. Mainstream Europeans regarded the Irish as relatively barbarous and backward. In the 1160s King Diarmait Mac Murchada was deposed as King of Leinster by the High King of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair. Diarmait turned to Henry for assistance in 1167, and the English king agreed to allow Diarmait to recruit mercenaries within his empire. Diarmait put together a force of Anglo-Norman and Flemish mercenaries drawn from the Welsh Marches, including Richard de Clare. With his new supporters, he reclaimed Leinster but died shortly afterwards in 1171; de Clare then claimed Leinster for himself. The situation in Ireland was tense and the Anglo-Normans heavily outnumbered.|$|E

5|$|This puffin has a black {{crown and}} back, pale grey cheek patches and white underparts. Its broad, boldly marked {{red and black}} beak and orange legs {{contrast}} with its plumage. It moults while at sea {{in the winter and}} some of the bright-coloured facial characteristics are lost. The external appearance of the adult male and female are identical except that the male is usually slightly larger. The juvenile has similar plumage but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, its bill is less broad and is dark-grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern populations are typically larger <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in southern parts of the range. It is generally considered that these populations are different subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanians were {{generally}} less hospitable to Jews <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in Albania. Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, {{they tended to}} be more unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. Claims have been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the protection that Jews received in Kosovo {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E
5|$|The 8,000Australians {{captured}} by Germany and Italy were generally treated {{in accordance with}} the Geneva Conventions. The majority of these men were taken during the fighting in Greece and Crete in 1941, with the next largest group being 1,400airmen shot down over Europe. Like other western Allied POWs, the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany. As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies. These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths. Four Australians were also executed following a mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. While the Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in World WarI, it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyze the {{acoustic}} properties of the oral and nasal vowels, in terms of the values of the formants, the fundamental frequencies, the anti-formants, the intensity, and the bandwidths. The data were recorded and analyzed using the Praat program. The results show that there are changes of the average values of all the properties. The fundamental frequencies of the nasal vowels are all higher <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterpart</b> oral vowels. The hypothesis is correct for this acoustic property. However, by the test of significance t-test, only the nasal [ã] and diphthong [ũã] have significantly higher frequencies. The results of the average of intensity show that nasal vowels/ diphthongs may not always have higher intensity <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterpart</b> oral vowels/ diphthongs.   DOI: [URL]...|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} and political differences between western and eastern Virginia began to grow. Following Virginia's secession from the Union in 1861, the Restored Government of Virginia was established at Wheeling during the American Civil War. Despite West Virginia receiving Union statehood on June 20, 1863, sympathies and loyalties within the state's borders remained divided, especially within areas economically dependent upon the plantation system. However, slaveowners in western Virginia tended to own fewer slaves <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in eastern Virginia and many did not support Virginia's secession. In Mason County, where small farms were reliant upon slavery, its residents overwhelmingly supported the Union cause. During the war, many plantations in West Virginia served as preferred venues for military headquarters and meeting places for both Union and Confederate military officers due to their adequate accommodations and resources. Altona near Charles Town was utilized as a military headquarters and meeting place for Union generals Philip Sheridan and Ulysses S. Grant, with Sheridan making use of the farm's horses and carriage. Other plantations, like Mill Island and Willow Wall near Moorefield, and Elmwood near Shepherdstown, were utilized as hospitals for wounded soldiers and irregulars.|$|E
5|$|Before the Normans arrived, Anglo-Saxon {{governmental}} {{systems were}} more sophisticated <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in Normandy. All of England {{was divided into}} administrative units called shires, with subdivisions; the royal court was the centre of government, and a justice system based on local and regional tribunals existed to secure the rights of free men. Shires were run by officials known as shire reeves or sheriffs. Most medieval governments were always on the move, holding court wherever the weather and food or other matters were best at the moment; England had a permanent treasury at Winchester before William's conquest. One major reason for {{the strength of the}} English monarchy was the wealth of the kingdom, built on the English system of taxation that included a land tax, or the geld. English coinage was also superior to most of the other currency in use in northwestern Europe, and the ability to mint coins was a royal monopoly. The English kings had also developed the system of issuing writs to their officials, in addition to the normal medieval practice of issuing charters. Writs were either instructions to an official or group of officials, or notifications of royal actions such as appointments to office or a grant of some sort.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 29,000Australians {{were taken}} {{prisoner}} by the Axis during the war, {{the bulk of}} them members of the Australian Army. During the fighting in the Middle East and Greece, 7,116 Australian soldiers were taken prisoner by German and Italian forces. Of these men, 3,109 were captured at Crete and 2,065 on the mainland of Greece. Most of the other POWs {{were members of the}} 9th Division captured during the retreat from Cyrenaica in early 1941, the siege of Tobruk or the fighting near El Alamein in mid-1942. Like other western Allied POWs, the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany and were generally treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies. These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths. As the war drew to a close, a unit designated the AIF Reception Group (United Kingdom) was established near Eastbourne in England to provide accommodation and support for the POWs once they were released. By August 1945 all the former Australian POWs in Europe had embarked on ships bound for Australia. While Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in World WarI, it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment.|$|E

5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in other German labor federations.|$|E
