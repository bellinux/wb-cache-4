40|$|This project {{investigates the}} EU as a {{provider}} of security outside the EU. As an example, we chose to analyse, why the EU decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> the Central African Republic. Our analysis is grounded in a securitization framework and therefore focusses on how {{the conflict in the}} Central African Republic has been constructed as a problem within an EU context. To operationalise the analysis we utilised Kingdon’s “Three Stream Model”, which provided a more comprehensive understanding of why the EU decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> the Central African Republic. Our main findings were: 1) several securitizing actors managed to move the conflict in the CAR from being a condition to being a problem with speech acts constructing the conflict as a security problem {{within the context of the}} EU. 2) The institutional framework of the CSDP and the CFSP created a platform where the decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> the Central African Republic was technically feasible. 3) The positive attitudes in civil society regarding military interventions with reference to humanitarian concerns established a context where the EU’s decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily was made possible. Consequently, the three streams formed a policy window where the adoption of the decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> the Central African Republic was made possible in the end...|$|R

5|$|But in {{addition}} to being militarily exhausted, the Commonwealth was now pressured by several European diplomacies to suspend further military activities, to allow Gustavus Adolphus <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Roman Empire. The Truce of Altmark left Livonia north of the Daugava and all Prussian and Livonian seaports except for Danzig, Puck, Königsberg, and Libau in hands of the Swedes, who were also allowed to charge duty on trade through Danzig.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Ambassador Bishop's {{visit to}} Central Command, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In 1979, the US {{negotiated}} {{access to an}} airport and port in both Mogadishu and Berbera; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area, maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to territorial disputes, the League also tried <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its {{fight against the}} international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarians {{who lived}} in the westernmost parts of the Pontic steppes were {{occasionally}} hired by neighboring powers <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> their wars. For instance, they invaded Moravia in alliance with Arnulf of East Francia in 892. Their intervention in a conflict between the First Bulgarian Empire and the Byzantine Empire caused a joint counter-invasion by the Bulgars and Pechenegs. The Hungarians were forced to leave the Pontic steppes and to cross the Carpathians in search of a new homeland around 895.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of Taraki, albeit short-lived, was always marked by controversies. Taraki launched a land reform on 1 January 1979 which {{proved to be}} highly unpopular and, along with his government's other reforms, led to a popular backlash which initiated the Afghan civil war. Despite repeated attempts throughout his reign, Taraki proved unable to persuade the Soviet Union <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> support of the restoration of civil order.|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's ability <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476.

5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> <b>In</b> the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E

25|$|Texas {{has over}} 1,000 public school districtsall {{but one of}} the school districts in Texas are independent, {{separate}} from any form of municipal government. School districts may (and often do) cross city and county boundaries. Independent school districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) oversees these districts, providing supplemental funding, but its jurisdiction is limited mostly <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> <b>in</b> poorly performing districts.|$|R

5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|As we {{understand}} the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944 Treloar was overworked {{and unhappy}} {{to be in}} Melbourne instead of at the Memorial. He was also uncomfortable with {{the way in which}} Bean and the AWM's acting {{director}} Arthur Bazley were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> its management. This degree of intervention frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict between the two men who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a ruling on what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take a job in the Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a number}} of {{indigenous}} stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the Western Apache tribe, stories {{can be used to}} warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> <b>in</b> her son's life.|$|R

She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former name {{had been given to}} a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> the Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{the effect}} of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. Candlemas was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on Palm Sunday to the Lindenhof, and triptychs {{remained}} covered and closed after Lent. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.|$|E
5|$|In 1059 {{the same}} papal bull that {{restricted}} suffrage to the cardinals also recognised {{the authority of}} the Holy Roman Emperor (at the time Henry IV), but only as a concession made by the pope, declaring that the Holy Roman Emperor had no authority <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073-1085) was the last Pope to submit to the interference of the Holy Roman Emperors. The breach between him and the Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor's role. In 1122 the Holy Roman Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms, accepting the papal decision.|$|E
