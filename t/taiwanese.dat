5|$|You Are the Apple of My Eye grossed {{more than}} NT$$20 {{million at the}} <b>Taiwanese</b> box office during its soft launch. This makes it the first <b>Taiwanese</b> film to gross over NT$$20 million before its {{official}} release date. The film crossed the NT$200 million mark ten days after its official opening. In total, the film earned over NT$420 million at the <b>Taiwanese</b> box office, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2011 in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal <b>Taiwanese</b> {{pop singer}} A-mei and Cantopop singer Eason Chan {{presented}} {{the award for}} Best Mandarin Male Singer.|$|E
5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E
5|$|Across {{classical}} music to easy listening, folk and pop style songs, Westenra has performed songs in English, Māori, Irish, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Portuguese, Latin, Japanese, Standard Mandarin Chinese, Catalan, and <b>Taiwanese</b> Hokkien.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} high speed railway system in Taiwan, THSRC started {{operation}} in 2007 {{with a lot}} of foreign talents including French and German train drivers and operation controllers in the Operation Control Center (OCC). At the same time, THSRC also started to train local drivers and controllers. Since May 2008, all controllers working in the OCC have been <b>Taiwanese,</b> and since October 2008, all train drivers have been <b>Taiwanese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chongqing {{was ranked}} among the top ten most {{attractive}} cities to investing by a <b>Taiwanese</b> report, and {{is also one of}} the National Central Cities.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term in office, Tainan City became the first <b>Taiwanese</b> city to enter the Alliance for Healthy Cities of the World Health Organization. In addition, Tainan also became the first <b>Taiwanese</b> city to enter the Global Cities Dialogue. Hsu also {{believes}} that Tainan should become a city of international tourism and culture, and he is working towards that purpose. In September 2007, {{he spoke to the}} 2007 Asia-Pacific Cities Summit participants and stated that Tainan is blessed with natural, historic, cultural and humanistic characteristics, and that Tainan also possesses great conditions for high-tech, trade and investment development.|$|E
5|$|In September 1988, {{during the}} 20th anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation's founding, company {{chairman}} Chang Yung-fa announced his company's intentions to establish Taiwan's first private international airline. The {{opportunity to create}} a major <b>Taiwanese</b> airline had just arisen following {{a decision by the}} <b>Taiwanese</b> government to liberalise the country's air transportation system. Government requirements still mandated global experience and financial capital requirements for any company seeking permission to initiate international airline service from Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore You Are the Apple of My Eye {{earned a}} total of SGD$675,000, making it the second-highest-grossing film in Singapore that weekend despite the film's NC-16 rating (which meant that only viewers over age 16 were admitted); this {{surprised}} the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox. The film broke the record for highest opening weekend for a <b>Taiwanese</b> film in Singapore, previously held by the 2007 film Secret. It surpassed the performance of other <b>Taiwanese</b> films such as Monga, Cape No.7 and Lust, Caution. You Are the Apple of My Eye was the highest-grossing Asian film of 2011 at the Singapore box office, with earnings of SGD$2.93 million.|$|E
5|$|Japanese ethnographer Ino Kanori {{was charged}} {{with the task of}} {{surveying}} the entire population of <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines, applying the first systematic study of aborigines on Taiwan. Ino's research {{is best known for his}} formalization of eight peoples of <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines: Atayal, Bunun, Saisiat, Tsou, Paiwan, Puyuma, Ami and Pepo (Pingpu). This is the direct antecedent of the taxonomy used today to distinguish people groups that are officially recognized by the government.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{is one of}} the few Asian Americans in NBA history, and {{the first}} American of Chinese or <b>Taiwanese</b> descent to play in the league.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the current}} {{population}} of <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines, about 70% {{identify themselves as}} Christian. Moreover, many of the Plains groups have mobilized their members around predominantly Christian organizations; most notably the Taiwan Presbyterian Church and Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan {{fried chicken}} fillet: Chicken fillet {{prepared}} {{in a similar}} way to salt and pepper chicken, as one large piece eaten in a paper bag. Popular in <b>Taiwanese</b> night markets.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan's Austronesian {{speakers}} were formerly distributed {{over much}} of the island's rugged central mountain range and were concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains. The bulk of contemporary <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines now live in the mountains and in cities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Taiwanese</b> media {{reported}} that Lin declined {{an offer from}} the People's Republic of China {{to play in the}} same tournament; however, the Chinese Basketball Management Center denied having ever approached him.|$|E
5|$|The Past wall is {{designed}} by <b>Taiwanese</b> artist Tsai Ken. He stacked traditional building {{materials such as}} bricks, tiles, stones, wood, and bamboo to present the Hakka culture of the building.|$|E
5|$|The deep-rooted hostility between Aboriginals and (<b>Taiwanese)</b> Hoklo, and the Aboriginal {{communities}} effective KMT networks, {{contribute to}} Aboriginal skepticism against the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Aboriginals tendency {{to vote for}} the KMT.|$|E
5|$|Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air's {{route network}} was {{affected}} by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for <b>Taiwanese</b> airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries. Because <b>Taiwanese</b> carriers did not have direct access to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as interline destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.|$|E
5|$|At China box office, You Are the Apple of My Eye {{became the}} most popular <b>Taiwanese</b> film, surpassing the {{previous}} record set by Cape No. 7 in 2008. It was the third-highest-earning film on its debut weekend, grossing about 27 million yuan. The film subsequently crossed the 50-million-yuan-gross mark on 13 January 2012.|$|E
5|$|Chu {{was born}} in Albany, New York on January 30, 1984. His parents are of <b>Taiwanese</b> heritage, later immigrating to the United States. He moved several times growing up, due to his father's job in the {{chemical}} industry. During his childhood, Chu lived in Cranston, Rhode Island, {{spent a year in}} Boise, Idaho, then lived in Cerritos, California as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|During Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), {{the use of}} Pe̍h-ōe-jī was {{suppressed}} and it faced further countermeasures {{during the}} Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. <b>Taiwanese</b> Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the <b>Taiwanese</b> mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of pe̍h-ōe-jī have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.|$|E
5|$|Filipinos {{generally}} {{belong to}} several Asian ethnic groups classified linguistically {{as part of}} the Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian speaking people. It is believed that thousands of years ago Austronesian-speaking <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines migrated to the Philippines from Taiwan, bringing with them knowledge of agriculture and ocean-sailing, eventually displacing the earlier Negrito groups of the islands.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the blotchy swellshark adapts {{readily to}} captivity and has {{reproduced}} in public aquariums. This species is caught incidentally by Japanese and <b>Taiwanese</b> bottom trawlers {{and brought to}} market. Intensive commercial fishing within its range do not yet appear to have impacted its numbers, but until more data are available the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, 80 <b>Taiwanese</b> {{practitioners}} {{were blocked}} from entering Hong Kong, {{and again in}} 2007, hundreds more <b>Taiwanese</b> were blocked from entering Hong Kong or detained at the airport, These events set off a six-year human rights case that tested {{the integrity of the}} one country, two systems arrangement. In 2009, Falun Gong's case against the Hong Kong immigration department was dismissed. Months later, Hong Kong immigration officials denied visas to several members of the Falun Gong-affiliated Shen Yun dance company, which was scheduled to perform in the territory in January 2010. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho said the denial of the visas was a worrying new erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms, and damaged the reputation of Hong Kong as a liberal and open society. A court ruling in March 2010 overturned the Immigration Department's decision.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Apple secured <b>Taiwanese</b> {{rights to}} the iPad mark from the <b>Taiwanese</b> company Proview Electronics; in China the iPad mark was still owned by the {{subsidiary}} of Proview Electronics, Shenzhen company Proview Technology, as of April 2012. Proview Technology sued Apple over the {{rights to the}} mark in China in 2011; Apple counter-sued but lost and then appealed, with the case before the Xicheng district court, where Proview claimed $1.6 billion USD in damages. Apple paid Proview approximately $53,000 – $55,000 for the mark in 2009. In February 2012, Proview sued Apple in the Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging several permutations of fraud (intentional misrepresentation, concealment, inducement) and unfair competition. Apple paid $60 million to Proview to end the dispute in a court-mediated settlement in the Higher People's Court of Guangdong province; the U.S. case was thrown out of court.|$|E

Royal Laurel cabins on the Boeing 777 also feature an in-flight refreshment bar, and European wine selections are served.|$|E
5|$|In many districts <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the Kuomintang, {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the <b>Taiwanese</b> nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 2010, two <b>Taiwanese</b> {{tourists}} were injured after gunmen {{on a motorcycle}} opened fire on a bus parked near gate number three of the mosque. After the attack, the police detained 30 people to question and the area {{was turned into a}} fortress because policemen were heavily deployed.|$|E
5|$|The Fastra II is {{a desktop}} {{supercomputer}} designed for tomography. It {{was built in}} late 2009 by the ASTRA (All Scale Tomographic Reconstruction Antwerp) group of researchers of the IBBT (Interdisciplinary institute for BroadBand Technology) VisionLab at the University of Antwerp and by Belgian computer shop Tones, in collaboration with Asus, a <b>Taiwanese</b> multinational computer product manufacturer, as the successor to the Fastra I (built in 2008).|$|E
5|$|The film's {{world premiere}} {{was at the}} 13th Taipei Film Festival on 25 June 2011, and it was {{subsequently}} released in <b>Taiwanese</b> cinemas on 19 August. Well received by film critics, the movie set box-office records in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Ko Chen-tung won the Best Newcomer award at the Golden Horse Awards {{for his role in}} the film.|$|E
5|$|The mosque {{has been}} the site of two attacks, one in 2006 and another in 2010. During the first, two explosions {{occurred}} in the mosque, injuring thirteen people. In the second, two <b>Taiwanese</b> students were injured as two gunmen opened fire upon them.|$|E
5|$|The bolete {{is found}} from eastern Canada south to Florida and Mississippi, west to Michigan in the United States. The {{distribution}} extends south to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia. It {{is one of}} several boletes that have a north to south clinal trend. In Asia, the species has been reported from India, Korea, China, and Taiwan. <b>Taiwanese</b> specimens tend to have slightly smaller spores (10–16 by 4–5μm) than those from mainland China or from America.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the <b>Taiwanese</b> xiǎochī {{has been}} {{improving}} {{to a higher}} level. Nowadays, <b>Taiwanese</b> xiǎochī not only served in night markets but some luxury and high-end restaurants. The prices usually jump 100% or even higher in the restaurants. Also, the <b>Taiwanese</b> government supports the <b>Taiwanese</b> xiǎochī and has held national xiǎochī events in Taiwan regularly.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} Taiwan is {{a blend of}} Confucianist Han Chinese and <b>Taiwanese</b> aborigines cultures, which are often {{perceived}} in both traditional and modern understandings. The common socio-political experience in Taiwan gradually developed into a sense of <b>Taiwanese</b> cultural identity and a feeling of <b>Taiwanese</b> cultural awareness, which has been widely debated domestically. Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues {{to play a role in}} the conception and development of a <b>Taiwanese</b> cultural identity, especially in the prior dominant frame of a <b>Taiwanese</b> and Chinese dualism. In recent years, the concept of <b>Taiwanese</b> multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of <b>Taiwanese</b> culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the people of Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the {{popularity}} of home video made film-watching a widespread activity for the <b>Taiwanese.</b> However, the <b>Taiwanese</b> film industry faced serious challenges, including the entry of Hong Kong films into the <b>Taiwanese</b> market. In order to compete with Hong Kong films, the CMPC began an initiative to support several fresh, young directors. In 1982, the film In Our Time (1982), which featured four young talented directors (Edward Yang, Te-Chen Tao, I-Chen Ko, and Yi Chang), began what would {{be known as the}} rejuvenation of <b>Taiwanese</b> cinema: the New <b>Taiwanese</b> Cinema.|$|E
