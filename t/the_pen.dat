It is known that the free {{energies}} of <b>the</b> <b>Penner</b> model and <b>the</b> c = 1 noncritical string at self-dual radius agree in a suitable double scaling limit. On the other hand, the instanton in the matrix model describes a nonperturbative effect in the noncritical string theory.

Scheider then performed the scene without <b>the</b> <b>pens</b> actually being present, and <b>the</b> <b>pens</b> were filmed separately against a blue screen using an [...] "Oxberry" [...] animation stand that was programmed to match Scheider's movements.|$|R

5000|$|A quill is a pen {{made from}} a flight feather of a large bird, most often a goose. Quills were used as {{instruments}} for writing with ink before <b>the</b> metal dip <b>pen,</b> <b>the</b> fountain <b>pen,</b> and eventually <b>the</b> ballpoint <b>pen</b> came into use. Quill pens were used in medieval times to write on parchment or paper. The quill eventually replaced <b>the</b> reed <b>pen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A quill pen is {{a writing}} {{implement}} {{made from a}} moulted flight feather (preferably a primary wing-feather) of a large bird. Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of <b>the</b> dip <b>pen,</b> <b>the</b> metal-nibbed <b>pen,</b> <b>the</b> fountain <b>pen,</b> and, eventually, <b>the</b> ballpoint <b>pen.</b> <b>The</b> hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool, because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and wear down the quill very quickly. However, {{it is still the}} tool of choice for a few professionals and provides an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.|$|R

50|$|Using <b>the</b> <b>Penning</b> trap {{can have}} {{advantages}} {{over the radio}} frequency trap (Paul trap). Firstly, in <b>the</b> <b>Penning</b> trap only static fields are applied and therefore there is no micro-motion and resultant heating of the ions due to the dynamic fields, even for extended 2- and 3-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals. Also, <b>the</b> <b>Penning</b> trap can be made larger whilst maintaining strong trapping. The trapped ion can then be held further away from the electrode surfaces. Interaction with patch potentials on the electrode surfaces can be responsible for heating and decoherence effects and these effects scale as a high power of the inverse distance between the ion and the electrode.|$|R

5|$|Agârbiceanu {{recalled}} {{an idyllic}} childhood, with summers spent tending to his father's sheep and {{sleeping in a}} stick hut. An avid reader of stories by Petre Ispirescu, he attended school in his native village and in Blaj, graduating from the Superior Gymnasium in 1900. Literary historians describe this as the period of his literary debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Agârbiceanu published a feuilleton (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, the short story În postul Paștelui ("At Lent"). Agârbiceanu also served {{as secretary of the}} Blaj Literary Society, at the time the city's only Romanian-speaking literary body still tolerated by the Hungarian authorities.
