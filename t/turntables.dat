40|$|The <b>turntable</b> {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the evolution of 20 th century Western music, both as a recording/playback device, and as a musical instrument in its own right. The focus of this thesis is my original compositions that feature the <b>turntable</b> and the history of the <b>turntable</b> as a musical instrument. The 20 th century delivered significant progress in <b>turntable</b> technology, but produced limited innovation for the <b>turntable</b> in new music composition. Except for a few outliers, the same techniques for the <b>turntable</b> have been recycled among experimental composers, sound artists and pop music producers since the 1930 ’s. This thesis embraces those techniques from the past, and moves forward to explore new potential for the <b>turntable.</b> My original folio of work featuring the <b>turntable</b> is informed by my research into: (1) conceptual barriers to understanding the <b>turntable</b> as an instrument (2) <b>turntable</b> notation (3) amplification options (4) public opinion of the <b>turntable</b> in the concert hall (5) original <b>turntable</b> techniques as well as my adaptation of existing techniques (6) composers who embraced the turntable-as-instrument...|$|R

5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short <b>turntables.</b>|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by award-winning composer Christopher Lennertz, with music contributed by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, Stefan Lessard of Dave Matthews Band and Money Mark—a collaborator with the Beastie Boys. McCready, Lessard, and Mark worked with musicians Matt Chamberlain, David Levita, Aaron Kaplan, Victor Indrizzo, Chris Chaney, Davey Chegwidden and DJ Cheapshot {{to develop the}} music.

5|$|Further {{construction}} of the line was limited {{by a lack of}} funds. Russell asked the LNWR to adopt the line in August 1865, to no avail. An Act of 1866 gave permission to raise a further £20,000, with loans of £6,600. After raising this capital, the line was opened to Llanerchymedd in 1866, with the temporary station at Llangefni replaced by a permanent structure half a mile further on. Captain Rich, when surveying the line, noted that the curves and gradients were severe, and recommended that the line be worked at moderate speed. He also noted the lack of <b>turntables,</b> and the company's intention to use Fairlie engines on the line.|$|E

5|$|Tobin began {{performing}} live {{shows in}} clubs with other Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album, Bricolage. His shows generally contained music {{that he had}} produced during his career, mixed with modified songs from drum and bass, hip-hop, or other genres. Because his music was entirely produced in a studio with electronics, Tobin {{was not interested in}} adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians. He instead used <b>turntables</b> which he felt had more in common with his approach to music production. He is known for building Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{is home to}} two {{pioneers in}} {{undergraduate}} campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, {{claims to be the}} oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and <b>turntables</b> when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room. The station has its studios {{on the second floor of}} Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest Student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.|$|E

Slipknot reached number 51 on the US Billboard 200, {{and has since}} been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band followed this up in 2001 with Iowa, which reached number 3 on the Billboard 200 and topped the UK Albums Chart. Slipknot also released its first two videos during this period – Welcome to Our Neighborhood, a collection of music videos and live footage, in 1999, and Disasterpieces, a live concert recorded in London, England, in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Green Day {{began the}} {{recording}} process for 21st Century Breakdown in January 2008. Later that year, it was {{confirmed that the}} band worked with producer Butch Vig. The album was recorded with Vig throughout 2008 and into early 2009 at four locations in California: Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, Studio 880 in Oakland, Jel Studios in Newport Beach, and Costa Mesa Studios in Costa Mesa. While recording in Hollywood, the band members bought cheap <b>turntables</b> from Amoeba Music and listened to many vinyl records for inspiration, including albums by The Beat and The Plimsouls. Armstrong cited as inspiration the music of The Kinks' Ray Davies, The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow, The Doors' The Doors and Strange Days, and Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell. Drummer Tré Cool noted the influence of Eddie Cochran and The Creation on Armstrong's writing.|$|E
5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the <b>turntables</b> are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E

5|$|The SR V class, more {{commonly}} known as the Schools class, is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway. The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell's LSWR/SR King Arthur class. It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and was the most powerful class of 4-4-0 ever produced in Europe. All 40 of the class were named after English public schools, and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi-fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short <b>turntables.</b> Because of the use of a ‘’King Arthur’’ firebox, rather than the square-topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons, the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line. The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years. The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962. Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Turntables</b> allow DJs to play vinyl records. By {{adjusting}} the playback {{speed of the}} turntable, either by {{adjusting the}} speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the tempos of different records so their rhythms can be played together {{at the same time}} without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as beatmatching. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on <b>turntables</b> that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a slipmat that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. Direct-drive <b>turntables</b> are the type preferred by DJs, with the Technics SL-1200 being the most popular model of <b>turntables</b> for DJs. Belt-drive <b>turntables</b> are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play hip hop music, go beyond merely mixing records and use <b>turntables</b> as musical instruments for scratching, beat juggling, and other turntablism techniques.|$|E
