40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} maximizing the long-run average reward in a service facility with dynamic pricing. We investigate sensitivity of optimal pricing policies for <b>the</b> service <b>facility</b> which is modelled as an M/M/s/K queueing system. Arrival process to <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> is Poisson with arrival rate a decreasing function of the price currently being charged in <b>the</b> <b>facility.</b> We prove some structural results on the optimal pricing policies when the parameters in <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> change. Namely, we show that optimal prices decrease when the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> and/or <b>the</b> number of servers in <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> increase. Under a reasonable assumption, we also show that optimal prices increase as the overall demand for the service provided by <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> increases and/or when the service rate of <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> decreases. We illustrate how these structural results simplify the required computational effort while finding the optimal policy...|$|R
