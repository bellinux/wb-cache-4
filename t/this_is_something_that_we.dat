60|$|If I {{spoke with}} Altrurian {{breadth of the}} way New-Yorkers live, my dear Cyril, I should begin {{by saying that the}} New-Yorkers did not live at all. But outside of our happy country one learns to distinguish, and to allow that there are several degrees of living, all indeed hateful to us, if we knew them, and yet none without some saving grace in it. You would say that in {{conditions}} where men were embattled against one another by the greed and the envy and the ambition which these conditions perpetually appeal to here, there could be no grace in life; but we must remember that men have always been better than their conditions, and that otherwise they would have remained savages without the instinct or the wish to advance. Indeed, our own state is testimony of a potential civility in all states, which we must keep in mind when we judge the peoples of the plutocratic world, and especially the American people, who are above all others the devotees and exemplars of the plutocratic ideal, without limitation by any aristocracy, theocracy, or monarchy. They are purely commercial, and the thing that cannot be bought and sold has logically no place in their life. But life is not logical outside of Altruria; we are the only people in the world, my dear Cyril, who are privileged to live reasonably; and again I say we must put by our own criterions if we wish to understand the Americans, or to recognize that measure of loveliness which their warped and stunted and perverted lives certainly show, in spite of theory and in spite of conscience, even. I can make this clear to you, I think, by a single instance, say that of the American who sees a case of distress, and longs to relieve it. If he is rich, he can give relief with a good conscience, except for the harm that may come to his beneficiary from being helped; but if he is not rich, or not finally rich, and especially if he has a family dependent upon him, he cannot give in anything like the measure Christ bade us give without wronging those dear to him, immediately or remotely. That is to say, in conditions which oblige every man to look out for himself, a man cannot be a Christian without remorse; he cannot do a generous action without self-reproach; he cannot be nobly unselfish without the fear of being a fool. You would think that this predicament must deprave, and so without doubt it does; and yet it is not wholly depraving. It often has its effect in character of a rare and pathetic sublimity; and many Americans take all the cruel risks of doing good, reckless of the evil that may befall them, and defiant of the upbraidings of their own hearts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> Altrurians can scarcely understand: it is like the munificence of a savage who has killed a deer and shares it with his starving tribesmen, forgetful of the hungering little ones who wait his return from the chase with food; for life in plutocratic countries is still a chase, and the game is wary and sparse, as the terrible average of failures witnesses.|$|E

"A {{few years}} ago we decided to make this project on the {{assassination}} of Rabin {{as a kind of}} a gesture about memory and even in the hope that sometimes when you resurrect memory, it can create movements. But we have to be modest about it: art is not {{the most efficient way to}} change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects.

The work culture at Naughty Dog is very different to many other studios; there is less middle-management; the studio's lead effects artist, Keith Guerrette, said: [...] "It comes with a lot of pros and cons but I think it definitely is one of our biggest strengths. Looking around at the rest of the industry, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do talk about quite a bit, the companies that are doing really innovative, cool things are all the ones that don't have the management, like the business side, directly injected into the company. Sony's put us in this fantastic situation where we don't have any producers; we don't have any interactions with Sony corporate at all on the development." [...] Naughty Dog has also complete freedom in basically every aspect of game design, and that also means that Sony Computer Entertainment, the parent company, doesn't prevent the studio from any implementation of game elements.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that the Counter Strike: Source team from EFGaming was drafted to participate in the first season of the Championship Gaming Series, as the season has unfolded it is clear that they not only deserved the chance to play in the league but they are one of the top teams that compete on that level. When the team left EFGaming to pursue this venture {{there were a lot of}} questions as to what direction the management of EFGaming would take for the future. John [...] "Brex" [...] Atwell and myself have had several discussions over the past few weeks as to what our direction should be, and we have come to our decisions.We have been approached by several teams, and individuals in regards to taking over where our last team left off, and although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may do in the future, it isn't an offer we're willing to extend to anyone at this point. Our last team won each and every tournament that they attended under the EFGaming name, and those are hard shoes for anyone to fill. Due to that, as well as some other personal interest on our behalf, we have decided to not bring another team or division to EFGaming at this time. As for John and myself, we will still be in and around the community as we look for our next potential challenge. From the start this has been about a love for the game itself, and we feel confident that the right situation will present itself to us at some point in the future. It may not be under the EFGaming name however when we find the right situation for us, the EFGaming management team will once again try to develop another top team or organization.|$|E

5000|$|The British {{historian}} Richard J. Evans credited What Is History? with {{causing a}} revolution in British historiography in the 1960s. The Australian historian Keith Windschuttle, a critic of Carr noted regretfully that What Is History? {{has proved to be}} one of the most influential books ever written about historiography, and that there were very few historians working in the English language since the 1960s who had not read What Is History? Against Carr's theory of [...] "facts of the past" [...] and [...] "facts of history", Winschuttle wrote:"Another contender for historical truth might be the proposition: 'The United States defeated Japan in the Second World War.' Now <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know not simply from the historical record. It is no mere interpretation derived from an examination of the documents of surrender signed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Harbour in 1945. It is not an interpretation that future generations might overturn after they have scoured the nuances of the texts for so far undiscerned ideological meaning. The fact that the United States defeated Japan has shaped the very world that all of us have inhabited since 1945. The relations between states, the world economy, the employment market of every industrial country are all consequences in various ways of this historical truth. The world itself confirms the proposition.Of course, E.H. Carr might argue the defeat of Japan is a mere 'fact' and the really interesting discussions are the interpretations historians make and the conclusions they draw from facts of this kind. Well, one man's fact can be another man's conclusion. For someone writing a narrative history of the war in the Pacific, the defeat of Japan is a very big conclusion indeed. There is no event that is inherently confined to the status of a mere fact, that is, a building block of a much larger conclusion. Every fact can itself be a conclusion and every conclusion can itself be a fact in someone else's explanation." ...|$|E
