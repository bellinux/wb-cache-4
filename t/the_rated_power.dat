2500|$|Wirewound {{resistors}} {{are commonly}} made by winding a metal wire, usually nichrome, around a ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core. The {{ends of the}} wire are soldered or welded to two caps or rings, attached {{to the ends of}} the core. The assembly is protected with a layer of paint, molded plastic, or an enamel coating baked at high temperature. These resistors are designed to withstand unusually high temperatures of up to 450°C. Wire leads in low power wirewound resistors are usually between 0.6 and 0.8mm in diameter and tinned for ease of soldering. For higher power wirewound resistors, either a ceramic outer case or an aluminum outer case on top of an insulating layer is used – if the outer case is ceramic, such resistors are sometimes described as [...] "cement" [...] resistors, though they do not actually contain any traditional cement. The aluminum-cased types are designed to be attached to a heat sink to dissipate the heat; <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> is dependent on being used with a suitable heat sink, e.g., a 50 W power rated resistor overheats at a fraction of the power dissipation if not used with a heat sink. Large wirewound resistors may be rated for 1,000 watts or more.|$|E

50|$|Because {{few have}} the {{capability}} to actually blueprint, and because of the monetary incentive of claiming one has performed the work, many people have come to believe blueprinting only means that all the specifications are double-checked. Serious efforts at blueprinting result in better-than-factory tolerances, possibly with custom specifications appropriate for the application. Common goals include engine re-manufacturing to achieve <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> for its manufacturer's design (because not all mass-production engines put out <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power),</b> and to rebuild the engine to make more power from a given design than otherwise intended (because custom engines can often be redesigned to different specifications). Blueprinted components allow for a more exact balancing of reciprocating parts and rotating assemblies so that less power is lost through excessive engine vibrations and other mechanical inefficiencies.|$|E
