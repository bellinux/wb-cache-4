5|$|When a storm begins, {{the crew}} start to set sail. Toby drops a {{polished}} crown while bringing his father a coat. <b>The</b> <b>Siren</b> is summoned and takes Toby. Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing the victims are not dead, the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible {{in the same spot}} the pirate ship is located.|$|E
5|$|Surmising <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> {{is using}} {{water as a}} portal, the Doctor instructs {{everyone}} to seek refuge in the ship's dry magazine. There, they find Toby Avery (Oscar Lloyd), {{the son of the}} ship's captain Henry Avery (Hugh Bonneville), who stowed away on the ship in order to join the crew after his mother died, unaware of his father's illicit deeds. He too has a black spot on his palm due to a fever. In an attempt to escape, the Doctor and Avery board the TARDIS, but find it is acting haphazardly, and are forced to evacuate, and they watch as it dematerializes by itself. After another shipmate is taken by <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> in a dry room, the Doctor realizes <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> is using reflection to appear. In response they rid the ship of reflective surfaces, including the ship's stolen treasure.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds the}} spaceship's crew long dead from {{exposure}} to a human virus. The trio then discover a sickbay where Avery's entire crew, Toby, and Rory are in medical care along with the TARDIS. <b>The</b> <b>Siren</b> {{turns out to be}} the ship's virtual doctor, caring for the injured humans; the black spots are tissue samples used as references. Amy convinces <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and his crew, unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and his crew, sets off to explore the stars.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> {{had another}} {{successful}} year for <b>the</b> <b>Sirens,</b> as they finished 6-2 to win another division title and defeat the Portland Shockwave in the Western Conference Semifinal. However, one week later, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> lost <b>the</b> Western Conference Championship to the Detroit Demolition by {{a score of}} 50-32, marking {{the first time in}} five years that <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> did not win their league's championship.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> {{returned}} to their winning ways, finishing 5-3. However, that was still not enough for <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> {{to return to the}} playoffs.|$|R
50|$|In another myth, Hera, {{queen of}} the gods, persuaded <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> to enter a singing contest with the Muses, which <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> lost; out of their anguish, writes Stephanus of Byzantium, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera ("featherless"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Souda (modern Lefkai).|$|R
5|$|In Batman '66 #2, Kathy Kane is Bruce's Wayne's date to {{a concert}} by Chandell. She later rescues Batman from an attack by <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> that causes him to {{experience}} a series of bizarre hallucinations. During the hallucinations Batman briefly sees Kathy as a woman wearing the Silver Age Batwoman costume.|$|E
5|$|The {{speakers}} {{for modern}} sirens can be {{integral to the}} lightbar, {{or they may be}} hidden in or flush to the grill to reduce noise inside the ambulance that may interfere with patient care and radio communications. Ambulances can additionally be fitted with airhorn audible warnings to augment the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
50|$|Joining {{a larger}} league in 2003, the Independent Women's Football League (IWFL), <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> {{traveled}} to New York to capture their second consecutive championship title, beating the New York Sharks. In 2004 Sacramento hosted the IWFL National Championship game where <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> defeated their New York rival again. A year later, in Manchester, New Hampshire, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> defeated <b>the</b> Atlanta Xplosion in the 2005 IWFL national championship.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Lorelei Signal", a 1973 {{episode of}} Star Trek: The Animated Series, Uhura takes {{control of the}} ship when the male {{officers}} fall victim to a species of sirens and leads an all-female rescue party. After <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> are defeated, <b>the</b> Enterprise helps <b>the</b> <b>sirens,</b> and Uhura bonds with <b>the</b> <b>sirens,</b> who are happy {{at the thought that}} they might meet men and have children.|$|R
50|$|Achelois was a surname of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens,</b> <b>the</b> {{daughters of}} Achelous.|$|R
5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The longer {{version of}} The Last Road to Hell {{is no longer}} found in the film's negatives, but it was {{included}} in the original Dutch Ultrabit DVD release by EC Entertainment in 1999. This digital version has since been re-released and licensed for other various DVD releases in Europe. The Grindhouse Releasing DVD release in the United States and <b>the</b> <b>Siren</b> Visual release in Australia have the shorter version of The Last Road to Hell within the feature film but include the extended version in the special features on the first disc.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. <b>The</b> <b>siren</b> caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E
5000|$|... 1,078 {{electronic}} warning sirens {{are installed}} in Denmark. <b>The</b> <b>sirens</b> {{are placed on}} the top of buildings or on masts. This warning system makes it possible to warn the population in all urban areas with more than 1,000 inhabitants. This means that about 80% of Denmark's population can be warned by means of <b>the</b> stationary <b>sirens.</b> <b>The</b> remaining 20% will be warned by mobile sirens mounted on police cars. The function of <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> is tested every night, without producing any sound. Once every year, on the first Wednesday of May at 12:00, <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> will be tested with sound.|$|R

50|$|When Rio was Above, Maire {{told her}} how to escape. <b>The</b> <b>sirens</b> sang in harmony. <b>The</b> <b>sirens</b> were shot down one by one. Maire gave Rio a seashell with her mother’s voice, and gestured for her and True to escape.|$|R
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by <b>the</b> <b>Siren.</b> The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E
25|$|Camberley {{falls under}} <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> test area of Broadmoor Hospital, a secure mental {{hospital}} in nearby Crowthorne. <b>The</b> <b>siren</b> was installed following a public outcry at the escape of child-murderer John Thomas Straffen in April 1952. <b>The</b> <b>siren</b> is still tested every Monday at 10am.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, Starbucks {{announced}} that they would make small changes to the company's logo, removing the Starbucks wordmark around <b>the</b> <b>siren,</b> enlarging <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> image, and making it green.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, {{their first}} year of existence, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> won <b>the</b> divisional title and {{advanced}} to the playoffs of the Women's American Football League.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sirens.</b> First {{you will}} come to <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> who enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens,</b> his wife and {{children}} will never welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them. Homer, The Odyssey, XII, 52ff.|$|R

25|$|At this point, the Fremantle players {{began to}} {{celebrate}} {{what they thought}} was a one-point victory. Nicholls, however, did not hear <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> and refused to listen to the claims of Fremantle players, particularly Byron Schammer, that <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> had sounded. He also did not confer with the other two umpires as to whether <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> had sounded before restarting play.|$|E
25|$|Nick Riewoldt (St Kilda) {{knocked the}} ball across the field, and another pack formed as the {{official}} timekeeper's clock reached 0:00. (The timekeeper's clock is displayed on the television broadcast.) The umpire controlling play, Matthew Nicholls, signalled another ball-up to restart play; he was oblivious to the noise of <b>the</b> <b>siren,</b> which was barely audible over the raucous crowd. A number of Fremantle players, particularly Scott Thornton, appeared to have either heard <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> or reacted to other players hearing <b>the</b> <b>siren.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 1982 VFA {{match between}} Frankston and Geelong West ended in similar circumstances. The {{controlling}} umpire failed to hear <b>the</b> <b>siren,</b> allowing Geelong West's Simon Taylor {{to kick the}} winning goal after time expired, while the non-controlling umpire heard <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> and signalled the end of play; the two umpires conferred and awarded the goal. Frankston appealed the result, but the appeal was rejected. As in the St Kilda vs Fremantle match, the Association found that the timekeeper should have sounded <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> for longer.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> {{finished}} 7-1, winning another {{division title}} and defeating the Seattle Majestics in the semifinal round. As {{they had done}} the year before, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> would lose <b>the</b> conference championship again to the Detroit Demolition, this time by a score of 49-0.|$|R
40|$|Eugène Goblet d’Alviella Prize of the Royal Academy of Belgium (2016) Is {{the harmony}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> in Plato’s Myth of Er derived from Early Pythagorean {{doctrine}} {{or is the}} doctrine, which in Iamblichus’ On the Pythagorean Way of Life, defines the harmony of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> as being <b>the</b> tetractys and the oracle at Delphi, a Pseudo-pythagorean invention drawing upon this famous passage in Plato’s Republic? What does the harmony of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> mean for <b>the</b> Pythagoreans {{and what does it}} mean for Plato? Does the Platonic image of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> do any philosophical work within the context of the Republic? What is the connection, if any, between the Platonic and Pythagorean themes of the harmony of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens,</b> on one hand, and the song of <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> in Homer’s Odyssey, on the other? By investigating these and other relevant questions, Irini-Fotini Viltanioti offers, for the first time, a sustained study of the mythological rendition of the famous Pythagorean theory of the so-called “Harmony of the Spheres” in Plato’s Republic and in Iamblichus’ On the Pythagorean Way of Life. Filling this serious gap in current literature, this book is an important contribution to the field of Pythagorean and Platonic studies. nrpages: 262 status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|The 1980 Night Grand Final between North Melbourne and Collingwood at VFL Park {{ended in}} similar circumstances: <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> sounded, but the umpires {{were unable to}} hear it. In the ensuing play, North Melbourne's Kerry Good marked and goaled after <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> {{to win the game}} for North Melbourne by three points. Collingwood did not appeal, and the result stands as official.|$|E
25|$|Electric-motor-driven {{mechanical}} sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 volts (DC) when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate {{wiring and}} transient protection for engine control computers {{is a necessary}} part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the wiring to the vehicle engine starter motor. Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an electric brake, a solenoid that presses a friction pad against <b>the</b> <b>siren</b> rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop <b>the</b> <b>siren.</b>|$|E

50|$|But in 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Sirens</b> had an undeniably most disappointing season yet.

50|$|Singapore {{currently}} has {{a network of}} over 2,000 stationary <b>sirens</b> named <b>the</b> Public Warning System which warns the entire country of war air raids, man-made and natural disasters (except earth tremors). On {{the first day of}} every month Singapore's sirens are tested. During <b>the</b> test, <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> sounds a light but cheerful chime instead of any of its three signals, which led to the population's speculations of <b>the</b> <b>sirens</b> reminding them of the start of each month. <b>The</b> <b>sirens</b> look very similar to the ECN3000 Israel version pictured on the upper right.|$|R
