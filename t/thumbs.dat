5|$|Opposable <b>thumbs</b> {{allowing}} the grasping of objects {{are most often}} associated with primates, like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs. Opposable <b>thumbs</b> also evolved in pandas, but these are completely different in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the <b>thumbs</b> and big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad <b>thumbs</b> and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, adult males {{of the species}} were characterized by greatly enlarged upper arms (humerus) with a bony ridge covered by skin and black keratinized spines. Spines were also present on the upper surface of the area just before the <b>thumbs.</b> These spines were likely used during amplexus.|$|E
50|$|In {{territories of}} the Qing dynasty, Manchurian {{cylindrical}} <b>thumb</b> rings gradually displaced more <b>thumb</b> pad shaped <b>thumb</b> rings. These cylindrical <b>thumb</b> rings would {{go over the}} primary <b>thumb</b> joint, hooking the draw string {{around the base of}} the cylinder.|$|R

5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the <b>thumbs</b> and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the <b>thumbs</b> and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{constellation}} of anomalies seen with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{result in a}} distinct diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria for the disorder are broad distal phalanges of the <b>thumbs</b> and big toes, accompanied by a broad and shortened nose, sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay, with predominant occurrence in males.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} truce term {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by a gesture, such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of <b>thumbs.</b> In the US a T-shape made with both hands (representing time-out) has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.|$|E
40|$|Traumatic <b>thumb</b> defects {{significantly}} affect the function and {{appearance of the}} hand; thus, <b>thumb</b> reconstruction {{is very important in}} clinical practice. In our report, three reconstruction strategies of toe-to-thumb transplantation, based on the amputation level of the <b>thumb,</b> were used for immediate <b>thumb</b> reconstruction in 27 patients with traumatic <b>thumb</b> defects. All procedures were performed successfully. Patients were satisfied with the function and appearance of the reconstructed <b>thumb.</b> These results indicate that if the reconstruction method is properly selected based on the amputation level of the <b>thumb,</b> toe-to-thumb transplantation is feasible for the immediate reconstruction of the <b>thumb...</b>|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, a tight <b>thumb</b> web space (the {{area between}} <b>thumb</b> and index finger) can {{contribute}} to congenital clasped <b>thumb.</b> The <b>thumb</b> cannot be properly abducted (moved outwards), if the web space is too tight.|$|R

5|$|The {{game is a}} non-direct {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone (2008) and {{features}} the same main character—an unnamed spy. It was developed {{as part of the}} Kickstarter campaign for the revival of the Idle <b>Thumbs</b> podcast and included a free copy of its predecessor. Thirty Flights of Loving received generally favorable reviews from video game media outlets, scoring 88 out of 100 on aggregate website Metacritic. A follow-up, Quadrilateral Cowboy, was released on July 25, 2016.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to the Idle <b>Thumbs</b> podcast revival Kickstarter. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included Gravity Bone as an additional feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, {{this is not the}} case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or <b>thumbs.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Thumb</b> {{polydactyly}} {{is reported}} to be the most common congenital anomaly of the hand in Japan. The floating type is not particularly rare, accounting for 0. 9 to 15 % of all cases of <b>thumb</b> polydactyly. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there has been only one case of <b>thumb</b> polydactyly with a floating ulnar <b>thumb,</b> reported by Onizuka. Herein, we report a case very similar to that reported by Onizuka. In our case, the vessels feeding the floating ulnar <b>thumb</b> branched from the superficial palmar arterial arch, and X-rays revealed triphalangism. In surgery, we not only reconstructed the morphology of the <b>thumb,</b> but also tried to preserve the sensation in the reconstructed <b>thumb</b> by transposing the digital nerve of the floating ulnar <b>thumb</b> to the radial <b>thumb.</b> In addition to <b>thumb</b> polydactyly, our case also showed hypoplasia of the thenar muscles...|$|R

30|$|We {{presented}} a sixth finger system composed of an extra robotic <b>thumb</b> {{attached to the}} left hand, that simulates a second <b>thumb</b> in that hand and has a force sensor in its tip; a <b>thumb</b> motion capture, that attaches to the right hand, and captures the movements and position of {{the tip of the}} <b>thumb</b> in that hand, to mirror its movements into the extra robotic <b>thumb.</b> And a electrostimulation device that provides pseudo tactile feedback from the force sensor on the tip of the robotic <b>thumb</b> to the tip of the right <b>thumb.</b>|$|R
5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his <b>thumbs</b> to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving {{includes}} {{references and}} Easter eggs, as did Gravity Bone. Films such as Three Days of the Condor and The Conversation, film directors Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino, games such as Zork and , and animated shows like Animaniacs and TaleSpin are referenced in the campaign. Unlike most of Chung's previous games, Thirty Flights of Loving was not framed around a certain musical composition. It incorporates music composed by Idle <b>Thumbs</b> member Chris Remo, while additional audio {{was provided by}} Jared Emerson-Johnson and A.J. Locascio. It makes use of Soundsnap's sound library.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving is a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} developed by Brendon Chung's indie video game studio, Blendo Games.

The game employs {{a modified version of}} id Software's 1997-era id Tech 2 engine—originally used for Quake 2—and incorporates music composed by Idle <b>Thumbs</b> member Chris Remo. It follows three people as they prepare for an alcohol heist and the aftermath of the operation.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Thumb</b> Around is {{performed}} by pushing a pen using any finger (usually the middle finger if done in isolation) except the <b>thumb</b> {{to initiate the}} pen to spin around the <b>thumb</b> one time, then catching it between the <b>thumb</b> and a finger. Before the pen spinning community became significantly organized, the <b>Thumb</b> Around Normal was known by a multitude of names, including 360 Degree Normal, Forward, Normal, and <b>Thumb</b> Spin (now {{the name of a}} separate trick).|$|R
5000|$|... "Clubbed thumb" [...] , stub <b>thumb,</b> potter's <b>thumb,</b> bohemian <b>thumb,</b> royal <b>thumb,</b> or murderer's <b>thumb</b> are {{historically}} colloquial names likely {{associated with}} the genetic trait known as brachydactyly type D or BDD. [...] BDD is the classification of a skeletal formation found in one or both hands marked by an abnormally short and round <b>thumb</b> with an accompanying short and wide nail bed. BDD exhibits autosomal dominance and is developed or inherited independently of other hereditary traits.|$|R
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their <b>thumbs</b> are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Tina in a dream, Rahul and {{his family}} go to Anjali's wedding, where Rahul silently confesses to Anjali that he loves her, and watches in tears as she is brought forth for the wedding. Realising this, Anjali is {{hesitant}} {{to go on with}} the marriage, and stands weeping. Aman notices the tears in her eyes and realises that she has always been in love with Rahul. He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul. Rahul and Anjali have an emotional hug and as the two marry, little Anjali Khanna sees a vision of Tina, who is smiling and giving her the <b>thumbs</b> up. Rahul and Anjali Sharma get married.|$|E
5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and <b>thumbs.</b> He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
50|$|Green <b>Thumb</b> Theatre (also {{known as}} the Green <b>Thumb</b> Theatre for Young People and simply as Green <b>Thumb)</b> is a Canadian children's theatre company based in Vancouver, British Columbia that was founded in 1975.

English Canadian Ken Peirson was the manager of Green <b>Thumb</b> from 1982 to 1985. In 1982, Green <b>Thumb</b> produced Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a sexual abuse prevention program. Green <b>Thumb</b> performed the premiere of Colin Thomas' play One Thousand Cranes in 1983. Morris Panych has written several plays for the company that have toured internationally. Green <b>Thumb's</b> Celestial Being received the 2015 Jessie Richardson Theatre Award for outstanding production for young audiences. Also that year, Green <b>Thumb</b> performed George F.

The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported {{that the cause of}} the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The <b>thumbs</b> were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
