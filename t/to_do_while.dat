5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated over what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>while</b> William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative. Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>while</b> with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E

5|$|In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut {{for a large}} invited audience; it was {{remarked that}} his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his {{personal}} bearing was admirable {{for a man of}} eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the Cimetière de Montparnasse. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Simović named Maček as Deputy Prime Minister {{once again}} in the new government, but Maček was {{reluctant}} and remained in Zagreb while he decided what <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, he decided that he needed to show HSS support for the new government and that joining it was necessary. On 4 April he travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post, on several conditions; that the new government respect the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia in some respects, that the new government respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents. That same day exiled Croatian politician and Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić called for Croats to start an uprising against the government over his Radio Velebit program based in Italy.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E

Sarfraz Ahmed gave the selectors a long thought but the board finally decided to go in favor of Azhar Ali who hadn't played ODI cricket for almost 2 years {{at the time of}} his appointment. While this decision was opposed by many, Azhar Ali seemed determined to take the Pakistani team right on top.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} eSports in South Korea {{is thought to}} have been {{influenced}} by the mass building of broadband internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for things <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>while</b> out of work. Instrumental to this growth of eSports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate eSports in the country.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 2010, President Obama {{announced}} that he would nominate Petraeus to succeed General Stanley A. McChrystal as the commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. The change of command was prompted by McChrystal's comments about the Obama administration and its policies in Afghanistan during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. The nomination was technically a positional step down from his position as commander of Central Command, however the President said that he believed that he was the best man for the job. After being confirmed by the Senate on June 30, Petraeus formally assumed command on July 4. During the assumption of command remarks, Petraeus provided his vision and goals to NATO, the members of his command, and his Afghan partners. As he was known <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>while</b> the Commander in Iraq, Petraeus delivered his first Letter to the Troops on the same day he assumed command.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe. For example, girls learn how to make doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having little boys follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>while</b> hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn the same way. They watch the women of the society do their daily routines and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. Having a little girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1978, {{councillor}} John Sewell, {{an airport}} opponent, won the Toronto mayoral election. During his mayoralty, another firm Canavia Transit of Montreal, proposed {{to set up}} a STOL service using Dash 7 planes and build a tunnel to the airport. Canavia's application to the Canadian Transport Commission (CTC) did not require Toronto approval, but Sewell and Council made its opposition clear to the Government of Canada, asking that it block the application, which it refused <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> the City of Toronto opposed the STOL plan on concerns about noise and the environment, and doubted its economic feasibility, the Government of Ontario supported the proposal. Toronto MPP David Stollery, member for Toronto-Spadina, also came out against the airport, suggesting the STOL service be set up at Downsview Airport, which was situated {{at the end of the}} Yonge-University-Spadina subway line. Former councillor David Paul Smith, whom Sewell had defeated in the 1978, organized a lobbying campaign, supported by deHavilland and the Board of Trade, to convince Metro Toronto Council to support the STOL plan.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Christopher Neff, {{a policy}} analyst at the University of Sydney, argues that terms like [...] "attack" [...] are laden with {{cultural}} stigmatization. Instead of the word [...] "attack", he proposes labeling human-shark interactions, {{on a scale of}} extremity, as encounters, minor bites, moderate bites and fatal bites. The term [...] "attack" [...] is only appropriate in specific instances where specialists can confirm the predatory nature of the shark-human encounter, which is extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> many encounters with oceanic whitetip sharks appear predatory in nature, without the verification of a scientific community in each instance, it is best to assume the accidental or nonpredatory intent of the encounters.|$|E

[...] He changes his mind at the last minute; but cannot get out when his seat belt jams. Alex manages to save Carter when his seat belt rips, just before his car is smashed by an oncoming train. As Billy warns the others {{to stay away from}} Carter he is suddenly decapitated by flying shrapnel from the car wreckage.|$|E
500|$|McCain recuperated {{just enough}} to pass his flight {{physical}} and have his flight status reinstated. In August 1974, {{he was assigned to}} the Replacement Air Group VA-174 [...] "Hellrazors". This was an A-7 Corsair II training squadron located at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Jacksonville and the largest aviation squadron in the Navy. He became its executive officer in 1975, and on July 1, 1976, he was made VA-174's commanding officer. [...] This last assignment was controversial, as {{he did not have the}} required experience of having commanded a smaller squadron first (something that he now had too high a rank <b>to</b> <b>do).</b> <b>While</b> some senior officers resented McCain's presence as favoritism due to his father, junior officers rallied to him and helped him qualify for A-7 carrier landings.|$|E

500|$|The Gentlemen, {{called the}} [...] "creepiest villains we've ever done" [...] by series writer Doug Petrie, were {{inspired}} by a nightmare Whedon had as a child, specifically {{one in which he}} was in bed and approached by a floating monster. Whedon fashioned The Gentlemen as something from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, intending them to be frightening to children — monsters who carve out people's hearts, smiling as they do so. Nosferatu, Pinhead from Hellraiser, and Mr. Burns from The Simpsons all served as physical models for The Gentlemen. Elegantly Victorian in costume and demeanor, Whedon found their politeness and grace especially unsettling. Their metallic teeth {{were inspired by}} the intersection of Victorian culture with the height of the Industrial age, an era that Whedon considers [...] "classically creepy". For Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox, The Gentlemen and their straitjacket-wearing minions, who clumsily flap, gyrate, and crouch as they move, are representative of class disparity and patriarchy: The Gentlemen, with their Victorian suits, move effortlessly to accomplish what they set out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>while</b> their minions, whom Whedon called [...] "footmen", do the [...] "dirty work".|$|E
500|$|Some {{parts of}} the episode {{consisted}} of a mixture of written dialogue and comedic improvisation from the actors. In one such scene, Aziz Ansari attempts to flirt with Rashida Jones when she speaks at a Parks and Recreation public forum. The scene {{was included in the}} script, but Ansari continued to improvise long after his dialogue ended, and Jones said she found it difficult to keep a straight face during filming. Schur encouraged Ansari to continue, and suggested the line in which Ansari asks to go away with Jones for the weekend. Daniels called the scene [...] "probably the highlight of the pilot." [...] The ending included another example of written dialogue mixed with improvisation, when Ansari recited a list of unusual things Leslie has attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>while</b> drunk. In other scenes, the written dialogue was abandoned altogether in favor of improvisation, such as the scene of Ann and Andy talking on Ann's couch after Leslie fell into the pit and injured herself. Chris Pratt improvised a number of other lines and scenes in the episode, including when Andy asked Leslie to pass him his [...] "itch stick", which he then used to scratch under his leg cast in an awkward and disgusting way.|$|E
500|$|Chancellor Wang Anshi, also {{a renowned}} prose stylist, wrote a work {{on matters of}} state justice in the 11th century. Wang wrote that private interests, {{especially}} of those seeking vigilante justice, should in almost all circumstances never trump or interfere with public justice. In the ancient Classic of Rites, Rites of Zhou, and [...] "Gongyang" [...] commentary of the Spring and Autumn Annals, seeking vengeance for a violent crime against one's family {{is viewed as a}} moral and filial obligation, although in the Rites of Zhou state intervention between the instigating and avenging parties was emphasized. Wang believed that the state of Song China was far more stable than those in ancient times and abler to dispense fair justice. Although Wang praised the classic avenger Wu Zixu (526–484 BC), Michael Dalby writes that Wang [...] "would have been filled with horror if Wu's deeds, so outdated in their political implications, had been repeated in Song times." [...] For Wang, a victim exacting personal revenge against one who committed an egregious criminal act should only be considered acceptable when the government and its legal system became dysfunctional, chaotic, or ceased to exist. In his view, the hallmark of a properly functioning government was one where an innocent man was never executed. If this were to occur, his or her grieving relatives, friends, and associates should voice complaints to officials of ever increasing hierarchic status until grievances were properly addressed. If such a case reached the emperor—the last and final judge—and he decided that previous officials who heard the case had erred in their decisions, he would accordingly punish those officials and the original guilty party. If even the emperor for some reason made a fault in pardoning a party which was truly guilty, then Wang reasoned that the only explanation for a lack of justice was the will of heaven and its judgment which was beyond the control of mortal men. Wang insisted that submitting to the will of heaven in this regard was the right thing <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>while</b> a murdered father or mother could still be honored through ritual sacrifices.|$|E
