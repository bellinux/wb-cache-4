40|$|The {{liability}} of banks in electronic fund transfer (EFT) transactions {{is discussed in}} this thesis under the British and the United States law. The thesis covers banks’ liability in electronic credit and debit transfers. It covers banks’ liability in Electronic Fund Transfer at the Point Of Sale (EFTPOS), Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) and home and office banking. Liability of banks in credit card transactions and cheque truncation falls {{outside the scope of}} this thesis. In the absence of British legislation in this area, an analogy is made with the traditional methods of payment. An attempt is also made to extract the applicable rules from the general principles of law and the banking practice. The discussion, under the United States law, relies on analysing the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 and Article 4 A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which concern banks’ liability in consumer and commercially based EFT transactions. The thesis starts by analysing the legal nature of payment orders. In particular, whether a payment order is a negotiable instrument, a creation of trust funds, an assignation or merely a mandate from a customer to his bank. Chapter two discusses banks’ liability for failure to make an EFT transaction. This encompasses banks’ liability for complete failure to effect an EFT transaction and for improper implementation of such a transaction. Chapter three discusses the right <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>payment,</b> completion of payment, irrevocability and banks’ liability for failure <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>payment.</b> Chapter four discusses banks’ liability for erroneous EFT transactions. This includes allocation of losses resulting from errors in payment orders and errors committed by banks during the execution process of such orders. Chapter five discusses banks’ liability for unauthorised EFT transactions. Issues such as authentication of payment orders, security measures adopted by banks and allocation of losses resulting from unauthorised transactions are discussed in this chapter. Chapter six discusses the recoverability of damages for banks’ failure to implement customers’ instructions properly. It discusses what measures of damages are applicable in certain situations such as banks’ complete failure to make an EFT transaction, failure to transfer funds on time etc. The thesis is completed by summary and conclusion...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was prompted by}} 124 complaints received by the Ombudsman’s office about Centrelink’s administration of the activity test requirements following the implementation of Welfare to Work reforms on 1 July 2006. The report was critical {{of the practice of}} stopping a person’s welfare payment before a decision was made about whether or not a penalty should apply. Under the Welfare to Work reforms, a jobseeker who does not comply with an activity (such as attending an interview) can face an eight-week non-payment period for a third or subsequent participation failure (or breach) in any 12 -month period. Before a decision is made <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>payment,</b> the suspected breaches must be reviewed by a specialist Centrelink officer to check if the person had a reasonable excuse for not completing the activity. The Ombudsman’s investigation queried whether the practice of stopping a payment before a decision is formally made was supported by the social security law. Timeliness in decision making was also raised as an issue. The practices criticised in the Ombudsman’s report could adversely disadvantage Centrelink customers, by depriving them of the following options: arranging their financial affairs in anticipation of a penalty being imposed; applying for a review of Centrelink’s decision (because no formal decision had yet been made); accessing the Financial Case Management scheme administered by Centrelink, which can assist a customer to meet the costs of essential household and living expenses. The three agencies involved – Centrelink, the Department of Employment and Work Place Relations (as it then was) and the Department of Human Services – have all responded positively to the Ombudsman’s report...|$|E

40|$|I {{analyze the}} {{repayment}} decisions of firms with multiple loans that, for liquidity constraints or strategic reasons, <b>stop</b> making <b>payments</b> in some {{but not all}} their loans. Using a sample of commercial loans from Colombia over the period 2002 : 03 – 2012 : 06, I find that firms are less likely <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> making <b>payments</b> on loans granted by banks with which they have long relationships and by banks with which they have a clean repayment history. These results suggest that firms are concerned with losing the benefits gained through the relationship. I also find that firms are more likely <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> making <b>payments</b> on loans from foreign banks when compared to domestic banks, and equally on loans from state owned banks when compared to private banks. This suggests that the ability and willingness of the bank to punish the firm for misbehaving {{play an important role}} in a firm’s decision. Overall, the results suggest that firms assess their delinquency choices based on their perceived ability to obtain new loans in the future.

40|$|This thesis {{has three}} objectives: first, {{to examine the}} law {{relating}} to loss allocation resulting from fraud with consumer payment instruments and determine whether this allocation is efficient; second, to determine whether any right to stop or reverse payment associated with the payment instrument is efficient; and third, to suggest changes and reforms to achieve efficiency in these two areas. The basic test to determine efficiency of allocation of fraud loss {{to be used in}} the thesis involves looking at the following questions: which party in the transaction or system can, because of size, wealth, insurance, or the ability to pass on costs, best bear the risk of non–payment? Which party can most easily avoid the loss? And which rule is the least costly rule to enforce? In regard to electric funds transfer it was found that the test in the current Electronic Funds Transfer Code (EFT Code), although purporting to be worked out on efficiency principles is, in fact, unduly complicated and the thesis recommends the adoption of simple failure to report loss theft or fraud by the consumer as a test for allocation of fraud loss. Signature credit cards are currently not covered by the EFT Code and fraud loss allocation is determined by contract law but, nevertheless, a similar test is advocated in regard to them too. In regard to cheques it was found the forgery rule as regards the drawer’s signature and the ancillary Ligget rule are basically efficient but the rule regarding indorser’s signature is inefficient - making cheques not transferable would help eliminate this inefficiency. As to fraudulent alterations, it was advocated that paying banks should bear total loss for fraudulent and material alterations with a right, of course, against the person who has made the alteration. In regard to financial institution cheques, the thesis recommends that the definition of a financial institution cheque (which covers bank cheques) should be extended to cover cheques drawn by one financial institution on another one. It recommends that where consideration has been provided at any stage for a bank cheque then it should be able to be enforced. It was also advocated that the gist of the Australian Paper Clearing System assurances needs to be enshrined in legislation (an example of the sort of legislative change that would hopefully ensure certainty of payment has also been suggested). To ameliorate the position from an efficiency perspective, the following is also advocated: a duty of care in regard to the safekeeping of bank cheques should be introduced; responsibility for alterations should also be placed on the issuing banks as a spur to devise alteration proof bank cheques; and when consumers buy bank cheques they should be asked for what purpose it is being purchased and this should be written by the banks on the front of the bank cheque. Whether a uniform rule for fraud loss allocation across different payment systems is a possibility is also explored. It was found that a uniform rule for fraud loss allocation would seem to be more efficient than making efficiency ameliorations to existing fraud allocation tests in the various payment systems. Allied with the problem of fraud loss allocation is the issue of whether consumers should have a right of stopping or reversing payment if consumers perceive they are the potential victims of fraud or sharp dealing. Again the thesis examined whether this is efficient. In regard to cheques it was found that the right <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>payment</b> is efficient but that such a right could be ameliorated by allowing the drawer a right to set up any dispute against the vendor in the same action where the vendor/payee brings an action on the stopped cheque. Moreover, the right to stop cheques should be explicitly extended to stolen cheques. In addition banks should have to reaccredit the account in accordance with the stop payment order and banks should have the burden of proving that no loss stemmed from their error. On the other hand, in regard to financial institution cheques (including bank cheques) if they are to be effective cash substitutes, efficiency demands that purchasers not be allowed to use their disputes with the vendor, even if they may seem to involve fraud, to stop the banks paying out on the bank cheques, unless there is a court order. As to signature credit cards it is advocated the gist of American law on chargebacks absent any territorial restrictions should be put into Australian federal legislation. Allegations of contractual non compliance should require the buyer to send the goods back to the seller or, at least be able to show a bona fide attempt to do so, as a precondition to the exercise of chargeback rights and as part of a requirement that the buyer should make an attempt to first settle the matter with the seller. Proposed federal legislation covering chargebacks should also extend to other forms of electronic payment like BPAY as well as PIN credit cards. Chargeback rights should also apply where debit systems mimic cash but with a $ 150 threshold before they apply and subject to the goods being returned to the seller. Finally, the thesis explores whether a uniform right <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>payment</b> would be more efficient than the inconsistency and inefficiency of current Australian stop payment rules and concludes that such right should be along the lines of the never enacted American Uniform New Payments Code since is clear, concise and efficient compared with other attempts to formulate uniform rules. ...|$|E
