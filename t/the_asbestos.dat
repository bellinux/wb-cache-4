5|$|Dion {{moved to}} Asbestos, Quebec after the {{conclusion}} of his hockey career and {{became involved in the}} local minor hockey movement, often in the capacity of a referee. He helped establish an arena in the city, the Centre Récréatif d'Asbestos, in 1954, which was later renamed Aréna Connie Dion. Since 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Asbestos</b> Minor Hockey Association has held an annual tournament at the arena in his honor. He also became involved in golf, designing several courses and helping lay foundations for the sport in Asbestos. He had a local tournament named after him in this sport as well, the inaugural edition of which was held in 1973. He was married to Muriel Flanigan, who died in 2011, and had four sons, Paul, Skip, Bob, and Mickey, and one daughter, Carol-Ann. He died on November 7, 2014 at the age of 96 at the Centre de Santé et Service Sociaux in Asbestos, following a two-week period of hospitalization.|$|E

The chaplain of the regiment, well aware of Stanley's religious conviction and artistic background, requested him to decorate <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> walls at the altar area of a small open attap-roofed chapel at Bukit Batok. With charcoal salvaged from around the camp, he drew two murals: Nativity, which featured a Malay Madonna and Descent from the Cross in which he included soldiers in uniforms, using his comrades as models. By then, he was becoming ill and was suffering from a severe renal disorder complicated by amoebic dysentery. On 23 May 1942, Stanley was lying comatose and was sent to Roberts Barracks in Changi which was converted {{for use as a}} hospital for POWs to recuperate.|$|E

25|$|Chain metasilicates, {SiO}, form by the corner-sharing of an {{indefinite}} chain of linked {SiO4} tetrahedra. Many differences arise {{due to the}} differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra. A repeat distance of two is most common, as in most pyroxene minerals, but repeat distances of one, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and twelve are also known. These chains can then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons, as in <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> minerals, involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings.|$|E
25|$|The {{demolition}} of buildings containing {{large amounts of}} asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers – such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> has to be painstakingly removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the Red Road Flats in Glasgow, Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board for wall panelling – here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain {{times of the day}} in specially adapted vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007 it was {{discovered}} that the buildings contained a larger amount of asbestos than previously thought before they were purchased.

Samples of the minerals from here were displayed in London, and excited much interest. With the opening up of the Quebec Central Railway in 1876, mining entrepreneurs, such as Andrew Stuart Johnson established <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> industry in the province. The 50 ton output of the mines in 1878 rose to over 10,000 tons in the 1890s with the adoption of machine technologies and expanded production. For a long time, the world's largest asbestos mine was the Jeffrey mine in the town of Asbestos, Quebec.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{concerns}} over wooden construction, the Composites employed a number of vintage, turn-of-the-20th-century mechanisms {{to reduce the risk}} of fire. Most commonly, this involved the use of asbestos, electrobestos, or <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> containing material transite. Since the adverse health effects of such were not yet fully known nor understood, asbestos was present in numerous locations throughout the car, most notably under the floors, and around any electrical wiring. All of the undercar electrical equipment was housed in steel boxes. Steel and wood were used to complement each other and give rigidity to the body by strengthening the frame. However, the side paneling of the car remained wood. But as an added fireproofing measure, the wood siding would be encased in a layer of copper sheathing that ran halfway up the side of the car.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{tests in}} a {{certified}} asbestos-testing laboratory found the tremolite form of amphibole asbestos in {{three out of}} eight bigger brands of children's crayons that are made partly from talc: Crayola, Prang, and RoseArt. In Crayola crayons, the tests found asbestos levels from 0.05% in Carnation Pink to 2.86% in Orchid; in Prang crayons, the range was from 0.3% in Periwinkle to 0.54% in Yellow; in Rose Art crayons, it was from 0.03% in Brown to 1.20% in Orange. Overall, 32 different types of crayons from these brands contained more than trace amounts of asbestos, and eight others contained trace amounts. The Art and Creative Materials Institute, a trade association which tests the safety of crayons {{on behalf of the}} makers, initially insisted the test results must be incorrect, although they later said they do not test for asbestos. In May 2000, Crayola said tests by Richard Lee, a materials analyst whose testimony on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> industry has been accepted in lawsuits over 250 times, found two of its crayons tested negative for asbestos. In June 2000, Binney & Smith, the maker of Crayola, and the other makers agreed to stop using talc in their products, and changed their product formulations in the United States.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Schneider began {{investigating}} asbestos-related {{deaths in}} Libby, Montana, for the P-I.

Grace and Company, was alleged to have known {{about the dangers of}} exposure to <b>the</b> <b>asbestos</b> processed at the Libby mine and failed to disclose the risks to workers and government agencies in a timely manner. <b>The</b> <b>asbestos</b> contamination, according to Schneider, had killed at least 192 people in Libby, including the wives and children of miners, and at least 375 people were diagnosed with potentially fatal diseases associated with asbestos. The release of the story, entitled [...] "Uncivil Action: A Town Left to Die", gained national attention and led to litigation against W.R. Grace and the indictment of executives on federal charges of knowing endangerment, obstruction of justice, and wire fraud after the company declared bankruptcy and illegally transferred funds and assets to new companies. The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation into the Libby mine after the release of the story, and later established a Superfund cleanup site in Libby, declaring in 2009 that the town was under a public health emergency.|$|E
