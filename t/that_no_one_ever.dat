John later noted that he learned more about goaltending just from watching Frank than any coaching could, adding <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> helped him more to become the player he was.|$|E

25|$|The 1962 Prize {{awarded to}} James D. Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins—for {{their work on}} DNA {{structure}} and properties—did not recognize contributing work from others, such as Alec Stokes and Herbert Wilson. In addition, Erwin Chargaff, Oswald Avery, and Rosalind Franklin (whose key DNA x-ray crystallography work was the most detailed yet least acknowledged among the three) contributed directly {{to the ability of}} Watson and Crick to solve the structure of the DNA molecule—but Avery died in 1955, and Franklin in 1958 and posthumous nominations for the Nobel Prize are not permitted. However, recently unsealed files of the Nobel Prize nominations reveal <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> nominated Franklin for the prize when she was alive. Wilkins' crucial contribution was to show Rosalind Franklin's key x-ray photos to Watson. As a result of Watson's misrepresentations of Franklin and her role in the discovery of the double helix in his book The Double Helix, Franklin has come to be portrayed as a classic victim of sexism in science. Chargaff, for his part, was not quiet about his exclusion from the prize, bitterly writing to other scientists about his disillusionment regarding the field of molecular biology.|$|E
25|$|Several {{months after}} her presumed death, Ryan {{receives}} a champagne flute from Greenlee. Realizing <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> actually identified the body, he comes to believe that Greenlee is still alive. In November 2009, Ryan discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. Greenlee has been comatose {{for the past year}} and has no memory of the accident. Upon her awakening, David tells Greenlee that she is paralyzed and if she does not have surgery to fix her spine, she will remain paralyzed {{for the rest of her}} life. She tells David that she wants to do the surgery, but if she dies during surgery, not to tell anybody that she was alive before her death. After successfully recovering from her injuries, Greenlee attempts to visit Ryan but is surprised to see him having sex with Erica Kane. Out for revenge, Greenlee asks David to bring her a hard-drive hidden in Ryan's house. She puts the hard-drive into Fusion's computer and it crashes all the files. Even with Fusion's files being lost, Erica is set out to build Fusion back up once again; during an interview, she tells reporters that whoever crashed Fusion's computers has not destroyed the company. Greenlee feels that she has not done enough and decides to stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee asks David to marry her, hoping that when she walks down the aisle at her wedding, everyone will be surprised, and that Ryan will be hurt.|$|E

500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things <b>That</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> <b>Ever</b> Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things <b>That</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> <b>Ever</b> Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|Corgan {{initially}} blamed {{fans for}} the failure, then himself, {{saying that he}} [...] "made the mistake of telling people it was a techno record" [...] and that if he [...] "would have told everyone Adore was the Pumpkins' acoustic album we would have never had {{the problems that we}} had." [...] "Even the album title was misunderstood.", Billy Corgan wrote on the band's website that the title Adore “was a joke <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> got,” explaining that Adore was meant as a play on “A Door,” meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band’s career. [...] By the end of 1998, Corgan, who would later call the making of Adore [...] "one of the most painful experiences of my life", was already writing material for the band's next album, and Jimmy Chamberlin was readmitted into the band.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s in Levittown, New York, Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were {{all members of}} the band The Rookie Lot. They {{eventually}} split off from {{the other members of the}} group, and in 2000 formed Brand New in Merrick, New York. The band signed to Triple Crown Records and in 2001 released their debut studio album, Your Favorite Weapon. Their second album, Deja Entendu, was released in 2003 and marked a stylistic change for the band, one that garnered an extremely positive critical reception. The album's first two singles, [...] "The Quiet Things <b>That</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> <b>Ever</b> Knows" [...] and [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades", both received airplay on MTV2 and Fuse TV, entering the top 40 on the United Kingdom Singles Chart. Deja Entendu was eventually certified gold in the United States.|$|E

500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} season, Beiste {{continues}} as football coach, and is recruited by Will to co-direct the school musical West Side Story with guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Artie. Beiste orders {{the football team}} to play the Jets in the show. Beiste also takes {{on the task of}} running the school elections. In the episode [...] "The First Time", the coach begins dating Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins (Eric Bruskotter), who is scouting for talent at McKinley, but discovers in [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] that Sue has become a rival for Cooter's affections just as Beiste begins {{to fall in love with}} him, thus prompting the character's first solo song, [...] "Jolene". Beiste later tells Emma and Sue, in episode [...] "Yes/No", that Beiste and Cooter have impulsively gotten married. A few months later, in the episode [...] "Choke", Beiste is hit by Cooter and given a black eye. Although initially convinced by Sue and Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes) to leave for Beiste's own safety, the coach later returns home to give Cooter a second chance, before ultimately leaving him and giving him back his wedding ring. The catalyst for the final break is Puck (Mark Salling), a football player and glee club member. Beiste stops a fight between Puck and another student: Puck is wielding a knife, and the coach berates him for doing something so stupid. Puck calls himself a loser, and starts crying; Beiste cries with him, saying <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> thinks the two of them hurt because they are [...] "badasses", but they do. Beiste arranges for Puck to retake a geography exam he flunked, which is keeping him from graduating high school, and helps him study for it; he passes and graduates. In the interim, Beiste helps chaperone New Directions on their trip to Chicago, where they win the national show choir championship.|$|E

2500|$|Additions that Gage made to Truth's speech {{include the}} ideas that she could bear the lash {{as well as a}} man, <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> offered her the {{traditional}} gentlemanly deference due a woman, and that most of her 13 children were sold away from her into slavery. Truth is widely believed to have had five children, with one sold away, and was never known to claim more children. Further inaccuracies in Gage's 1863 account conflict with her own contemporary report: Gage wrote in 1851 that Akron in general and the press in particular were largely friendly to the woman's rights convention, but in 1863 she wrote that the convention leaders were fearful of the [...] "mobbish" [...] opponents. Other eyewitness reports of Truth's speech told a different story, one where all faces were [...] "beaming with joyous gladness" [...] at the session where Truth spoke; that not [...] "one discordant note" [...] interrupted the harmony of the proceedings. In contrast to Gage's later version, Truth was warmly received by the convention-goers, the majority of whom were long-standing abolitionists, friendly to progressive ideas of race and civil rights.|$|E
2500|$|In his allegations, Hochhuth called Filbinger [...] "such {{a dreadful}} lawyer, {{so that one}} has to presume that ... he is only living in freedom because of the silence of those who knew him." [...] As in the {{previous}} case, Filbinger filed a lawsuit against Hochhuth and Die Zeit, seeking to have the claim quoted above banned as libel. In contrast to the previous case, the court did not take the incriminated sentence as a unit but analysed and judged it bit by bit. On June 13, 1978 the court decided that Hochhuth's claims about illegal behaviour were indeed a libellous charges and banned the author from repeating them. However, The term [...] "a dreadful lawyer" [...] was deemed a judgement of opinion protected by freedom of speech. The court has been criticized for mistaken the causal connection between the two statements for a simple addition. Filbinger abstained from appealing the court's decision, and though Hochhuth did not repeat his [...] "illegality" [...] charges (and later even claimed <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> made such charges) the other allegation were echoed and variegated by the media.|$|E
