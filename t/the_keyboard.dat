5000|$|On March 3, 2009, Apple {{introduced}} an additional keyboard to their latest line of <b>keyboards.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>keyboard</b> {{is similar to}} <b>the</b> wireless <b>keyboard</b> due to <b>the</b> absence of the numeric keypad, however it is a wired keyboard with 2 USB 2.0 ports similar to <b>the</b> standard <b>keyboard.</b> Until this time <b>the</b> typical <b>keyboard</b> with <b>the</b> numeric keypad was titled [...] "Apple Keyboard", now <b>the</b> more-compact <b>keyboard</b> carries <b>the</b> name [...] "Apple Keyboard" [...] and <b>the</b> standard <b>keyboard</b> with numeric keys is titled [...] "Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad".|$|R
50|$|Tom Knight created both <b>the</b> Knight <b>keyboard</b> and <b>the</b> Space-cadet <b>keyboard.</b> <b>The</b> {{improvement}} from <b>the</b> Knight <b>keyboard</b> to <b>the</b> Space-cadet <b>keyboard</b> was <b>the</b> {{presence of}} two more modifiers for the bucky bits, Hyper and Super; the Super key modified the third bucky bit (representing a 4). From {{the usage of}} <b>the</b> Space-cadet <b>keyboard</b> on Lisp machines the Super key was inherited by Emacs as one of several supported modifier keys, most modern systems have to emulate the Super key using another.|$|R
5|$|Another World is a {{platform}} game, featuring a control scheme where the player uses either <b>the</b> <b>keyboard,</b> joystick or gamepad {{to make the}} protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} the album, the Furs {{launched}} a concert tour beginning in the UK, with their performance at the Hammersmith Odeon (10 October) broadcast live on BBC Radio One. The tour included the session players Gary Windo and Ann Sheldon, as well as <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> player Ed Buller. One person who did not come with them was Vince Ely, whose long-simmering dissatisfaction with the band finally led to his departure, just after the album's recording was completed. Ely was replaced as drummer by Phill Calvert, formerly of The Birthday Party.|$|E

5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more <b>keyboards.</b> <b>The</b> pipes produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them.

5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Solo rank {{features}} a 3-octave keyboard with 37 keys that are full width but shorter than standard. Directly above <b>the</b> Solo <b>keyboard</b> runs <b>the</b> Portamento <b>keyboard</b> - a ribbon controller {{which can be}} used to play continuously variable pitches roughly corresponding to <b>the</b> Solo <b>keyboard</b> note below. <b>The</b> Portamento <b>keyboard</b> overrides <b>the</b> solo <b>keyboard</b> if used simultaneously. The Solo rank has only a single oscillator, but has a dedicated low-frequency oscillator (LFO), pitch envelope generator and ring modulator.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The musicians {{included}} Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Keys, Jim Price and Dave Mason, all of {{whom had}} recently toured with Delaney & Bonnie. Along with Eric Clapton, there were also musicians whose link with Harrison went back some years, such as Ringo Starr and Billy Preston, and German bassist Klaus Voormann, formerly of Manfred Mann and a friend since the Beatles' years in Hamburg. Handling much of <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> work with Whitlock was Gary Wright, who went on to collaborate regularly with Harrison throughout the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E

5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang was {{qualified}} by {{his skills}} at <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> and violin, {{and by his}} compositional experience, for a post as Kapellmeister; but at 17 he was too young. He therefore remained in Colloredo's employ at the Salzburg court, increasingly discontent, until his dismissal from the Archbishop's retinue during its stay in Vienna, in 1781. Leopold, unpromoted from his rank of vice-Kapellmeister, remained with the court {{until his death in}} 1787.|$|E

5|$|Bennett edited some of <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> {{works of}} Beethoven and Handel and co-edited the Chorale Book for England with Otto Goldschmidt (1863), based on German hymns {{collected}} by Catherine Winkworth. He supervised the first British printed {{edition of the}} St Matthew Passion. A full vocal score (with piano accompaniment) was adapted from the German edition prepared by Adolf Bernhard Marx (Berlin 1830), which followed Mendelssohn's revival of the work; this was revised {{with reference to the}} score published by the Leipzig Bach Society in 1862. Bennett's additional tempo and dynamic markings were shown in parentheses for distinction. He provided harmonies for the figured bass both in the solo music sections (based on the Leipzig full score) and elsewhere. Bennett also produced editions of Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier and Handel's masque Acis and Galatea.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. <b>The</b> <b>keyboard</b> {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b> George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
