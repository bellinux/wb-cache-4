30|$|After the GMM-based {{background}} subtraction {{it has to}} {{be decided}} which of the detected foreground pixels in the binary mask represent true and reliable object regions. In spite of its good performance the background subtraction unit still needs a few frames <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>when</b> an object, which has not been moving for a long time, suddenly starts to move. During this period uncovered background regions, also referred to as ghosts, can be detected as foreground. To avoid a tracking of these wrong detection results we have to distinguish between reliable (true objects) and nonreliable objects (uncovered background). Since it does not make sense to track objects which only appear in the scene for a few frames, these objects are also considered as nonreliabel objects.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model in}} which agents have {{a conflict of interest}} over what instrument to use for policy adjustment in response to shocks. Three different government systems are analyzed: cabinet systems, in which one decision maker has full control over adjustment policies; consensus systems, in which adjustment policies must be agreed upon by all agents; and checks-and-balances systems, in which one agent decides what instrument should be used for adjustment, but the remaining agents may vetoits use. All three systems may lead to inefficient polices. The cabinet system adjusts too often. The other systems mail fail <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>when</b> adjustment is optimal. The relative performance of the three systems depends on the degree of political fragmentation and the size distribution of shocks...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{aggressive}} and over-protectiveness as an adult, continuous socialization {{as early as possible}} could allow the dog <b>to</b> <b>adjust.</b> <b>When</b> Chow Chows have reached adolescence they reject authority from any other owner who failed to earn its admiration. Aggression can be one distinctive behavioural characteristic in this breed, though while some are of an aggressive nature, many are known to be easy-going in nature - sometimes adopting an aloof disposition to individuals other than their owners. Aggression when it does appear is often towards other dogs of the same sex, especially Chows. Due to their strong hunting instincts, it is recommended that these dogs stay fenced, leashed, and away from cats and small dogs. This is why it is crucial that they are socialized early and consistently in order to act appropriately with strangers. At first, chow chows are very hesitant in interacting with strangers. However, this problem can be avoided if the owners train the chow chow at a young age.|$|R
