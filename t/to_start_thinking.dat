500|$|Critics of The Wild Bunch {{noted the}} theme {{of the end of the}} outlaw gunfighter era. Pike Bishop says, [...] "We've got <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast." [...] The Bunch live by an anachronistic code of honor without a place in 20th-century society. When they inspect Gen. Mapache's new automobile, they {{perceive}} it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) and The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970).|$|E

Despite this he was still proud of his players efforts: [...] "Thank you to our supporters, my staff and players who worked really hard and deserved a bit more." [...] Benítez was already thinking of making transfers {{in the aftermath of}} the match, hinting that his team lacked the same calibre of players that Milan had: [...] "You could see the quality they had, and we need <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> how we can improve our team." ...|$|E

And I don't want <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> about that. It's nice that they liked my movie, but I'm not going to start {{deliberately}} worrying about why or what I can do to make it happen again". Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E

500|$|The series {{sought out}} {{a bowling alley}} for the opening scenes, but many were {{reluctant}} to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen. The series was allowed to film at the location {{under the condition that}} the bowling surfaces were preserved. Due to this, the production staff was forced to either wear bowling shoes or wear makeshift [...] "paper booties" [...] on their feet. In between camera set ups, Duchovny and director Charleston bowled several games. Duchovny later joked that after the episode, he [...] "realized how old" [...] he was because he felt sore from all the bowling. He joked, [...] "when you get sore from bowling, it's time <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> about your life and where it's going." ...|$|E
500|$|When Manfredini {{returned}} {{for the first}} sequel, he had an easier time composing since he only needed to perfect what he had already created. Over {{the course of the}} sequels, Manfredini loosened the philosophy that the theme should be reserved just for the killer. Manfredini describes the style of the sequels as more of a [...] "setting 'em up and knocking 'em down" [...] approach, which meant that there were more [...] "McGuffins and red‑herrings" [...] that required the killer's theme music be played to try to trick the audience. Manfredini explains, [...] "The original had the real myopic approach, and then we had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> of the sequels as more conventional films." [...] For Part 3, Manfredini only returned to score the first and last reels of the film because he was busy with a Broadway production. Jack Tillar pieced together portions of the score from the first two films to fill the remaining time for Part 3, while Michael Zagar composed an opening and closing theme. Manfredini and Zagar met at the latter's apartment, where Zagar rescored the original opening theme using a disco beat. Manfredini {{returned for}} The Final Chapter, and although there were similar elements to the score, everything was newly recorded for the fourth Friday the 13th.|$|E
500|$|Writer Holly Harold {{noted that}} the {{introduction}} of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark {{was able to see}} how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as [...] "... soon-to-be Man of Steel". Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 23, Lincoln {{started his}} {{political}} career in New Salem. Near {{the top of his}} agenda was improvement of navigation on the Sangamon River. Lincoln's law partner and biographer, William H. Herndon, also reports an additional incident at the time: a boat Lincoln was on got stranded on a shoal; the boat gradually swung clear and was dislodged after much manual exertion. This event, along with the Offutt's boat/milldam incident, prompted Lincoln <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> about how to lift vessels over river obstructions and shoals. He eventually came up with an idea for inflatable flotation. Patent 6469 was awarded to Abraham Lincoln on May 22, 1849.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} Josie {{has been}} described as [...] "well-groomed...confident" [...] and someone who [...] "set high — if not impossible — standards, and inevitably people failed her." [...] She had few central storylines of her own, and in November 1999, it was reported that Matthew Robinson was axing the character. According to a report in the Daily Mirror, actress Joan Hooley was called into Robinson's office [...] "and told her services would no longer be required." [...] An insider is quoted as saying, [...] "The writers have been told <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> of ways to get rid of Josie. Obviously Joan was shocked, but the powers- that-be just didn't think it was working out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{account of}} CIA {{activity}} in Chile, however, states that {{during this period}} 1970-1973 the CIA worked diligently to propagandize the military into countenancing a coup, e.g., the CIA supported and cultivated rightists in the formerly [...] "constitutionally minded" [...] army <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> 'outside the box', i.e., to consider a coup d'etat. Thus, writes author Tim Weiner, while not per se orchestrating the 1973 coup, the CIA worked for years, employing economic and other means, to seduce the army into doing so. Allende's own actions may have caused relations with his army to become uneasy. The CIA sowed [...] "political and economic chaos in Chile" [...] which {{set the stage for}} a successful coup, Weiner concludes. Hence, Helms's careful parsing appears off the mark. Yet views and opinions differ, e.g., Henry Kissinger contests, what William Colby in part acknowledges.|$|E
2500|$|Col. Porter calls a {{briefing}} for the fighters in a classroom. [...] Long-distance communication collapsed when the Skitters detonated their EMP attack {{at the start}} of the invasion six months ago, leaving the resistance to have to rely on sending scouts to physically run west to try to find out more information, and the runners have finally returned. [...] Porter reports that they contacted another human resistance militia in the outskirts of Chicago, who in turn told them that they had contacted other resistance cells in Oklahoma and Texas, with fuzzy reports of surviving human resistance cells as far away as California. [...] The Massachusetts resistance cell is no longer alone, and they are going to begin coordinating a nationwide guerrilla war against the aliens. [...] Col. Porter says this means they have <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> tactically, gathering reconnaissance on Skitter tactics, technology, and troop deployments.|$|E

40|$|Recent trends towards {{increasingly}} {{parallel computers}} {{mean that there}} needs to be a seismic shift in programming practice. The time is rapidly approaching when most programming will be for parallel systems. However, most programming techniques in use today are geared towards sequential, or occasionally small-scale parallel, programming. While refactoring has so far mainly been applied to sequential programs, it is our contention that refactoring can play a key role in significantly improving the programmability of parallel systems, by allowing the programmer to apply a set of well-defined transformations in order to parallelise their programs. In this paper, we describe a new language-independent refactoring approach that helps introduce and tune parallelism through high-level design patterns targeting a set of well-specified parallel skeletons. We believe this new refactoring process is the key to allowing programmers <b>to</b> truly <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> in parallel...|$|R
