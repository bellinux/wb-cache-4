5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using <b>thoracotomy</b> in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open <b>thoracotomy,</b> VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E
5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (<b>thoracotomy</b> or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a <b>thoracotomy</b> (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} 49 {{patients}} (41 males, 8 females) with locally confined non small cell lung carcinoma, {{of the average}} age 58. 48 ± 9. 05 years, was retrospectively analyzed. Bronchoscopy, computed tomography of the thorax and transesophageal echosonography were performed in all the patients to evaluate preoperatively the loco regional dissemination of the disease {{as well as the}} tumor resectability.

25|$|Access is {{gained through}} a left lateral <b>thoracotomy</b> {{incision}} below the sixth rib. The inferior mediastinum {{is exposed to}} the level of the anterior aspect of the descending aorta. All of the shunting veins that direct blood to the collateral veins from the esophagus are ligated, taking special consideration to preserving the extraesophageal systemic venous collaterals (azygous veins). Usually between 30-50 shunting veins are present. Once devascularization is complete, the esophagus is clamped in two areas with esophageal clamps, and esophageal transection is done at the level of the diaphragm. The anterior muscular and mucosal layers are divided, but the posterior layer is left intact. Sutures are then placed and the divided varices are occluded. The muscle layer is then reattached. A nasogastric tube is left in situ, and the mediastinum is closed.|$|E

25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a <b>thoracotomy.</b> Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E
500|$|The {{chief of}} {{thoracic}} surgery, Benjamin L. Aaron, decided {{to perform a}} <b>thoracotomy</b> lasting 105 minutes because the bleeding persisted. Ultimately, Reagan lost over half of his blood volume {{in the emergency room}} and during surgery, which removed the bullet. In the operating room, Reagan removed his oxygen mask to joke, [...] "I hope you are all Republicans." [...] The doctors and nurses laughed, and Giordano, a liberal Democrat, replied, [...] "Today, Mr. President, we are all Republicans."

500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a common}} result of certain types of surgery; for example {{it is not unusual}} in chest surgery. [...] It may also occur from surgery around the esophagus, and is particularly likely in prolonged surgery. Other potential causes are positive pressure ventilation for any reason and by any technique, in which its occurrence is frequently unexpected. It may also occur as a result of oral surgery, laparoscopy, and cricothyrotomy. [...] In a pneumonectomy, in which an entire lung is removed, the remaining bronchial stump may leak air, a rare but very serious condition that leads to progressive subcutaneous emphysema. Air can leak out of the pleural space through an incision made for a <b>thoracotomy</b> to cause subcutaneous emphysema. [...] On infrequent occasions, the condition can result from dental surgery, usually due to use of high-speed tools that are air driven. [...] These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck, with an immediate onset, the crepitus (crunching sound) typical of subcutaneous emphysema, and often with subcutaneous air visible on X-ray.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{computer-assisted}} surgery, great progresses {{have been made in}} general surgery towards minimal invasive approaches.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{analysis was performed}} {{of the results of}} surgical excision of lung metastases in children to identify prognostic factors. From 1970 to 1992, 139 <b>thoracotomies</b> were performed in 91 patients between 1 and 19 years of age with metastases of osteogenic sarcoma (40 patients), nephroblastoma (24 patients), Ewing sarcoma (12 patients), and various other tumors (15 patients).

Twelve patients (50 %) with nephroblastoma are alive; 7 patients (18 %) with osteogenic sarcoma and 4 (27 %) with other tumors are alive. Negative prognostic factors were incomplete excision, primary tumor not controlled, or metastases developing during treatment. The number of metastases, the disease-free interval, unilateral versus bilateral metastases, preoperative and postoperative adjuvant treatment, and the number of <b>thoracotomies</b> performed were not of significant influence on outcome.

40|$|The cervico-thoracic {{junction}} (CTJ) extends {{between the}} 7 th cervical and the 4 th thoracic vertebrae and comprehends the inferior {{portion of the}} brachial plexus and the parenchymatous, vascular and nervous structures of the upper mediastinum.

Thus, further surgical approaches have been proposed: posterolateral, antero-lateral (<b>thoracotomies)</b> and purely anterior. The {{aim of this study}} was to discuss indications, key anatomical landmarks and risks of the main surgical approaches to the CTJ. Ten fresh cadavers from the Anatomical Laboratory of the University of Nantes (France) were used for the surgical dissection of the CTJ. The postero-lateral and the antero-lateral approaches were performed in 4 cadavers each and the anterior approaches were studied in 2.
