5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast financing gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E

30|$|This paper also {{focuses on}} {{different}} types of interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and government <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in <b>the</b> same region. First, the interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in <b>the</b> same region {{is much more important}} than the interdependence across different regions (Baur and Lucey 2009). Second, the paper investigates the interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in 39 countries. The samples already cover approximately 80 % of the global GDP, and therefore, it can be concluded that this paper’s analysis is reliable. The interdependence across different regions may result in an overly complicated analysis. In addition, over recent years the interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> has become quite valuable because the debt crisis {{is one of the most}} important parts in the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. The financial derivatives or the real estate markets are less liquid and important than government <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in most of the emerging markets.

In nominal terms, over the previous ten years (1995–2004) ABS amount outstanding had grown about 19 percent annually, with mortgage-related debt and corporate debt each growing at about 9 percent. Gross public issuance of asset-backed securities was strong, setting new records in many years. In 2004, issuance was at an all-time record of about $0.9 trillion.|$|E

25|$|Financing {{conditions}} differ between {{urban and}} rural areas. In {{the case of the}} NWSC, concessional debt contracted from international financial institutions had been passed on by the government to the utility in the form of debt. In February 2008, however, the government agreed to convert the NWSC's USH:153.5 billion debt into equity. This was done to increase the NWSC's ability to borrow from the local capital market. A week later, the NWSC announced that it intended to borrow USH:30 billion more on <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> to finance mitigation of the impact of Lake Victoria's receding levels on water supply. The NWSC expected to be able to borrow in local currency at lower interest rates and for longer maturities compared to borrowing from commercial banks. The World Bank assisted in structuring the bond issue. The Ugandan Ministry of Finance, however, stopped the bond issue from going ahead, citing the need to first use conventional concessional financing sources.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of knowing if countries whose activity of financing is mainly bank based face crises more expensive than those where <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> are broader and more developed. The results of the empirical tests on a panel of emerging countries suggest that bank based financial systems are associated with crises slightly more expensive, whereas the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> crises’ costs is fragile. Moreover, financial systems where <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> play an important role are associated with a higher growth of the production, and this, independently of the presence or not of crises.

25|$|The VOC was {{the driving}} force behind the rise of Amsterdam as the first modern model of (global) {{international}} financial centres that now dominate the global financial system. During the 17th century and most of the 18th century, Amsterdam had been the most influential and powerful financial centre of the world. The VOC also played a major role in the creation of the world's first fully functioning financial market, with the birth of a fully fledged capital market. The Dutch were also the first who effectively used a fully-fledged capital market (including <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> and the stock market) to finance companies (such as the VOC and the WIC). It was in the 17th-century Dutch Republic that the global securities market began to take on its modern form. And it was in Amsterdam that the important institutional innovations such as publicly traded companies, transnational corporations, capital markets (including bond markets and stock markets), central banking system, investment banking system, and investment funds (mutual funds) were systematically operated for the first time in history. In 1602 the VOC established an exchange in Amsterdam where VOC stock and bonds could be traded in a secondary market. The VOC undertook the world's first recorded IPO in the same year. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Amsterdamsche Beurs or Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser in Dutch) was also the world's first fully-fledged stock exchange. While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable government bonds, they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company to offer shares of stock. The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence. The launch of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange by the VOC in the early 1600s, has long been recognized as the origin of 'modern' stock exchanges that specialize in creating and sustaining secondary markets in the securities (such as bonds and shares of stock) issued by corporations. Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange. The process of buying and selling these shares of stock in the VOC became the basis of the first official (formal) stock market in history. It was in the Dutch Republic that the early techniques of stock-market manipulation were developed. The Dutch pioneered stock futures, stock options, short selling, bear raids, debt-equity swaps, and other speculative instruments. Amsterdam businessman Joseph de la Vega's Confusion of Confusions (1688) was the earliest book about stock trading.|$|E
500|$|The {{possibility}} of extending the Creek Turnpike beyond its original termini at US-75 and Memorial Drive was raised {{as early as}} 1993.

As a result of negotiations between Walters, other lawmakers, and OTA, the package was ultimately pared down to $675 million (about $ in [...] dollars); among the cuts was the eastern extension of the Creek Turnpike. This version of the package was approved by OTA on August 18, 1994. The package was ultimately killed almost two months later, when the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission voted 4–2 to stop the sale of the bonds associated with the project on October 3. Reasons for opposition to the package were varied, including concerns over OTA's debt level, toll increases necessary to fund the package, the state of <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>market,</b> a federal investigation examining previous OTA bond sales, lack of details given about the package, the size of the package, and the proposed method by which the bonds would be sold.|$|E
