5|$|The fire on {{the boat}} deck {{penetrated}} to a magazine. Evidence given to the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame {{could have been the}} ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of a 15-inch gunhouse.|$|E
5|$|S.E.5 no. A4850, {{fresh from}} its packing crate, was {{extensively}} modified for Ball: in particular {{he had the}} synchronised Vickers machine gun removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the cockpit. He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting. In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut on the flight line, and installing {{the members of his}} flight nearby.|$|E

5|$|Bond awakens, {{tied up with}} Natalya in the helicopter, {{which has}} been {{programmed}} to self-destruct. They escape but are captured and transported to the Russian military archives, where Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. Just as Natalya reveals {{the existence of a}} second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the Siberian massacre, Ourumov arrives and kills Mishkin. Intending to frame Bond for the murder, he calls the guards, but Bond and Natalya escape. In the ensuing firefight, Natalya is captured. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Trevelyan's train, where he kills Ourumov. Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya, setting it to self-destruct. As Bond cuts <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with his laser watch, Natalya triangulates Boris' satellite dish to Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes.|$|E
5|$|While {{opening up}} the attic door, Kyle is seized by an {{attacker}} and killed. They {{find out that the}} killer is Billy Lenz's sister Agnes, who has also set up the corpses of the sorority sisters around a Christmas tree. After Leigh falls <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the attic, Kelli is attacked by both Agnes and Billy. While fighting, the Christmas tree catches fire while she and Agnes fall down into one of the holes in the wall. Managing to escape with Leigh's help, they set the house on fire and reach the hospital. At the hospital, Agnes, who had survived the fire, kills Leigh but Kelli manages to kill her using a defibrillator. When Billy chases her to the stairs, Kelli manages to knock him over, impaling him on the finial of a Christmas tree and finally killing him. She is last seen staring at Billy's corpse.|$|E
5|$|By about 05:00, Dyck's {{ammunition}} {{supplies were}} running low, and the ZIPRA attackers {{had hit the}} Alamo {{a number of times}} with RPG fire. Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ {{in the form of a}} Lynx light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an FN MAG machine gun and SNEB rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of his cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed great admiration for James's bravery during this air strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had gone into the operational area against orders.|$|E

5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E

25|$|The {{monument}} was {{not immediately}} removed from the building for several reasons—pending legal hearings, the monument's weight, worries that the monument could break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> if it was taken outside intact, {{and a desire to}} avoid confrontation with protesters massed outside the structure. The monument was not actually removed from the state judicial building until July 19, 2004.|$|E

50|$|The game is {{considered}} an early first-person shooter, pre-dating Catacomb 3-D and Wolfenstein 3D.

25|$|The Palace Theatre, Confidencen, is {{situated}} in a building from the 1670s which was originally used as a horse riding house and later a guesthouse. In 1753, Queen Louisa Ulrika commissioned architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz to convert the building into a theatre. It was built in Rococo style, seats 200 spectators and has a table à confidence, a table which can be lowered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to the basement to be set. Today Confidencen is the oldest Rococo theatre in Sweden, reopened in 1981 and run since then by Kjerstin Dellert.|$|E
25|$|King Ludwig II of Bavaria in his castles of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, built {{during the}} same period as the Palais Strousberg took the invisibility of his {{servants}} one step further by having designed dining room tables which were lowered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to the kitchens below to be replenished between courses, negating the need for a servant's immediate presence completely. However, while the Palais Strousberg's layout of its servants' quarters was common throughout the capital cities of Europe, King Ludwig's seem to have been more an eccentricity peculiar to him.|$|E
25|$|The worst raid {{took place}} in the night of 10/11May 1941, when the Palace took at least twelve hits and three people (two policemen and the Resident Superintendent of the House of Lords, Edward Elliott) were killed. An {{incendiary}} bomb hit the chamber of the House of Commons and set it on fire; another set the roof of Westminster Hall alight. The firefighters could not save both, and a decision was taken to try to rescue the Hall. In this they were successful; the abandoned Commons Chamber, on the other hand, was destroyed, as was the Members' Lobby. A bomb also struck the Lords Chamber, but went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> without exploding. The Clock Tower took a hit by a small bomb or anti-aircraft shell at the eaves of the roof, suffering much damage there. All the glass on the south dial was blown out, but the hands and bells were not affected, and the Great Clock continued to keep time accurately.|$|E

50|$|The bath house {{south of}} the {{fortress}} was built between the 10th and 11th centuries. Its twin bathing rooms each with a single dome are still moderately intact. At one time it had used hypocaust heating as had originated in Roman times, to heat <b>the</b> <b>floors.</b> Pipes that ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> and walls of the structure were heated by a fire built under <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> which then forced the heat throughout the bathing rooms.

25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, {{who was doing}} his entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called to ring the bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted a Leap of Faith, {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Kane won the match when McMahon did not stand up in time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E
25|$|Baroque era cellos {{differed}} from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor),</b> while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make {{it much easier to}} tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.|$|E
500|$|Taking a {{year off}} from touring, TISM spent 1997 working on their next album with {{producer}} Lachlan Magoo.

The first official music video for the album, [...] "I Might Be A Cunt, But I'm Not A Fucking Cunt" [...] was rarely broadcast. Returned and Services League of Australia head Bruce Ruxton wrote a letter of complaint to Shock Records describing it as [...] "...

5000|$|The Barra {{system is}} a passive solar {{building}} technology developed by Horazio Barra in Italy. It uses a collector wall to capture solar radiation {{in the form of}} heat.
