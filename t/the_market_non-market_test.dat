40|$|<b>The</b> TVP labour <b>market</b> has {{undergone}} a great change during the economic reform period. Starting from a fully controlled recruitment system, more employees obtained employment through a more market oriented mechanism. This study applies human capital theory to investigate {{the impact of this}} institutional change on TVP wage determination. It is found that education as one of most important human capital variables plays an important role on the wage determination of those who obtained jobs through own effort (<b>the</b> <b>market</b> group), while it is insignificant for those who were assigned to the jobs (the non-market group). The further analysis suggests that although education plays different role on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> groups wage determination they are both productivity orientated. And the reason for this might be that the underlying technological processes of the work undertaken by <b>the</b> <b>market</b> group is higher than that for the non-market group. Does education, therefore, plays no role for the non-market group? The paper employs a logit model to prove that education is an important determinant for both <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and <b>the</b> <b>non-market</b> groups' occupational attainment. This suggests the following general picture: for <b>the</b> <b>market</b> group, there is a direct relationship between education, occupation and wage determination; for the non-market group this relationship is somewhat indirect. The rate of return to education {{is more likely to be}} reflected by non-wage benefit. ...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – “Structured content analysis” is used in analyzing the longitudinal data of five real estate enterprises from an industrial journal during the last seven years. Findings – Competitive interactions with <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> contents involve the expanded competitive scope, behaviors, and relationships. New explanations beyond previous literatures are provided to explain the expanded competitive behaviors (especially in resource-oriented and mixed scope) by analyzing the characteristics of actions and responses. Practical implications – Firms must effectively focus on <b>the</b> interaction of <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> competitive behaviors. Industrial competitors in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> environment can engage in collaborative or cooperative actions with non-market issues in order to obtain collective benefits.

To do so, I first explain the notion of "altruism", as {{can be found in}} the works of Adam Smith, Gary Becker and Ludwig von Mises. On these grounds, we can say that by voluntary altruistic transactions the utility of both sides of the transaction has been increased.

40|$|This paper {{systematically}} identifies <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> {{returns to}} education {{over the life}} cycle of gruaduates, as well as the social benefits externalities.

This is within the conceptual framework for lifelong learning defined by the graduate's life cycle, given that the capacity of graduates to learn later and to adapt is correlated with their prior schooling. The paper suggests that the capacity to finance lifelong learning depends on the capacity to identify and credibly measure these net social and private benefits, some of which are not well known and about which there is also misinformation. It also concludes that the capacity to finance education depends on political processes, which therefore are analyzed also, and on the capacity to build broad-based coalitions using knowledge about these marginal products. ...|$|R

This paper considers the problem of accommodating non-market values affected by wildfire in social benefit-cost analysis. There are substantial gaps in scientific understanding about how the spatial and temporal provision of non-market values are affected by wildfire, and considerable challenges in evaluating social welfare change arising from specific wildfire events. This presents serious impediments to adapting price-based decision-support tools, such as the National Fire Management Analysis System, to meaningfully incorporate non-market values. An alternative decision-support framework is proposed that measures departure from the historic range and variability of ecological conditions for those non-market values that are particularly resistant to price-based analysis. non-market valuation, historic range and variability, bushfire, wildfire policy, wildfire economics, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of agriculture {{to the welfare}} of society is determined by its economic, social and environmental performance. Although theoretical discussions {{can be found in the}} literature, few reports exist that integrate the social demand for multifunctional agriculture in the evaluation of the sustainability and the global welfare of society. This paper presents a methodology that combines economic valuation, integrated modelling, stakeholder analysis, and multi-criteria evaluation. It consists of three steps to determine: (1) social demands for multifunctional agriculture; (2) feasible technical alternatives available from the supply part of the market; (3) the net utility of alternatives for society measured as the change in social net benefit, i. e. the sum of changes compared to the current situation expressed in utility of <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> net benefits. <b>Market</b> net benefits are represented by their monetary value. Quality Function Deployment combined with Analytic Network Process (QFD/ANP) were used to estimate the non-market net benefits. The methodology is applied to the case study of a dairy-farming based agricultural landscape in the Northern Friesian Woodlands, The Netherlands. Social net benefit depended on land use, i. e. pasture management regimes on each of the agricultural fields and on presence or absence of hedgerows around the fields. Changes in market net utility were expressed in terms of changes for farmers, consumers and government. Changes in non-market net utility were expressed in terms of changes in landscape quality, nature value and environmental health for Dutch society as a whole, as estimated from European public surveys (Eurobarometer). The complete solution space defined by <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> net benefits of landscapes with alternative patterns of land use was estimated to offer insight in <b>the</b> trade-off between <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> performance and enable selection of `icon¿ landscapes to target or avoid. Improvement of the current landscape towards the social optimum would involve changes in pasture management resulting in higher gross margin for farmers, slightly relaxing current environmental restrictions, which could be reached at lower levels of subsidies in agri-environmental programs. In addition to such overall optimum the results demonstrate <b>the</b> trade-off between <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> benefits and the characteristics of current, utopian and dystopian landscapes. The approach provides an alternative to current economic valuation methods which focus on assessment of economic value as an input to analysis. Here, economic value emerges as <b>the</b> trade-off between <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> functions which is an output of the analysis...|$|R

Places with large technological endowments, which include ICT infrastructure, contribute to the vitality of entrepreneurial and innovative activities. This is particularly the case for high-tech industries like software or knowledge-based services which intensely utilise technology (Heger et al. 2011). Indeed, Henderson et al.

This paper takes a step in this direction, evaluating livelihoods for CSA farmers through in-depth interviews conducted in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts. Based on the principles early advocates set forth as goals of the CSA movement, the paper evaluates how CSA farmers are doing from the farmers’ perspective. The paper finds that while CSA farmers are faring better than other farms across the United States and in the study region in terms of earned farm income, they still earn far less than the median national income of all households. Despite these income challenges, CSA provides broader social, ecological, and economic benefits to farming communities as a whole, with its focus on providing food for the community rather than producing mass commodities for <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> These <b>non-market</b> benefits are a significant source of well-being from the CSA farmers’ perspective...|$|R

Therefore, this research directed attention to gauging the forces using Porter’s five market forces (2008) and Prasad’s (2011) non-market forces (national culture and history) framework together with measuring the benefits of complementors. Each of the forces was measured and key drivers within each force were identified. A base case revenue scenario was built on forecasts and the impact of the major forces was tied to the income statement to determine sensitivity of the revenue forecasts. The results suggest that the buyer power and the substitute power are the major competitive forces. The power of complementor products was also found significant and an entrant could counter the predicted losses in profitability due to influences of these <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> forces by providing product-product bundles thus reaping considerable improvements in net present value (NPV) and internal rate of returns (IRR) on investments. The NPV from this analysis thus yielded a range between $ 0. 97 and $ 7. 5 million with an IRR ranging between 29. 9 % and 35. 8 % depending on the variables considered in the sensitivity analysis.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how different environmental policy types differentially impact firms and why firms {{vary in their}} responses to such policies. Based on the mechanisms embedded in policy instruments to create incentives for firms to comply, the characteristics of benefits/costs that policies impose on firms and the institutional context in which policy instruments were created and are sustained, the paper identifies five policy categories. These are category I (command and control), category II (market based), category III (mandatory information disclosures), category IV (business–government partnerships) and category V (private voluntary codes). Different policy types often bestow asymmetrical benefits/costs on firms. Some benefits/costs may constitute ‘private/club goods’ while others may constitute ‘public goods’. Drawing insights from public policy literature, the paper argues that firms {{can be expected to}} favor policies whose benefits have the characteristics of private/club goods but the costs of public goods. Thus, understanding the nature of benefits/costs (private/club versus public) and the magnitude of their excludability is critical in explaining the variations in firms' responses. To understand how managers perceive the nature of benefits/costs (monetary as well as non-monetary), the paper draws on theories and perspectives in the business and public policy field. In doing so, the paper examines the ‘demand’ and the ‘supply’ sides as well as <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> environments of a given policy. Thus, the paper makes a case for a multi-theoretic approach to understand variations in managerial assessments of benefits/costs, and consequently variations in their responses to various policy types...|$|R
40|$|With {{tropical}} deforestation {{a major contributor}} to greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss, the land-use decisions of small-scale farmers at the forest margins have important implications for the global environment. Farmers’ incentives for maintaining forest fallow in a shifting cultivation agricultural system depend upon <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> services it provides to them. This study estimates the value of those services, including hydrological externalities that may affect other farms downstream. The analysis uses cross-sectional farm-level survey data from the Zona Bragantina in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon to assess the value of forest fallow to farmers and test whether it provides local externalities. I estimate production functions for crops and forest products to determine the contributions of on-farm and off-farm forest fallow to income from these two activities. Instrumental variables and spatial econometric approaches help address issues of endogeneity and variation in unobservable factors over space. I use geographic information on the location of farms to obtain data on external forest fallow and to model the hydrological externality as an upstream-to-downstream process. The results indicate that fallow does contribute significantly to productivity both on-farm and downstream, boosting income from both crops and forest products. In addition, most farms appear to allocate sufficient land to fallow, accounting for both the value of hydrological spillovers and the opportunity cost of land left out of cultivation. These results suggest that farming communities may have some self-interest in preserving forest cover locally—a finding that may bolster policy efforts aimed at conserving tropical forests.

40|$|There is an {{emergent}} {{and serious}} {{need to understand}} and communicate {{the social and economic}} implications of the biophysical outcomes that will be driven by climate change on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and how these will affect regional economies on the Queensland seaboard. This paper is the first of a two part series on this topic. The primary focus of this first paper is to evaluate global climate change predictions and the contemporary biophysical research findings with an evaluation of the methods used to determine the socio-economic impacts of coral bleaching and lost reef productivity. The second paper will deal with the results of extensive research measuring the socio economic impacts of climate change on the Recreational Fishing, Commercial Fishing and Tourism Industries in three nodes of Cairns, Townsville and Mackay regions. Specifically, this paper presents a discussion of global climate change, particularly with respect to identifying key implications for both Australia and the GBR. An in-depth explanation of the biology of coral bleaching and its consequences is explored, including changes in coral species, reef fish assemblages and reef productivity. The paper then describes the different socio-economic values associated with a functioning reef community and provides an assessment of tools used to value <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and <b>non-market</b> functions of coral reefs. Details of previous socio-economic valuation studies undertaken for coral reefs are discussed. Finally, the paper closes with suggested approaches to, and limitations on, the measurement of key socio-economic impacts resulting from climate change and consequent coral bleaching on the GBR...|$|R
