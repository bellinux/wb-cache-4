50|$|The Inner Fishing Harbour was {{constructed}} along the Tema Main Port in 1962 {{to provide a}} handling facility for semi-industrial and industrial fishing vessels, and to encourage {{the development of the}} local fishing industry. In 1965, the Outer Fishing Harbour {{was constructed}} for bigger industrial vessels such as trawlers, <b>tuna</b> <b>vessels,</b> and deep-sea carriers. The trawlers operating in the area are 30-45 m long and are able to land 55-65 tonnes of fish (usually redfish and club and scad mackerel) per fishing trip. The <b>tuna</b> <b>vessels</b> range from smaller boats around 45-50 m in length, able to land 200-250 tonnes of catch, to larger versions with a length of 50-65 m and the ability to land up to 650 tonnes per fishing trip. The largest fishing vessels, the deep-sea carriers (with lengths of 90-105 m), are mostly chartered vessels. Since 1984, the national catch has averaged about 200,000 to 300,000 metric tonnes per annum. Ghana's tuna catch has maintained a stable level of 30,000 tonnes per annum since 1981.|$|R

40|$|The tuna {{industry}} in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) {{is one of the}} largest and most valuable fisheries in the world. Since the 1980 s, Pacific island countries have used licensing agreements with foreign fishing interests [...] known as access agreements [...] to earn tuna-related revenue and control the environmental impacts of fishing, with only minimal success. To date, there has been little work detailing the structure of access agreements and assessing how this structure relates to economic and environmental outcomes in the sector. This article helps to fill this gap by providing an overview of various access structures and a detailed empirical assessment of how these structures are applied in access agreements between Pacific island countries and the major foreign fishing interests active in the WCPO. This analysis is placed in the context of evolving regional fisheries management structures. The study reveals that while there is no uniform formula for access agreements, each structure is subject to distinct political, economic and environmental considerations that influence outcomes for Pacific island countries. As Pacific island countries develop the mechanism to allocate fishing rights under the new Vessel Day Scheme, drawing on their long history with access agreements will assist efforts to use access to achieve policy objectives. Improved transparency will enable Pacific island countries to identify successes and problems and adapt the Vessel Day Scheme allocation mechanisms accordingly.

40|$|Data and samples {{obtained}} in the Marquesas Islands from 1954 to 1960 {{form the basis of}} this report. Various morphological traits of the Marquesan sardine, Sardinella marquesensis, are described, and measures of their variation are given. These sardines were found mostly in bays with clear to slightly turbid and clear-green to brownish-green water and with substrate of sand, rock, coral rubble, or a combination of these. The composition of their stomach contents was very similar to that of plankton {{obtained in}} sardine habitats. Ten of the 35 species of fish taken with sardines in the seine are probable predators of the latter. Sardine behavior in the field, in captivity, and as tuna bait is noted. Parasites included hemiurid trematodes, camallanid nematodes, and an ergasilid copepod. Attainment of sexual maturity is estimated at a standard length of 84 mm. Spawning is believed to occur throughout the year. Between 1, 000 and 8, 000 ova are deposited at a single spawning. The sex ratio favored males.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to supply the first {{information}} on age and growth for Thunnus obesus caught in the equatorial south-western Atlantic using dorsal spines, an approach that has been successfully employed for ageing tuna species. The study was conducted using a multi-model inference based on information theory for back-calculated and observed length-at-age data. Uncertainty associated with the parameter estimation was verified and results were compared to other accounts on the species, considering both the statistical and methodological contexts. Samples were collected in Natal city (Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil) from February 1999 to January 2000, of <b>tuna</b> <b>vessels</b> and from surveys, aimed at providing information on the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the area around São Pedro and São Paulo Archipelago. Validation using marginal increment indicated that one ring is deposited per year. Mean length-at-age ranged of 54. 3 to 177. 5 cm (fork length) for ages 1 to 9 years. Von Bertalanffy, Richards, and Gompertz models were considered suitable for the bigeye tuna. Hence, the model-averaged asymptotic length ¯L&# 8734; was estimated.

40|$|Tropical tuna purse-seine {{fisheries}} spatially co-occur {{with various}} megafauna species, such as whale sharks, dolphins and baleen whales in all oceans of the world.

We applied a Delta-model approach using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) models, accounting for spatial autocorrelation using a contiguity matrix based on a residuals autocovariate (RAC) approach. The variables that contributed most in the models were chlorophyll-a concentration in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as depth and monsoon in theIndian Ocean. High co-occurrence between whale sharks, baleen whales and tuna purse-seine fisheries were mostly observed in productive areas during particular seasons. In light of the lack of a full coverage scientific observer on board program, the large, long-term dataset obtained from logbooks of <b>tuna</b> purse-seine <b>vessels</b> is highly important for identifying seasonal and spatial co-occurrence between the distribution of fisheries and megafauna, and the underlying environmental variables.

40|$|Abstract only. Tuna {{fishery is}} the main one, in quantity, for both Azores and Madeira Atlantic islands and for Azores it is decisive for the {{survival}} of the local tuna canning industry. The main catches are from skipjack and bigeye tuna species, the last one with TAC restrictions. From a strategic perspective it is important to take in account not only the state of the stocks and the level of the catches but also the technical characteristics of the fleet and the socioeconomic dimensions of the value chain. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to calculate the technical and scale efficiencies of the tuna fleet, both in cross sectional and longitudinal studies. While the type of boats, the technology, the seasonal production pattern and the fishing areas are similar, there are large differences penalizing the Azores fleet that increases when landings are price valued. The results show the reasons why, that are mainly, for the quantity landings, the scale effect and, for the value landings, the market power of the canning industry. A systemic analysis is then used to integrate different dimensions of the value chain, from the fisheries to the canning industry exports.

40|$|The Japanese {{tuna fishing}} {{industry}} has undergone many structural transitions throughout its history, being {{regulated by the}} fisheries law according to vessel type, operational areas (pelagic, coastal etc.) and other criteria {{for each type of}} fishing method (type of fishery). These historical changes and institutional issues have come to be strongly influenced by international factors as: (1) the tuna species targeted by the Japanese tuna industry are distributed throughout the vast temperate and tropical ocean regions of the world and are highly migratory species, or migrating through high seas and many coastal waters under national jurisdiction; (2) the fishing grounds targeted by Japanese <b>tuna</b> <b>vessels</b> encompass most ocean areas of the world; and (3) Japan is the only market for sashimi tuna while the raw tuna for canned products is internationally marketed.

Results Quantitative results are shown for the forces and moments around a pair of unequally sized dolphin-like slender bodies. These include two major effects. First, the so-called Bernoulli suction, which {{stems from the fact that}} the local pressure drops in areas of high speed, results in an attractive force between mother and calf. Second is the displacement effect, in which the motion of the mother causes the water in front to move forwards and radially outwards, and water behind the body to move forwards to replace the animal's mass. Thus, the calf can gain a 'free ride' in the forward-moving areas. Utilizing these effects, the neonate can gain up to 90 % of the thrust needed to move alongside the mother at speeds of up to 2. 4 m/sec. A comparison with observations of eastern spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) is presented, showing savings of up to 60 % in the thrust that calves require if they are to keep up with their mothers.
