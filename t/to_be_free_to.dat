5|$|During the 1980s, a Thrud {{comic strip}} {{was a regular}} and popular feature in the roleplay and wargame {{magazine}} White Dwarf with Thrud's grotesque and comic antics forming a memorable part of the magazine's golden age. In 2002, continued interest in the character from role-playing enthusiasts and a desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> experiment with a new artistic style prompted Critchlow to self-publish a series of award-winning full-length Thrud the Barbarian comics.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of}} the 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than going}} to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their {{followers}} escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.|$|E

5|$|Krips {{left the}} LSO in 1954, and the {{following}} year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute. The principals argued {{that the future of}} the LSO lay in profitable session work for film companies, rather than in the overcrowded field of London concerts. They also wished <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts if there were a clash of dates. The LSO's board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate the principals, most of whom resigned en masse, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{were well}} aware that their victory was still fragile, and {{that as soon as}} the Parthian king had dealt with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, he was forced to act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could not be ignored by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority were at stake. Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E

25|$|Joan Miró {{was among}} the first artists to develop {{automatic}} drawing as a way to undo previous established techniques in painting, and thus, with André Masson, represented the beginning of Surrealism as an art movement. However, Miró chose not to become an official member of the Surrealists in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> experiment with other artistic styles without compromising his position within the group. He pursued his own interests in the art world, ranging from automatic drawing and surrealism, to expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Four-dimensional painting was a theoretical type of painting Miró proposed in which painting would transcend its two-dimensionality and even the three-dimensionality of sculpture.|$|E

30|$|The {{ability to}} perform code repairs {{involving}} more than one failure is a desirable feature {{in most of the}} distributed storage systems that can experience multiple simultaneous failures [12].
