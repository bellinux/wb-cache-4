40|$|An {{important}} evolutionary {{challenge is}} to detect and attain food while avoiding becoming food. More generally, {{this is the problem}} of approaching rewards and avoiding punishments. Structural models of affect distinguish between dimensions of positive and negative affect; contemporary personality theories organize traits in terms of abilities to detect and achieve benefits or rewards while avoiding costs or punishment. (E. g., Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory examines this challenge in terms of a) individual differences in sensitivity to cues for reward and punishment and b) in terms of behavioral activation (either approach or withdrawal) and behavioral inhibition.) By examining the interrelationships of Affect, Behavior, Cognition, and Desires (the ABCDs of personality), we are able to <b>tease</b> <b>apart</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which stable personality traits (e. g., E & N) reflect patterns in how current affective states and long term desires combine to affect the cognitive representation of the environment. I will review prior work on personality and categorization and discuss how focusing on the cognitive and affective aspects of specific learning and judgment tasks allows for a richer understanding of the basis of personality traits...|$|R

30|$|We {{note that}} ideally {{we would have}} liked to select {{multiple}} drought and non-drought years from each site, in order to better <b>tease</b> <b>apart</b> <b>the</b> abiotic and biotic drivers of isotopic signatures and growth trends. However, logistic constraints meant we could either sample multiple years for a small subset of species and/or sites, or we could sample across the entire species pool, but only for two contrasting years at each site. As the main goal of our analysis is to understand whether or not carbon isotope ratios and stem growth show a clear and coordinated response to drought across Europe’s forests, we chose to focus on the later of these two options. Further work will be needed to <b>tease</b> <b>apart</b> <b>the</b> ecological, physiological and environmental mechanisms that underpin the general relationships we uncover here.|$|R
