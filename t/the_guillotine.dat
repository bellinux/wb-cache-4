5|$|Saint-Just {{was arrested}} in the violent episode of 9 Thermidor and {{executed}} {{the next day with}} Robespierre and their allies. In many histories of the Revolution, their deaths at <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> mark the end of the Reign of Terror.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez was a monarchist {{at heart}} and he despaired when King Louis XVI went to <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> on 21 January 1793. He found the {{political}} situation in Paris to be chaotic. He was appalled at the tendency of radicals to interfere with army commanders. Having already negotiated with the enemy, Dumouriez offered to treat and the Austrians sent Mack on 25 March. The French commander proposed to take the army and march on Paris. He would overthrow the National Convention, crush the Jacobins and restore the Constitution of 1791. For their part, the Austrians pledged to halt their advance while he carried out his coup. But Dumouriez moved too slowly. On 1 April, four commissioners and the War Minister Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville arrived at his headquarters to demand that the commander explain himself in Paris. They were seized and {{handed over to the}} Austrians.|$|E
5|$|In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was {{initially}} unable {{to form a}} consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened. By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report {{in the name of}} the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> on 31 October 1793. Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.|$|E
50|$|At the {{exchange}} site, the Han and Shephards {{appeared in a}} display of unity and force, there to complete {{the exchange}} of prisoners when Haidu dispatched his rifle attack squadron on both <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> and <b>the</b> Shepherds; Bai-Lan {{was killed in the}} attack. Shocked at the attack on his own teammates, Leng resisted Haidu in open defiance to the emperor's will, making him an enemy target as well; both <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> and Shepherds survived the attack and escaped to safety. Confused as to what has happened, it was then Leng revealed his real identity to <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines.</b> <b>The</b> team was furious and wanted to know is Leng here to finish them off, however, he told his team to scatter and survive. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> wouldn't live long.|$|R
50|$|With {{reports that}} Wolf has {{fled to the}} outer frontiers, the squad tracks the Shepherds to a remote village outpost, heavily {{occupied}} by Han and smallpox-diseased inhabitants. Added to the mission, the Qianlong Emperor (who favors advanced weaponry over antiquated assassins) has sent his most trusted agent, Haidu (secret sworn brother to Leng and right-hand man to the emperor) for the same mission. Unknown to <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines,</b> <b>the</b> emperor wants to absolve his legacy and <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> is a living taint to his rule; they must be erased. Although Leng knew of the emperor's intentions and also wanted to help end <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines,</b> <b>the</b> group has become a family {{to him and he}} couldn't eliminate them. Therefore, Haidu was also sent there to finish a job Leng didn't have the heart to do; the definitive moment would help during their exchange.|$|R

5|$|It {{would take}} almost two full years {{until the first}} French Constitution was signed on 3 September 1791, and it {{required}} another popular intervention to make it happen. Louis attempted {{to work within the}} framework of his limited powers after the women's march but won little support, and he and the royal family remained virtual prisoners in the Tuileries. Desperate, he made his abortive flight to Varennes in June 1791. Attempting to escape and join up with royalist armies, the king was once again captured by a mixture of citizens and national guardsmen who hauled him back to Paris. Permanently disgraced, Louis was forced to accept a constitution more denuding of his kingship than any previously put forward. The spiral of decline in the king's fortunes culminated at <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> in 1793.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a handicap match- a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) and Shaniqua. During the match Hotty attempted a worm on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by clotheslining Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to flip over the top ring rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a Samoan drop. Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to retain the championships. Next was a Singles match, in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> choke on Nidia. Noble won the match after he forced her to submit with this move.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Paine, {{considered}} too moderate {{by the powerful}} Jacobin wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door. When James Monroe, {{at that time the}} new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of The Age of Reason, despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence. (Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.|$|E
50|$|The 1976 Hong Kong film Master of <b>the</b> Flying <b>Guillotine</b> {{serves as}} an {{unofficial}} sequel to another film Flying Guillotine (1974), produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio and directed by Ho Meng-hwa. In 1978, the Shaw Brothers Studio produced two more movies, <b>The</b> Flying <b>Guillotine</b> 2 and Vengeful Beauty. Other films in which flying guillotines are shown include <b>The</b> Fatal Flying <b>Guillotine</b> (1977), Octopussy (1983), The Heroic Trio (1992), Iron Monkey 2 (1996), Seven Swords (2005), The Machine Girl (2008) and <b>The</b> <b>Guillotines</b> (2012).|$|R
50|$|The Hans {{have been}} oppressed by their Manchurian-ruled government, causing social unrest and {{internal}} conflicts. Tian-Lang (Wolf), is the charismatic prophetic Han rebel {{leader of a}} group known as the Shepherd Gang. Wolf was captured alive by Leng and Wolf tells him that Leng is destined to kill him, but not at this place and time. Wolf was scheduled for execution the following day, however, Wolf's gang ambushes the execution parade and fends off both <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> and <b>the</b> Green Army; it allowed Wolf to escape, but Bai-Lan (Shepherd member) was captured. In the chaos of fighting, Wolf takes Musen (the only female member of <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines)</b> hostage in hopes to exchange back Bai-Lan. However, <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> were dispatched to recover both Musen and finish off Wolf.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally <b>the</b> <b>guillotines</b> were {{manually}} operated by turning a large wheel some 150 times to raise or lower the gate; since the locks {{have to be}} left empty this operation will {{always have to be}} done twice to pass through. In recent years the Environment Agency, who are the navigation authority for the river, have been installing electric operation of <b>the</b> <b>guillotines</b> and in some cases replacing them altogether with mitre gates.|$|R
25|$|The {{only time}} <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> {{was used in}} North America was in Saint-Pierre in the late 19th century. Joseph Néel was convicted of killing Mr Coupard on Île aux Chiens on 30 December 1888, and {{executed}} by guillotine on 24 August 1889. <b>The</b> <b>guillotine</b> had to be shipped from Martinique {{and it did not}} arrive in working order. It was very difficult to get anyone to perform the execution; finally a recent immigrant was coaxed into doing the job. This event was the inspiration for the film The Widow of Saint-Pierre (La Veuve de Saint-Pierre) released in 2000. <b>The</b> <b>guillotine</b> is now in a museum in Saint-Pierre.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>guillotine</b> {{became the}} tool for {{a string of}} executions. Louis XVI had already been guillotined {{before the start of}} the terror; Queen Marie Antoinette, Barnave, Bailly, Brissot and other leading Girondins, Philippe Égalité (despite his vote for the death of the King), Madame Roland and many others were {{executed}} by guillotine. The Revolutionary Tribunal summarily condemned thousands of people to death by <b>the</b> <b>guillotine,</b> while mobs beat other victims to death.|$|E
25|$|In October 1789 Doctor Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, in the {{interest}} of finding a more humane method, successfully had the means of execution changed to decapitation by a machine he perfected, <b>the</b> <b>guillotine,</b> built {{with the help of a}} Paris manufacturer of pianos and harps named Tobias Schmidt and the surgeon Antoine Louis. The first person to be executed with <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> was the thief Nicholas Jacques Pelletier, on 25 April 1792. After the uprising of the sans-culottes and the fall of the monarchy on August 10, 1792, <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> was turned against alleged counter-revolutionaries; the first to be executed by <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> was Collenot d'Angremont, accused of defending the Tuileries Palace against the attack of the sans-culottes; he was executed on 21 August 1792 on the place du Carousel, next to the Tuileries Palace. The King was executed on the Place de la Concorde, renamed the Place de la Revolution, on 21 January 1793. From that date until 7 June 1794, 1,221 persons, or about three a day, were guillotined on the Place de la Revolution, including Queen Marie-Antoinette on 16 October 1793. In 1794, for reasons of hygiene, the Convention had <b>the</b> <b>guillotine</b> moved to the place Saint-Antoine, now the rue de la Bastille, near the site of the old fortress; seventy-three heads were cut off in just three days. In June 1793, again for reasons of avoiding epidemics, it was moved to the Place du Tron-Renversé (the Place of the Overturned Throne, now Place de la Nation). There, at the height of the Reign of Terror, between 11 June and 27 July, 1,376 persons were beheaded, or about thirty a day. After the execution of Robespierre himself, the reign of terror came to an end. <b>The</b> <b>guillotine</b> was moved to the Place de Grève, and was used only for the execution of common criminals.|$|E
50|$|During the Manchu-ruled Qing Dynasty, the Yongzheng Emperor {{established}} a secret assassination squad {{known as the}} 'Guillotines' to eliminate all who posed a threat to him. Once heavily favored by <b>the</b> emperor, <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> are deemed expendable once the Qianlong Emperor ascends to the throne and adopts Western ideas and technology. To consolidate his power under a new regime, the Qianlong Emperor continues to use <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> to persecute <b>the</b> conquered Han Chinese in a reign of terror and oppression. <b>The</b> current <b>guillotine</b> squad is led by master fighter Leng and it consists of six young warriors: Musen, Houjia Shisan, Chen Tai, Hutu, Su and Buka. Serving the Qing court unquestioningly, they have never failed in 348 missions to eliminate their targets. However, their most recent mission would make it their last.|$|R
50|$|Jing {{then started}} {{to focus on}} his acting career, and {{featured}} in many Chinese films including The Bullet Vanishes (2012), <b>The</b> <b>Guillotines</b> (2012), Up in the Wind (2013), and Rise of the Legend (2014).|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} had officially decreed <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> as wanted criminals {{in league with}} the Shepherds. Publicly forsaken by their own emperor and given a huge bounty upon their heads, <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> were cruelly killed off one by one. Saddened and enraged, Leng confronted Haidu and called Haidu a [...] "lap dog," [...] infuriating him to shoot Leng down a cliff; Leng survived and was nursed back to health by Wolf in a peaceful secluded village. Confused {{as to why he}} was saved, Wolf did it out of mercy; to Leng's surprise, he found Musen as part of the village. Musen no longer wanted to be a <b>Guillotine</b> (after learning <b>the</b> cruelty <b>the</b> <b>Guillotines</b> had caused to Wolf's family) and only lived there as a villager. After talking with Wolf, Leng finally admits he's secretly Han Chinese. Leng tells Wolf that it was the former emperor that chose him to be the right-hand man for Qianlong and his Han identity was replaced with a Manchurian one. Although Leng is now on Wolf's side, Wolf prophesied that Leng will kill him very soon.|$|R
