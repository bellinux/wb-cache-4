5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of <b>the</b> <b>instructors</b> of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (D. Ed.) [...] Boston UniversityAlthough it {{recommended}} that pre-service elementary teachers {{be provided with}} opportunities to develop mathematical understanding through engagement in experiences where they reason, explain, justify and generalize about mathematics, much still remains to be learned about how a mathematics teacher educator can support pre-service teachers in developing understanding during these experiences. This study investigated the instructional decisions of an experienced instructor in an undergraduate mathematics course for pre-service elementary teachers as he supported developing understanding around geometric measurement topics. Two lessons on the geometric measurement topic of area formulas were considered by the researcher. Multiple {{interviews were conducted with}} <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> including a pre-interview session, four video-stimulated recall sessions, and one post-interview. All observed lessons and interviews were recorded and transcribed. Lastly, participants completed a Pre-test and Post-test on area formula. Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>instructor's</b> descriptions of his teaching enabled the researcher to construct a description of the intended implementation of the two area formula lessons. Video-stimulated recall sessions along with the classroom observations and interviews were used to analyze <b>the</b> <b>instructor's</b> decisions during teaching. <b>The</b> <b>instructor's</b> actions, decisions, and strategies during whole-class discussion were mapped to the Math-Talk Learning Community Framework (Hufferd-Ackles, Fuson & Sherin, 2004) in order to provide a description of how <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> actually supported <b>the</b> development of participants' mathematical understanding. Three levels of instructional decisions emerged. High-level decisions included <b>the</b> <b>instructor's</b> choice of curriculum and his use of discussion as the primary instructional methodology. Mid-level decisions included <b>the</b> <b>instructor's</b> decisions around <b>the</b> social and academic norms created in the classroom. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> provided few explicit mathematical statements so that participants were the source of mathematical ideas. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> would not accept partial mathematical justifications from participants. Also, to engage the class in discussion, <b>the</b> <b>instructor</b> reminded participants of their roles as future teachers and their responsibility to ask questions of each other. Micro-level decisions included <b>the</b> <b>instructor's</b> choice of when and how to use talk moves (Chapin, O'Connor & Anderson, 2013) and his selection of discussion participants. There was evidence that participants' understanding improved as shown by significant change in achievement on the Area Formula Pre- and Post-test.
