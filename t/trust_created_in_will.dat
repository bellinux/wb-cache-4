25|$|Testamentary trust (or <b>Will</b> Trust): A <b>trust</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> an individual's <b>will</b> {{is called}} a {{testamentary}} trust.

5000|$|Trusts {{have existed}} since Roman times {{and have become}} one of the most {{important}} innovations in property law. [...] Trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states, so statements in this article are generalizations, understanding the jurisdiction-specific case law involved is tricky. Some U.S. States are adapting the Uniform Trust Code to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain.

5000|$|Trusts are {{a special}} breed of {{contract}} {{in that they}} often govern the disposition of property {{in the same way}} a [...] "last will and testament" [...] does via a probate proceeding. Many states differ as to their procedures concerning the interpretation and administration of <b>trusts</b> <b>created</b> during life (i.e., the inter vivos <b>trust)</b> versus those <b>created</b> <b>in</b> a <b>will</b> which are typically subject to jurisdiction in probate proceedings (the testamentary trust). The UTC attempts to standardize the general composition of both trust forms and their requirements, but does not generally attempt to address the procedural questions as to overall subject-matter jurisdiction and other aspects of proceedings involving trusts. [...] Instead, the vagarities of various state and local procedural rules will generally apply.|$|R

40|$|Eureka (1848) {{has been}} taken at face value as an {{expanded}} version of a lecture on cosmology that Poe gave earlier the same year. However, its seriousness {{as a work of}} science should be questioned. Its treatment of themes found in other works by Poe shows the author’s unconcern for consistency, and the text unlikely to have resulted from a serious engagement with scientific argument. Instead it should be approached as a hoax: an attempt to reveal the gullibility of its readers. Poe’s hoaxes relied for their effect on the <b>trust</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> readers by their recognition of generic conventions, and Eureka exploited and ridiculed public trust in cosmological lecturers such as John Bovee Dods...|$|R
