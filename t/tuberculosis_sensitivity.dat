40|$|Background. Although sputum smears are {{the gold}} {{standard}} for diagnosis of <b>tuberculosis,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in HIV/TB coinfection cases is low, indicating a need for alternative methods. Urine is being increasingly evaluated. Materials and Methods. A novel method for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in synthetic urine using a combined IMS/ATP assay was evaluated. Preliminary work established standard ATP conditions and the sensitivity and specificity of the MTB antibody. Eighty-four blinded samples in four replicate assays were evaluated for the presence of MTB using labeled immunomagnetic beads for capture. Beads were separated, washed, and resuspended in broth and added to a microtiter plate. Bioluminescent output was measured and signal-to-noise ratios were calculated. All samples were plated on Middlebrook 7 H 10 agar or trypticase soy agar to determine limit of detection and recoveries. Results and Conclusions.

Pyrazinamide susceptibility {{was determined by the}} pyrazinamidase test. Results: Drug-resistance was noted in 17. 6 % of 188 isolates tested, including 14. 9 % to isoniazid, 4. 3 % to rifampicin, 6. 4 % to streptomycin, and 1. 1 % each to ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was noted in 4. 3 %. Acquired MDR (14. 3 %) was significantly higher than initial MDR (1. 5 %). There was no difference in the drug resistance rate in urban and rural communities. Conclusion. Previous treatment for tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk of MDR tuberculosis. The low prevalence of resistance to the primary anti TB drugs except isoniazid suggests a low treatment coverage of TB patients.

There is no evidence {{as to whether or}} not residents in homes in the United Kingdom have a similar risk. METHODS [...] A study was undertaken to determine whether residence in a home for the elderly increases the risk of tuberculosis infection. Over a six month period all residents in homes for the elderly in Liverpool received a tuberculin test. A health questionnaire was completed by the field team for each resident. A total of 2665 residents in homes for the elderly were surveyed. RESULTS [...] Heaf test grade positivity declined with age, the odds ratio being 0. 71 for each 10 year period. Adjusting for age, there was no change in Heaf test grade with length of stay in the home. Heaf test positivity was stronger in smokers (odds ratio 1. 59) than ex-smokers (odds ratio 1. 20) and non-smokers. Heaf test grade positivity was directly related to pack years.

40|$|Abstract Background In many {{resource}} poor settings only sputum microscopy {{is employed}} for {{the diagnosis of}} HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis; sputum culture may not be available. Methods We determined the diagnostic accuracy of sputum microscopy for active case finding of HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis using TB culture as the reference standard. Results 2216 potential subjects screened for a TB vaccine trial submitted 9454 expectorated sputum specimens: 212 (2. 2 %) were sputum culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), 31 (0. 3 %) for non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and 79 (0. 8 %) were contaminated. The overall sensitivity of sputum microscopy was 61. 8 % (131 / 212) and specificity 99. 7 % (9108 / 9132). Sputum microscopy sensitivity varied from 22. 6 % in specimens with 100 CFU/specimen plus confluent growth. The incremental diagnostic value for sputum microscopy was 92. 1 %, 1. 8 % and 7. 1 % for the first, second and third specimens, respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive values for sputum microscopy were 84. 5 % and 99. 1 %, respectively. The likelihood ratio (LR) of a positive sputum microscopy was 235. 1 (95 % CI 155. 8 – 354. 8), while the LR of a negative test was 0. 38 (95 CI 0. 32 – 0. 45). The 212 positive sputum cultures for MTB represented 103 patients; sputum microscopy was positive for 57 (55. 3 %) of 103 patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with non-tuberculous {{mycobacteria}} {{are usually}} started on conventional antituberculous triple therapy once acid fast bacilli are detected, before the exact type of mycobacteria has been identified. The {{ability to identify}} the characteristics of patients with tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacteria may {{be helpful in identifying}} before treatment those patients more likely to have non-tuberculous infection. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all patients in one unit in whom non-tuberculous mycobacteria were identified in sputum or bronchoalveolar washings in the period 1987 - 93. The pattern of drug resistance was determined from laboratory records, and all case notes and chest radiographs were reviewed to identify the underlying disease and treatment outcome. All cases were compared with a matched control group of patients with culture positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnosed during the same period. RESULTS: In the period studied there were 70 non-tuberculous and 221 tuberculous isolates. The non-tuberculous bacteria were typed as follows: M xenopi 23 (33 %), M kansasii 19 (27 %), M fortuitum 14 (20 %), others 14 (20 %). Of those with non-tuberculous mycobacteria, 83 % were white subjects compared with 47 % for tuberculosis. Patients with non-tuberculous mycobacteria were older than those with tuberculosis. Pre-existing lung disease or AIDS was present in 81 % of patients with non-tuberculous mycobacteria and in 17 % of patients with <b>tuberculosis.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> to rifampicin and ethambutol was seen in 95 % of M xenopi and 96 % of M kansasii isolates. Relapse occurred in 60 % of cases infected with M xenopi, 20 % infected with M kansasii, and in 7 % of cases with tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: In the population studied non-tuberculous mycobacteria occurred most frequently in elderly white subjects with pre-existing lung disease. If mycobacteria are detected in this group, consideration should be given to the possibility of non-tuberculous infection before embarking on treatment. A combination containing rifampicin and ethambutol is effective.

We used one of the available assays, the enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT test) (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK). The ELISPOT has been widely used for screening for latent infection(3 - 5) and has been compared with the tuberculin skin tests (TST) (6, 7). In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of ELISPOT in the diagnosis of childhood TB. Specificity was estimated in a group of BCG-vaccinated children with no known exposure to M. <b>tuberculosis</b> infection. <b>Sensitivity</b> was determined in three defined groups, confirmed, probable and possible tuberculosis. METHODS The study was conducted, after obtaining ethical approval, and with informed consent from the paren...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop an {{antibody}} immunoassay for tuberculous meningitis with a sensitivity greater than that of the initial bacterial smear while maintaining a 100 % specificity. Antibody titers to five purified antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were measured in cerebrospinal fluid by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Seventy-four patients with tuberculous meningitis (26 culture positive) were compared with 26 patients with purulent meningitis, 69 patients with suspected but excluded tuberculous meningitis, and 29 patients with other neurological diseases. Antibody responses to both the 14 -kilodalton (kDa) antigen and lipoarabinomannan were immunodominant, accounting for 74 % of those with any antibody titer to a soluble extract of M. <b>tuberculosis.</b> A <b>sensitivity</b> of 61 % was achieved (77 % for the culture-positive samples) by using immunoglobulin G titers to lipoarabinomannan and the 14 -, 19 -, and 38 -kDa antigens. Thus, estimation of levels of antibody in cerebrospinal fluid to selected mycobacterial antigens would be valuable in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. The possible reasons for the immunodominance of the 14 -kDa antigen and lipoarabinomannan in the pathogenesis of tuberculous meningitis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} pattern of drug {{resistance}} among smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients in an inner city area in Vietnam. METHODS: A random sample of patients diagnosed by the national TB programme (NTP) were offered HIV testing and submitted sputum for Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> drug <b>sensitivity</b> testing. RESULTS: Of 1433 isolates from new patients, 360 (25 %) were resistant to isoniazid (INH), 57 (4. 0 %) to rifampicin (RMP), 421 (29 %) to streptomycin (SM) and 28 (2. 0 %) to ethambutol. Among 401 previously treated patients, this was 218 (54 %), 109 (27 %), 217 (54 %) and 26 (7 %), respectively. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 55 (3. 8 %) new and 102 (25 %) previously treated patients. RMP resistance was strongly associated with resistance to INH (OR 46) and INH plus SM (OR 91, P = 0. 004). Prevalence of drug resistance tended to decrease with age. Neither any resistance nor MDR {{was significantly associated with}} HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: In this inner city area, levels of drug resistance, in particular of MDR among previously treated patients, are high. This {{may be related to the}} use of NTP regimens in the context of highly prevalent combined SM and INH resistance which may favour acquisition of RMP resistanc...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2. 0 in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in sputum smear-negative pulmonary TB cases. A total of 572 Ziehl-Neelsen sputum smear-negative samples were selected and subjected to line probe assay (Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2. 0), and culture in mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT- 960). Immunochromatographic {{test was used to}} confirm the MTB-complex (MTBC) in culture-positive samples and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing was done using MGIT- 960. The line probe assay was able to diagnose MTBC in 38. 2 % (213 / 558) of specimens after excluding 14 nontuberculous mycobacteria. Sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 68. 4 % and 89. 3 % respectively, considering MGIT- 960 culture as gold standard after excluding contaminated and invalid results. On comparing with composite reference standard, the assay had 71. 5 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity in the diagnosis of <b>tuberculosis.</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> and specificity for detecting resistance to rifampicin (RMP) were 100 % and 99. 24 % respectively and for resistance to isoniazid (INH) were 97. 62 % and 98. 55 %, respectively. Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2. 0 is a rapid and precise diagnostic tool for detection of MTB in sputum smear-negative samples. It also facilitates accurate diagnosis of RMP and INH resistance within turn around-time...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionPolymerase chain {{reaction}} (PCR) -based techniques to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in respiratory specimens have been increasingly used to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis. Their use in non-respiratory specimens to diagnose extrapulmonary tuberculosis is, however, controversial. In this study, we estimated {{the accuracy of}} three in-country commercialized PCR-based diagnostic techniques in pleural fluid samples for the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis. MethodsPatients underwent thoracenthesis for diagnosis purposes; pleural fluid aliquots were frozen and subsequently submitted to two real time PCR tests (COBAS®TAQMAN®MTB and Xpert®MTB/Rif) and one conventional PCR test (Detect-TB®). Two different reference standards were considered: probable tuberculosis (based on clinical grounds) and confirmed tuberculosis (bacteriologically or histologically). ResultsNinety-three patients were included, of whom 65 with pleural tuberculosis, 35 of them confirmed. Sensitivities were 29 % for COBAS®TAQMAN®MTB, 3 % for Xpert®MTB/Rif and 3 % for Detect-TB®; specificities were 86 %, 100 % and 97 % respectively, considering confirmed tuberculosis. Considering all cases, sensitivities were 16 %, 3 % and 2 %, and specificities, 86 %, 100 %, and 97 %. DiscussionCompared to the 95 % sensitivity of adenosine deaminase, the most sensitive test for pleural <b>tuberculosis,</b> the <b>sensitivities</b> of the three PCR-based tests were very low. We conclude that at present, there is no major place for such tests in routine clinical use...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} no convenient way to effectively evaluate whether a miliary tuberculosis patient is complicated with {{central nervous system}} (CNS) tuberculosis. We aimed to find such a way by analyzing the clinical data of these patients. Fifty patients with confirmed miliary tuberculosis and 31 patients with confirmed miliary tuberculosis complicated with CNS tuberculosis from 2010 to 2014 were selected. Their general conditions, clinical features and laboratory tests were analyzed. Factors that were significantly different between them were chosen to performed multivariate and univariate logistic regression analyses, and factors with significant P values were used to establish a scoring system. Eight factors, i. e., age, cough, nausea, headache, hemoglobin (HGB), serum albumin (ALB), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were significantly different (P < 0. 05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ALB was the independent risk predictor (HR = 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 52, P < 0. 01), whereas the others were non-independent predictors except age (P < 0. 05). The scoring system {{was based on a}} summation of the scores of the assigned values of the seven predictors and had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 86 to confirm CNS <b>tuberculosis,</b> with a <b>sensitivity</b> of 81. 5 % and a specificity of 81. 4 % at a score of 0. 75 and with a specificity of 95. 3 % at a score of 2. 75. In contrast, a score below - 0. 75 excluded CNS <b>tuberculosis,</b> with a <b>sensitivity</b> of 88. 9 % and a specificity of 62. 7 %. The scoring system should be useful to evaluate whether a miliary tuberculosis patient is complicated with CNS tuberculosis and could help doctors avoid excessive investigation...|$|R
40|$|A 42 -year-old male {{patient was}} {{admitted}} at our hospital {{for treatment of}} smear-positive pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB). Drug <b>sensitivity</b> testing revealed extensively drug-re-sistant TB, and the isolate appeared only susceptible to cycloserine, linezolid, clarithromycin, and clofazimine. Ac-cording to the WHO treatment guidelines for TB, the treat-ment regimen was composed of these four drugs, as no other options were available (11). Linezolid was the cornerstone of this regimen {{because of the high}} in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC of 0. 125 to 0. 5 mg/liter) (1, 8). Linezolid is a toxic drug, and its labeled duration of administration is therefore limited to 28 days to prevent peripheral neuropathy and anemia. Dose reduction has been evaluated in TB patients as an attempt to reduce toxicity to allow prolonged treatment for 18 to 24 months (6...|$|R
