5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of the new}} {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's strangling represented {{more than a simple}} coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class and away from the Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their legitimacy from the deeply held cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied the erosion of certain traditional social values among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> the legitimacy of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, {{the field of}} mathematics—specifically algebra—underwent a {{profound}} revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, {{as well as on}} the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846 by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.|$|E
5|$|Ursa Minor is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven {{brightest}} stars seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (ladle or scoop). The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E

5|$|When Sedna was discovered, its extreme orbit raised {{questions}} about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant (approximately 75 AU) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna's eccentric distant orbit. It is {{too far from the}} planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by outside forces such as the galactic tides. Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star, that it was captured from another planetary system, or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-Neptunian planet. The most obvious solution <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> Sedna's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region, whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history. If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-Neptunian planet, any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna (around 80 AU).|$|E
