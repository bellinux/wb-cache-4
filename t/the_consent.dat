5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of anyone else.|$|E

5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany.

The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances.

Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E

40|$|How does <b>the</b> law {{construct}} <b>consent?</b> This Article explores {{this question}} {{in the context of}} Supreme Court decisions regarding third-party consent to searches of dwellings. Using textual analysis, a method rarely used in Fourth Amendment law, this Article argues that the Supreme Court employs an a-contextual and gender-blind analysis of consent that is insensitive to power dynamics. Using the feminist scholarship on consent, this Article critiques <b>the</b> notion of <b>consent</b> as developed by the Supreme Court. At the same time it rejects the feminist redefinition of consent as vague and unclear. This Article proposes that <b>the</b> third-party <b>consent</b> to search doctrine involves a triangular relation between the police officer, <b>the</b> <b>consenting</b> third-party, and <b>the</b> suspect. Accordingly, this Article explores each edge of the triangle. This triangular relation analysis shows that the problematic notion of consent is more acute in third-party consent cases than in other consensual search cases. Thus, this Article proposes the abolition of <b>the</b> third-party <b>consent</b> to search doctrine...|$|R

Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army.

In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E
