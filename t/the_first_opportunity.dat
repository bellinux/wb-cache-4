In 1908, he was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown and received nine months sick leave which he spent at home. He successfully managed a coal mine in West Virginia, but returned to active duty in the Marine Corps at <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud was {{observed}} {{within hours of}} its start. It was the first supernova to be detected through its neutrino emission {{and the first to}} be observed across every band of the electromagnetic spectrum. The relative proximity of this supernova has allowed detailed observation, and it provided <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for modern theories of supernova formation to be tested against observations.|$|E
5|$|With the Eagles, Bell {{led the way}} in {{cooperating}} with the other NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to afford the weakest teams <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought a share in the Pittsburgh Steelers. During World War II, Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.|$|E

5|$|As {{the crew}} {{worked through the}} {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity.</b> A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow according to the terms of the Armistice. Rheinland and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. However, a copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity.</b> On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantis {{crew had}} two Florida return {{opportunities}} for the day, {{as well as two}} for a California landing, giving the managers time to evaluate the weather and use California if necessary. After choosing to pass on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for KSC and evaluate the second, managers on the ground decided that the weather in Florida was too dynamic to risk bringing the orbiter in, and opted to land at Edwards Air Force Base instead. The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, a burn of the shuttle's engines that brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Atlantis successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2million miles.|$|E

5000|$|Nicholas D'Agostino Sr. (1910-1996) was a {{supermarket}} magnate in New York City. He {{and his brother}} Pasquale (1905-1960) were Italian-American immigrants and the founders of D'Agostino Supermarkets, one of New York's historically original and leading grocery chains.

5|$|The {{new owners}} faced a chaotic situation. The team had few players under contract, {{and had made}} little effort to sign any of their draft picks, most of which had signed with the NFL. The league {{attempted}} to strengthen the Jets and the woeful Oakland Raiders {{by allowing them to}} select players from the other six teams, and by giving them <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> to sign players cut from NFL rosters. Ewbank, who had discovered Colts great Johnny Unitas at an open tryout, held tryouts for the Jets. Only seven of the participants were invited to training camp, and one, Marshall Starks, made the team as a second-teamer. In mid-July, it was announced that the Jets could not move into Shea Stadium until 1964.|$|E
5|$|With the {{continuation}} of the war in South Africa, a number of regiments containing large centres of population formed additional regular battalions. The King's (Liverpool Regiment) formed 3rd and 4th regular Battalions in February 1900, when the militia battalions were relabeled as the 5th and 6th battalions. The Boer War also provided <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the regiment's volunteer battalions to serve overseas with regular forces, supplying individual detachments and service companies. The militia battalions, numbered the 5th and 6th during the war, contrastingly deployed to South Africa intact late in the conflict. A memorial sculpted by William Goscombe John to commemorate the regiment's service in Afghanistan, Burma, and South Africa was erected in St John's Gardens, Liverpool and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on 9 September 1905.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow under the terms of the Armistice. Westfalen and her three sisters—the oldest dreadnoughts in the German navy-were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. During the internment, a copy of The Times informed the German commander, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired.

5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> of {{the match}} came in the fifth minute when Kerala Blasters midfielder, Iain Hume, put Michael Chopra through on goal only for Josemi to deny Chopra with a last-minute tackle. The Blasters then had the second {{realistic}} chance {{of the match}} five minutes later when Pulga received {{the ball in the}} box from Saumik Dey but his shot went out for a corner after a deflection off Atlético's Borja Fernández. The pressure continued to mount on Atlético de Kolkata as their goalkeeper Apoula Edel was forced into action; first he had to punch away a direct free-kick from Stephen Pearson before Ishfaq Ahmed's shot moments later was caught by the keeper. Atlético de Kolkata had their first major chance of the match in the 26th minute when Arnal put Mohammed Rafi through on goal, only for Nirmal Chettri to make a last-ditch tackle to keep the score level. The score would remain 0–0 going into half time.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty {{that ended the}} war.

Baden was the last major warship to begin the scuttling process, and British forces in the harbor managed to secure the ship and run it aground before it could sink in deeper water. Then-Lieutenant Commander Bruce Fraser led the British sailors who boarded Baden. Baden was the only capital ship not successfully sunk in the scuttling. The ship was refloated in July, after which she was towed to the British naval base at Invergordon.|$|E

Hindenburg was the last ship to sink, at 17:00. Her captain had deliberately arranged that the ship sank on an even keel to make it easier for her crew to escape. After several unsuccessful attempts, she was raised on 23 July 1930, only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932. Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine (Federal Navy) on 28 May 1959.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty.

Markgraf sank at 16:45. The British soldiers in the guard detail panicked {{in their attempt to}} prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships; they shot and killed Markgrafs captain, Walter Schumann, who was in a lifeboat, and an enlisted man. In total, the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty-one. The remaining crews, totaling some 1,860 officers and enlisted men, were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{can be measured}} from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit of Venus occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able to analyse sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique to analyse light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001, this was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> to gain conclusive results in this way on the atmosphere of Venus since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering {{the lack of information}} on the atmosphere between 65 and 85km. The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the {{upper atmosphere}} of Venus, but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The atmosphere of mostly CO2, absorbs near-infrared radiation, making it easy to observe. During the 2004 transit, the absorption in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength revealed the properties of the gases at that altitude. The Doppler shift of the gases also enabled wind patterns to be measured.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his {{period in}} the cabinet, Heffron {{was seen as a}} {{prominent}} and well-performing member of the government, and as such a potential contender for the premiership. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for Heffron came in February 1946, when McKell announced to the Labor caucus of his intention to resign before the 1947 election. McKell, with the intention of ensuring Heffron as his successor, remained as an MP even after Prime Minister Joseph Chifley had announced his appointment as Governor-General in order to vote for Heffron. At the ballot on 5 February 1947, Heffron lost by two votes to the Minister for Housing, James McGirr, who was favoured by the more Catholic and conservative caucus members. When McGirr announced his resignation on the grounds of ill health on 1 April 1952, Heffron put himself forward as a candidate to succeed him against, among others, Deputy Premier Joseph Cahill. However, the day before the ballot on 3 April, Heffron had been made aware that he would not have the numbers in caucus to win against Cahill and consequently made arrangements with Cahill to give the votes of his bloc to Cahill, in exchange for his support to become Deputy Premier. As a result, on 3 April Cahill defeated Attorney General Clarrie Martin 32 votes to 14 to become Premier and Heffron defeated Mines Secretary Joshua Arthur 32 votes to 14 to become Deputy Premier.|$|E
