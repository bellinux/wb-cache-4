5|$|The Renown class {{comprised}} {{a pair of}} battlecruisers built {{during the}} First World War for the Royal Navy. They were originally laid down as improved versions of the s. <b>Their</b> <b>construction</b> was suspended on the outbreak of war on the grounds {{they would not be}} ready in a timely manner. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart <b>their</b> <b>construction</b> as battlecruisers that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but they were delivered {{a few months after the}} Battle of Jutland in 1916. They were the world's largest and fastest capital ships upon completion.|$|E

5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was secular {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters {{were not a}} {{practical}} necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for <b>their</b> <b>construction</b> at these two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E
5|$|Charles R. Forbes, the {{energetic}} {{director of the}} Veterans' Bureau, sought to consolidate control of veterans' hospitals and <b>their</b> <b>construction</b> in his bureau. At the start of Harding's presidency, this power was vested in the Treasury Department. The politically-powerful American Legion backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him, like Secretary Mellon, and in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans' Bureau. Forbes' main task was to ensure that new hospitals were built {{around the country to}} help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.|$|E

Kaiser and Deutschland were laid down in 1871 and 1872, respectively. Kaiser was launched on 19 March 1874 and commissioned into the fleet on 13 February 1875.

40|$|Drawing {{on social}} constructionist theory this paper applies {{discourse}} analysis to ten narratives told by service delivery staff in one distribution network. The analysis looks {{at how the}} narratives construct the organization through <b>their</b> <b>constructions</b> of self (the narrator), customer and manufacturer and <b>their</b> <b>constructions</b> of the relationships linking these three sets of actors. The paper argues that the narrators construct the self either as an organizational customer or an organizational partner. The two constructions locate conflict either within the organization or at the customer-organizational boundary respectively. The implications of this are suggested. Contrasts between {{the manner in which}} organizational members construct the self as customer or partner and the construction of the organizational member in the internal customer literature are highlighted and briefly discussed.

If the four ships had been finished they would have been the most seaworthy monitors in the US Navy. One was scrapped in 1874 while the other three were disposed of a decade later.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were frequently}} politicised, {{either by the}} debates over <b>their</b> <b>construction</b> and design, or by the symbolism incorporated into them.

5|$|Argentina placed {{orders for}} Moreno and its only sister ship, , in reply to a Brazilian naval {{building}} program. During <b>their</b> <b>construction,</b> the two dreadnoughts {{were subject to}} numerous rumors involving Argentina selling the two battleships to a country engaged in the First World War, but these proved to be false. After Moreno was completed in March 1915, a series of engine problems occurred during the sea trials which delayed its delivery to Argentina to May 1915. The next decade saw the ship based in Puerto Belgrano {{as part of the}} Argentine Navy's First Division before sailing to the United States for an extensive refit in 1924 and 1925. During the 1930s the ship was occupied with diplomatic cruises to Brazil, Uruguay, and Europe until the Second World War broke out. During this time, Moreno was employed little as Argentina was neutral. Decommissioned in 1949, Moreno was scrapped in Japan beginning in 1957.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of all these processes, large numbers of memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and <b>their</b> <b>construction</b> stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials to the events of World War I, mainly as {{a result of}} the devastation of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in <b>their</b> <b>construction</b> contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including <b>their</b> <b>construction</b> by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E

Bids were solicited only for Battleship No. 35, Texas, on 27 September 1910, while Battleship No. 34, New York, was to be built by New York Navy Yard. Bids opened for No. 35 on 1 December. Ultimately Newport News Shipbuilding Company won the contract with a bid of $5,830,000. Battleship No. 35 began construction first, on 17 April 1911, launched 18 May 1912, and completed on 12 March 1914.

40|$|This article investigates how voters {{made sense}} of the Dutch EU {{constitutional}} referendum. Based {{on a series of}} focus group interviews, it identifies what information people based their understandings on, and traces the relations they draw between concepts in their own accounts of their vote choices. Applying a cognitive connectionist perspective on the construction of meaning, it models people’s considerations as paths across semantic networks. It finds that people shared considerable parts of the knowledge underlying <b>their</b> <b>constructions,</b> but used this information quite differently. They strategically selected frames from their information environment, and reframed contrary arguments to fit <b>their</b> <b>constructions.</b> Yes- and No-voters drew in systematically different additional information, while simultaneously engaging idiosyncratic concerns to personalize their accounts. People’s understandings are thus informed and constrained, but by no means determined, by public discourse.
