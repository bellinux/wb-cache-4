5|$|The 2008 Super Tuesday tornado {{outbreak}} was {{a deadly}} tornado outbreak which affected the Southern United States {{and the lower}} Ohio Valley on February 5 and 6, 2008. The event began on Super Tuesday, while 24U.S. states were holding primary elections and caucuses to select <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> for the upcoming presidential election. Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Alabama, and Tennessee were among the affected regions in which primaries were being held. Some voting locations were forced to close early due to the approaching severe weather.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E

On September 29, 2011, the entire schedule of caucuses and primaries was disrupted, however, when it was announced that the Republican Party of Florida had decided to move up its primary to January 31, in an attempt to bring attention to its own primary contest, and attract <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> to visit the state.|$|E

50|$|Vice-President Solomon Berewa {{was chosen}} as <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> of <b>the</b> ruling SLPP, {{as well as the}} party's leader, in early September 2005. The {{incumbent}} president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of the SLPP, was prohibited from running again by term limits. On July 2, 2007, Foreign Minister Momodu Koroma was named as the party's vice-presidential candidate. Ernest Bai Koroma was nominated as <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> of <b>the</b> main opposition party APC, with Samuel Sam-Sumana as his vice-presidential candidate. Charles Margai was nominated as <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> of <b>the</b> People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC), with Ibrahim Tejan-Jalloh as his vice-presidential candidate. Margai formed the PMDC as a split from the SLPP in 2005, and this was seen as weakening the latter party.

50|$|<b>The</b> vice <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> {{might also}} be chosen {{on the basis of}} traits <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> is {{perceived}} to lack, or on the basis of name recognition. To foster party unity, popular runners-up in <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> nomination process are commonly considered. While this selection process may enhance the chances of success for a national ticket, in the past it often insured that <b>the</b> vice <b>presidential</b> nominee represented regions, constituencies, or ideologies at odds with those of <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate.</b> As a result, vice presidents were often excluded from the policy-making process of the new administration. Many times their relationships with the president and his staff were aloof, non-existent, or even adversarial.|$|R
25|$|The Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy {{conducted}} a study of 5,374 media narratives and assertions about <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> from January 1 through March 9, 2008. The study found that Obama received 69% favorable coverage and Clinton received 67%, compared to only 43% favorable media coverage of McCain. Another study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University found the media coverage of Obama to be 72% negative from June 8 to July 21 compared to 57% negative for McCain. An October 29 study found 29% of stories about Obama to be negative, compared to 57% of stories about McCain being negative.|$|E
25|$|In August 2006, the Democratic National Committee {{adopted a}} {{proposal}} by its Rules and Bylaws Committee stating {{that only the}} four states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina would be permitted to hold primaries or caucuses before February 5, 2008. In May 2007, the Florida Legislature passed a bill that moved {{the date of the}} state's primary to January 29, 2008, setting up a confrontation with the DNC. In response, the DNC ruled that Florida's 185pledged delegates and 26superdelegates would not be seated at the Democratic National Convention, or, if seated, {{would not be able to}} vote. In October 2007, Democrats from Florida's congressional delegation filed a federal lawsuit against the DNC to force a recognition of its delegates, but the suit was unsuccessful. <b>The</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> promised not to campaign in Florida.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} clear Taft would be renominated, Roosevelt and his {{supporters}} bolted the party; the former president asked Borah to chair the organizational meeting of his new Progressive Party, but the Idahoan refused. Borah would not countenance leaving the Republican Party and did not support any of <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> (the Democrats nominated New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson). [...] When Roosevelt came to Boise on a campaign swing in October, Borah {{felt he had to}} greet the former president and sit on the platform as Roosevelt spoke, though he was unwilling to endorse him. [...] Roosevelt told in his speech of a long list of state delegate votes he said had been stolen from him, and after each, turned to Borah and asked, [...] "Isn't that so, Senator Borah?" [...] giving him no choice but to nod. [...] It is not clear whether Borah voted for Roosevelt or Taft, he later stated both at different times. The main issue in Idaho was Borah's re-election, which was so popular that those disgruntled at the senator for not supporting Taft or Roosevelt kept quiet. Idahoans helped elect Wilson, but sent 80 Republican legislators out of 86 to Boise (with two of the six Democrats pledged to support Borah if necessary), who on January 14, 1913 returned William Borah for a second term.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} Democratic primary debate, <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidates</b> {{were asked whether}} black lives matter or all lives matter.

[...] In response, Hillary Clinton pushed for criminal justice reform, and said, [...] "We need a new New Deal for communities of color." [...] Jim Webb, on the other hand, replied: [...] "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters." [...] Hillary Clinton was not directly asked the same question, but was instead asked: [...] "What would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?" [...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws". Without policy change, she felt [...] "we'll be back here in 10 years having the same conversation." [...] In June 2015, Clinton used the phrase [...] "all lives matter" [...] in a speech about the opportunities of young people of color, prompting backlash that she may misunderstand the message of [...] "Black Lives Matter" ...|$|E

[...] From its inception, the Waldorf was always a [...] "must stay" [...] hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him.
