5|$|After Kaga left Nintendo, {{he founded}} a studio called Tirnanog and began {{development}} on a game titled Emblem Saga, a strategy role-playing {{game for the}} PlayStation. The game bore multiple similarities to the Fire Emblem series, and Nintendo {{filed a lawsuit against}} Tirnanog for copyright infringement. The first suit failed, and the court ruled in Tirnanog's favor. Nintendo filed a second lawsuit, and this time was awarded a cash settlement of ¥76 million. Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain were still allowed to publish the title, though <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> its name to Tear Ring Saga, and eventually developed a sequel. Nintendo attempted taking a third lawsuit to the Japanese Supreme Court in 2005, but the second ruling was upheld.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the {{different}} band members then worked part-time jobs {{along with the}} rest of their work with the band. After continuous gigging around the Midlands, it wasn't long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. The band then sent out a one track demo cd of Bullets, earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see them play at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> their band name to Editors.|$|E

5|$|Gojira {{was formed}} in 1996 by Joe and Mario Duplantier, Christian Andreu, and Alexandre Cornillon in their {{hometown}} of Ondres. Gojira's music combines elements of death metal, groove metal, thrash metal, and progressive metal. The band started touring and recording under the name Godzilla and released their demos Victim, Possessed, Saturate, and Wisdom Comes in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, respectively. After touring, supporting Cannibal Corpse, Edge of Sanity, Impaled Nazarene, and Immortal in September 1999, legal problems forced Godzilla to change their name. <b>They</b> <b>changed</b> their name to Gojira, the rōmaji spelling of the fictional monster Godzilla. Their debut album Terra Incognita was released under the new name in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Kentucky {{had wanted}} {{the jury to}} force NASCAR to grant the {{speedway}} a Sprint Cup Series event but in 2007 <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> their demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC.

In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make their case. Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} was successful, as the club {{narrowly}} won the Lancashire League title on goal average, over Blackpool. They {{also won the}} Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 to replace them. Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, {{mainly because of the}} resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division. Liverpool's original strip had been blue and white chequered shirts and white shorts, similar to those of their neighbours Everton. From 1894 <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> to red shirts and white shorts.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile Erika 'Rika' Wallen, born Lovisa Erika Jakobson in 1874 on a {{farm near}} Örebro Sweden, immigrated with her sister in 1891 to the United States. They {{traveled}} to Minneapolis, Minnesota to join their brother Carl Jakobson. There <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> their last name to Wallen to distinguish themselves from the many other Jacobsons and Jakobsons. After Carl died in an accident, the sisters moved to San Francisco, which they heard was booming. Rika {{took a job as}} a cook for the Hills Brothers coffee family, which lasted until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Recorded in Los Angeles with {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada. By design, the album lacks the production values of the band's debut album, Hello Master, {{in order to achieve}} a more natural sound. As the band took more progressive rock influences and applied them to their songwriting, <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> their lyrical focus and wrote about themes considered to be more unusual for rock music, such as film and television characters, for this album.|$|E
5|$|The Jags {{flirted with}} a number of colour schemes in their early years. From their {{inception}} until 1900 the kits were predominantly blue with red and white trimmings. There was then a brief period in which the players wore an orange and black striped top with white shorts and black socks. This was replaced in 1905 by a colour scheme close to that used by Aston Villa, before the club reverted to the predominantly blue kits in 1909. In season 1936–37 <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> to, and settled upon, the red-yellow-and-black attire for which they are best known, this change having been triggered initially by the club borrowing kits from the local rugby union team, West of Scotland Football Club.|$|E

5|$|Valley Parade, {{also known}} as the Northern Commercials Stadium through {{sponsorship}} rights, is an all-seater football stadium in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1886, and was the home of Manningham Rugby Football Club until 1903, when <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> code from rugby football to association football and became Bradford City. It has been Bradford City's home since, although it is now owned by former chairman Gordon Gibb's pension fund. It has also been home to Bradford (Park Avenue) for one season, and Bradford Bulls rugby league side for two seasons, as well as host to a number of England youth team fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. <b>They</b> <b>changed</b> their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, the Patriots {{had some}} success, earning a berth {{to the playoffs}} in 1976—as a wild card team—and in 1978—as AFC East champions. They lost {{in the first round}} both times. In 1985, they {{returned}} to the playoffs, and made {{it all the way to}} Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46–10. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1–15. <b>They</b> <b>changed</b> ownership three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis, Missouri (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 to its current owner Robert Kraft.|$|E
