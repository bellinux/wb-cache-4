5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B.

The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. <b>The</b> <b>flare</b> and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} source {{properties}} of X-class soft X-ray flares {{that were not}} associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). All <b>the</b> <b>flares</b> were associated with intense microwave bursts implying the production of high energy electrons. However, most (85 %) of <b>the</b> <b>flares</b> were not associated with metric type III bursts, even though open field lines existed in {{all but two of}} the active regions. <b>The</b> X-class <b>flares</b> seem to be truly confined because there was no material ejection (thermal or nonthermal) away from <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> region...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that the emission of microwave zebra pattern (ZP) structures requires high density and high temperatures, {{which is similar to}} the situation of <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> region where primary energy releases. Therefore, the parameters analysis of ZPs may reveal the physical conditions of <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> source region. This work investigates the variations of 74 microwave ZP structures observed by Chinese Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometer (SBRS/Huairou) at 2. 6 - 3. 8 GHz in 9 solar flares, and found that the ratio between the plasma density scale height LN and the magnetic field scale height LB in emission source displays a tendency of decrease during <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> processes. <b>The</b> ratio LN/LB is about 3 - 5 before <b>the</b> maximum of <b>flares.</b> It decreases to about 2 after the maximum. The detailed analysis of three typical X-class <b>flares</b> implied that <b>the</b> variation of LN/LB during <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> process is most likely due to the topological changes of the magnetic field in <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> source region, and the step-wise decrease of LN/LB possibly reflects the magnetic field relaxation relative to the plasma density when <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> energy released. This result may also constrain <b>the</b> solar <b>flare</b> modeling to some extent. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|The long gamma-ray burst GRB 060714 was {{observed}} to exhibit {{a series of}} five X-ray flares beginning {approx} 70 s after the burst trigger T{sub 0 } and continuing until {approx} T{sub 0 } + 200 s. <b>The</b> first two <b>flares</b> were detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on the Swift satellite, before Swift had slewed to the burst location, while <b>the</b> last three <b>flares</b> were strongly detected by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) but only weakly detected by the BAT. This burst provides an unusual opportunity to track a complete sequence of flares over a wide energy range. <b>The</b> <b>flares</b> were very similar in their light curve morphology, showing power-law rise and fall components, {{and in most cases}} significant sub-structure. <b>The</b> <b>flares</b> also showed strong evolution with time, both spectrally and temporally. The small time scale and large amplitude variability observed are incompatible with an external shock origin for <b>the</b> <b>flares,</b> and support instead late time sporadic activity either of the central source or of localized dissipation events within the outflow. We show that <b>the</b> <b>flares</b> in GRB 060714 cannot be the result of internal shocks in which the contrast in the Lorentz factor of the colliding shells is very small, and that this mechanism faces serious difficulties in most Swift GRBs.

5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. <b>The</b> <b>flare</b> accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced.

New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

25|$|A flare or decoy flare is {{an aerial}} {{infrared}} countermeasure {{used by a}} plane or helicopter to counter an infrared homing ("heat-seeking") surface-to-air missile or air-to-air missile. Flares are commonly composed of a pyrotechnic composition based on magnesium or another hot-burning metal, with burning temperature equal to or hotter than engine exhaust. The aim {{is to make the}} infrared-guided missile seek out the heat signature from <b>the</b> <b>flare</b> rather than the aircraft's engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{would then}} pull {{away at a}} sharp angle from <b>the</b> <b>flare</b> (and the terminal trajectory of the missile) and reduce engine power in attempt to cool the thermal signature. Optimally, the missile's seeker head is then confused by this change in temperature and flurry of new signatures, and therefore follows the flare(s) rather than the aircraft. The most modern IR-guided missiles have sophisticated on-board electronics that help discriminate between flares and targets, reducing the effectiveness of countermeasures.|$|E

Centers of pressure of <b>the</b> <b>flares</b> are presented and comparisons are made with results obtained from the theories mentioned.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} analysis of the four known large X-ray flares detected {{to date on the}} eclipsing binary system Algol, using an approach based on hydrodynamic simulations of decaying flaring loops including sustained heating. This method yields, for the large BeppoSAX Algol flare of Aug. 1997 (where a geometrical estimate of the size of <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> region is available) a more reliable size than approaches based on the free decay of <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> loop. For <b>the</b> three <b>flares</b> analyzed here (one observed by EXOSAT, one by GINGA and one by ROSAT) we show that indeed sustained heating is present in all cases, so that the size of <b>the</b> <b>flaring</b> region is always smaller than previously derived.
