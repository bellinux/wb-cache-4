500|$|The {{success of}} the first conference {{prompted}} the announcement of a second ISMB conference {{at the end of}} the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in Seattle. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make progress, there has to be more focus in biology." ...|$|E
500|$|Licciardello {{stated that}} they did not know they had entered the red zone, and [...] "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone. You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E
2500|$|As the Nintendo 64 {{reached the}} end of its lifecycle, {{hardware}} development chief Genyo Takeda repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word hansei ( [...] "reflective regret"). Looking back, Takeda said [...] "When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong. We now understand it's the cruising speed that matters, not the momentary flash of peak power".|$|E

2500|$|Explaining why Leskov had not {{yet come}} into his own with English-speaking readers, {{in spite of the}} admiration for him of some English critics, like Maurice Baring, Mirsky wrote in 1926: [...] "The Anglo-Saxon public have made up their minds as to what they want from a Russian writer, and Leskov does not fit into that idea. But those who really {{want to know more about}} Russians sooner or later {{recognize}} that Russia is not all contained in Dostoyevsky and Chekhov, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know anything, you must first be free of prejudice and on your guard against hasty generalizations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{supported}} Aristide and Lavalas {{during the years}} of the Cédras regime, like many other Haitians, Morse began to grow disillusioned with the nation's president and his new political party, Fanmi Lavalas. [...] Aristide aides approached the band to first request songs favorable to the government and later threaten the band when Morse refused. [...] In 1998, Manno Charlemagne, the newly elected Fanmi Lavalas mayor of Port-au-Prince and himself an accomplished professional musician who had lived in exile during the Cédras junta, sent armed men to the Oloffson. [...] They dismantled the float on which RAM was scheduled to perform in the upcoming annual Carnival on February 24. [...] The mayor had taken offense to the lyrics of one of the band's songs, which he interpreted as an accusation of corruption. [...] After the destruction of the float, the band was told they would be allowed to perform on a flatbed truck. [...] However, the brakes on the truck were sabotaged and during the Carnival procession, the truck swerved into the crowd, killing eight and forcing the members of the band to flee for their lives. [...] In 2000, Morse stated in an interview that [...] "The precedent has been set <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be involved in politics in this country, you've got to get your guns together... Nothing's changed, the teams have changed but not the modus operandi." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Jeffries from Allmusic noted Diddy's [...] "unfiltered self" [...] and [...] "unique attitude", stating [...] "This hook-filled, vibrant {{effort is}} that rare heartbreak album that can speak on a lovelorn level {{and then put}} a little strut back in your step." [...] Matt Sayles from The Boston Globe complimented its concept and praised the mixture of R vocals from Dirty Money and the guest {{features}} from the range of A-list friends, particularly Grace Jones stating that [...] "There’s no telling why she turns up but she sounds right {{at home on the}} thumping club anthem. [...] cameo is just one more pleasant surprise on an album full of them." [...] Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really made me feel like [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E
