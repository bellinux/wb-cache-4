5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether or not}} he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito's murder of the brother of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> loved.|$|E

5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> had loved.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E
5|$|Briam tells Kamala {{to stay in}} her quarters, but Captain Picard {{allows her}} to travel {{throughout}} the ship, with the unaffected Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) as her escort. This results in a fight nearly breaking out in Ten Forward, when Kamala begins to interact with several miners. The Ferengi seek to bribe Briam to turn Kamala over to them, but he rejects their offer. As he leaves, they attack him, causing him to fall, hit his head, and lose consciousness. The Enterprise turns the Ferengi over to the nearest starbase to stand trial, but Briam is unable {{to participate in the}} ceremony. Kamala helps Picard to take on Briam's role, and the two become close. He seeks to resist her abilities and tells her to be herself, and she explains that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> wants her to be is who she actually is.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E
5|$|Innis got {{his first}} taste of {{university}} teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22. Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and Anne (1933). Mary Quayle Innis was herself a notable economist and writer.

The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows.

Neville draws a vial of blood from <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute {{in the back of}} the lab.

They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E

The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for.

5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E
