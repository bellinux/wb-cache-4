5|$|The work, {{despite its}} attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several {{authorities}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. A few disapproved of Delaroche's choice of painting, while others disapproved of Delaroche himself, saying, in some form, that he sought the genius of Napoleon, <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inside, Davos pleads with Melisandre {{to attempt}} to resurrect Jon, {{reminding}} her of her previous miracles. Though Melisandre's faith has been shattered by Stannis Baratheon's defeat, she is reminded of her encounter with Thoros of Myr, and attempts a ritual, but seemingly <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Defeated, Melisandre, Davos, Edd and Tormund leave the room. Within moments, Jon suddenly awakens on the table.|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{earned his}} living collaborating with more {{established}} sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural {{pieces in the}} style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, St. John the Baptist Preaching.|$|E

50|$|Roman and Byzantine law made no {{room for}} the custom. The Codex and the Digesta of Justinian I include {{sections}} respectively titled De naufragiis and De incendio, ruina, naufragio rate, nave expugnata. They refer to a law of the emperor Antoninus Pius outlawing exercise of the jus naufragii. Around 500 the Breviarium Alaricianum of the Visigoths, probably following Roman law, forbade the custom. Theodoric the Great also legislated against it, but apparently <b>to</b> <b>no</b> long-term <b>avail.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After he recovers, against Man's {{insistence that}} he {{stay in the}} U.S. and {{continue}} {{his work as a}} mole, the narrator decides to accompany the exiled troops back into Vietnam.

50|$|In 1992, the Eastleigh Devils {{entered the}} British Youth American Football Association to play youth kitted {{football}} in the Coastal Conference, where newly appointed Coach, Martin Keogh joined with Coach Thorpe {{to see the}} team win their group with a 4-2 record.

50|$|In May 1924, Charles Duncan ONeal (1879-1936) led a delegation, {{comprising}} Wickham, John Beckles, J. A. Martineau and J. T. C. Ramsay, {{that called}} on the Barbados governor and requested him {{to take steps to}} ensure that the Education Board exercised its powers under the Education Act to ban child labour.

50|$|Preston {{was beaten}} by Dandenong in the 1971 VFA Grand Final, which {{remains one of}} the most {{controversial}} in football history. Field umpire Jim McMaster awarded Dandenong full-forward Jim 'Frosty' Miller a free kick before the opening bounce, resulting in a goal; Dandenong ultimately won by six points. Preston protested, and despite several opinions from leading law-makers that McMaster had <b>no</b> right <b>to</b> award the free kick because he had not officially started the game, Preston's protest proved <b>to</b> be of <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b>|$|R
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also have been accused of recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail,</b> a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{accounted}} for roughly 90 {{percent of the}} Manhattan Project's total cost. The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|Former Waffen-SS men {{who wished}} to join the Bundeswehr still faced {{heightened}} scrutiny. All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved only for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht. HIAG protested {{to the government and}} its military planners, but <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E
25|$|In 1575, French surgeon Ambroise Paré {{described}} an experiment {{to test the}} properties of the bezoar stone. At the time, the bezoar stone was deemed to be able to cure the effects of any poison, but Paré believed this was impossible. It happened that a cook at King's court was caught stealing fine silver cutlery and was sentenced to death by hanging. The cook agreed to be poisoned instead. Ambroise Paré then used the bezoar stone <b>to</b> <b>no</b> great <b>avail,</b> as the cook died in agony seven hours after taking poison. Paré had proved that the bezoar stone could not cure all poisons, contrary to popular belief at the time.|$|R

Marge finds out about the loan after she sees the IOU note, and her sisters tell her what happened.|$|E
5|$|No Major League Baseball (MLB) {{team had}} played in Cuba since March 21, 1959. Castro made {{attempts}} to lure American baseball teams back to Cuba <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> In the 1970s, George McGovern, a United States Senator, pushed {{the idea of an}} exchange of MLB and college basketball teams as a way to bridge the impasse between the two governments, similar to the ping-pong diplomacy that aided US-China relations; however, this was blocked by the United States Department of State.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{excise tax}} {{continued}} through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania. In June, Neville was burned in effigy by {{a crowd of}} about 100 people in Washington County. On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region. At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission. President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 2000 CECAFA Cup was the 24th {{edition of}} the {{football}} tournament, which involves teams from Southern and Central Africa. The matches were played in Uganda, a decision which Tanzania protested, but <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Tanzania were also banned from international football by FIFA, the world football governing body. The matches were played from 18 November to 2 December 2000. Prior to the tournament, Djibouti withdrew due to monetary difficulties, but re-entered. Sudan and Zanzibar also withdrew, but stayed out. The reasoning behind their withdrawal was unknown.|$|E
5|$|The grief of the Barker {{family was}} {{especially}} acute on February 28 and March 1 since {{those were the}} birthdays of Barker and her father, and they were planning to have a joint celebration that week. The police stated that {{they were working on}} several leads but had no developments. On Saturday, March 2, the FBI was officially called in following the provisions of the Federal Kidnapping Act.

50|$|In 1543, {{after the}} death of James V, the Earl {{successfully}} challenged the legality of his resignation before the council of Regent Arran. Morton stated that he was old and infirm and would have been unlikely to survive confinement in Inverness away from the comfort of East Lothian, and was compelled by his 'just dredour' (rightful fear) of the King with his 'menacing' and messages with 'boastful words'. He had 'quietly' had a notary draw up his objections on 29 March 1542. Arran's council declared him a 'constant man' in the face of fear and dread and the transactions were <b>to</b> have <b>no</b> <b>avail</b> in all time to come. Morton was assisted in asserting his rights in 1543 by George Douglas of Pittendreich. The historian, Jamie Cameron, suggests that the motive of James V may have been to settle the Morton heritage on his son by Margaret Erskine, James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, in the event the Earldom came to George Douglas's son.|$|R
50|$|For the Stoics, God is {{everywhere}} as the ruler and upholder, {{and at the}} same time the law, of the universe. Zeno declared cult images, shrines, temples, sacrifices, prayers and worship <b>to</b> be of <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> A really acceptable prayer, he taught, can only have reference to a virtuous and devout mind. The Stoics however attempted to defend and uphold the truth in polytheism. Not only was the primitive substance God, the one supreme being, but divinity could be ascribed to the manifestations - to the heavenly bodies, which were conceived, like Plato's created gods, as the highest of rational beings, to the forces of nature, even to deified men; and thus the world was peopled with divine agencies.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} of <b>no</b> <b>avail,</b> {{just as the}} same {{arguments}} and temper on two other occasions of the same eternal theme in his life,[263] were <b>to</b> be of <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Disraeli spoke strongly against the line taken by the Peelites. The second reading was carried by 438 against 95, one-third even of this minority being Irish catholics, and the rest mainly Peelites, 'a limited but accomplished school,' as Disraeli styled them. Hume asked Mr. Gladstone for his speech for publication to circulate among the dissenters who, he said, know nothing about religious liberty. It was something, however, to find Mr. Gladstone, the greatest living churchman, and Bright, the greatest living nonconformist, voting in the same lobby. The fight was stiff, and was kept up {{until the end of}} the summer. The weapon that had been forged in this blazing furnace by these clumsy armourers proved blunt and worthless; the law was from the first a dead letter, and it was struck out of the statute book in 1871 in Mr. Gladstone's own administration.[264] ...|$|R
