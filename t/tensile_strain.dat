500|$|They {{are widely}} used to prevent the {{oxidative}} degradation of polymers such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, are especially susceptible to oxidation and ozonolysis. They can be protected by antiozonants. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a [...] "crazy paving" [...] effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned {{at right angles to}} the <b>tensile</b> <b>strain</b> in the product. [...] Oxidation and UV degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because UV radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in low-density polyethylene.|$|E

In this work, the dilatation during <b>tensile</b> <b>straining</b> of a cast and thermomechanically processed 6061 Al - Al 2 O 3 {{metal matrix composite}} (MMC) containing 20 volume percent of Al 2 O 3 particles was examined. Standard tensile samples of the MMC and unreinforced 6061 Al were machined. Precise diameter measurements were made of both composite and unreinforced samples prior to and immediately following <b>tensile</b> <b>straining.</b> Tension tests were conducted to various strains {{as well as to}} fracture and an extensometer was employed to obtain accurate measurement of the axial strain. The MMC material exhibited a continuously increasing dilatation during <b>tensile</b> <b>straining</b> while the unreinforced 6061 control material deformed plastically at constant volume.

40|$|Fracture repair has {{previously}} {{been shown to be}} sensitive to mechanical environment, yet the specific relationship between strain character, magnitude and frequency, as well as other mechanical parameters, and tissue formation is not well understood. This study aimed to correlate strain distribution within the healing fracture gap with patterns of tissue formation using a rat model of a healing osteotomy subject to mechanical stimulation in bending. Finite element models based on realistic tissue distributions were used to estimate both the magnitude and spatial distribution of strains within the fracture gap. The spatial distribution of regenerating tissue was determined by microcomputed tomography and histology, and was confirmed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results suggest that <b>tensile</b> <b>strains</b> suppress chondrogenesis during the mechanical stimulation period. After stimulation ends, however, <b>tensile</b> <b>strains</b> increased chondrogenesis followed by rapid bone formation. In contrast, in compressive environments, bone is formed primarily via intramembranous ossification. Taken together, these results suggest that intermittent <b>tensile</b> <b>strains</b> during fracture repair stimulate endochondral ossification and promote eventual bone healing compared to intermittent compressive strains and unstimulated fractures. Further understanding of these relationships may allow proposal of optimal therapeutic strategies for improvement of the fracture repair process. © 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

50|$|The {{appearance}} of necking in ductile materials {{is associated with}} geometrical instability in the system. Due to the natural inhomogeneity of the material, {{it is common to}} find some regions with small inclusions or porosity within it or surface, where strain will concentrate, leading to a locally smaller area than other regions. For strain less than the ultimate <b>tensile</b> <b>strain,</b> the increase of work-hardening rate in this region will be greater than the area reduction rate, thereby make this region harder to be further deform than others, so that the instability will be removed, i.e. the materials have abilities to weaken the inhomogeneity before reaching ultimate strain. However, as the strain become larger, the work hardening rate will decreases, so that for now the region with smaller area is weaker than other region, therefore reduction in area will concentrate in this region and the neck becomes more and more pronounced until fracture. After the neck has formed in the materials, further plastic deformation is concentrated in the neck while the remainder of the material undergoes elastic contraction owing to the decrease in tensile force.|$|E
