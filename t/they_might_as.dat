5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; {{and if it was}} not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E
25|$|After the {{termination}} of his racing relationship with STP-March, Hunt joined the Hesketh team, where he {{was seen as a}} kindred spirit. The team initially entered Hunt in Formula Two with little success but Lord Hesketh announced that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well fail in F1 as in F2, as it wasn't significantly more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Work on this {{technology}} continued {{and a new}} step was taken in 1833. The Royal Edward managed to cross the Atlantic by using steam power on three-quarter of the course. The sail was used only when {{the wall of the}} boilers was cleaned. However, there were still many skeptics, and in 1836, scientific writer Dionysius Lardner declared that: As the project of making the voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, it was perfectly chimerical, and <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well talk of making the voyage from New York to the moon.|$|E

25|$|Unlike, for example, the Market Portal of the Mainz Cathedral, the {{identity}} of the artist responsible for the Bernward Doors is not preserved. As a result, older research attempted to identify a varying number of different artists on the basis of stylistic analysis of the individual panels. Rainer Kahsnitz has since put these attributions in doubt, since the differences in execution between the reliefs is so marginal that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> easily be the result of technical requirements as different artistic styles. Probably a single artist was responsible for the creation of the Bernward Doors, {{with a small group of}} apprentices and assistants.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of an adventurer called Andriscus, Macedon rebelled against Roman rule in 149 BC: as a result it was directly annexed the following year and became a Roman province, {{the first of the}} Greek states to suffer this fate. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and, feeling that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well die fighting, declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Ian Redpath and Wally Edwards saw {{off the new}} {{ball and}} were 1/0 at stumps on the first day. The next day Bob Willis (2/91) hit Edwards with a bouncer and appealed for Redpath caught behind off his gloves, which was {{declined}} by the umpire. They took the score to 64 runs {{in less than an}} hour when Edwards hit Tony Greig to David Lloyd at cover-point. The usually static Redpath was stumped when he danced down the wicket to Fred Titmus (2/84) and Ian Chappell edged Geoff Arnold (2/129) to Alan Knott while trying to leg glance, leaving Australia 113/3. Greg Chappell made 62, his fifth successive 50 against the tourists and added 79 runs with Ross Edwards by tea, though Titmus conceded only 20 runs in nine 8-ball overs. Chappell was out at 192/4 when he cut Willis into the gully where Colin Cowdrey knocked the ball up to be caught by Greig. After tea Doug Walters came out and took command of the game as Denness declined to use Willis to attack his well-known weakness around the off stump. Instead Greig sent up his slow off-cutters and gave away 69 runs off nine overs. Walters reached his 50 in 44 minutes, followed by that of Edwards in 174 minutes. The English fielding became ragged as they added 158 runs after tea. Walters reached his century off the last ball of the day by pulling Willis for six and was engulfed by fans as he left the field, as well <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> he was the first batsman since Bradman to score a hundred runs in a session in an Ashes Test. Australia were 352/4 and well ahead in the game, but the Australian team played a trick on Walters when he returned, hiding in the showers before coming out to congratulate him. He was out first thing the next day, caught by Fletcher in the gully off Willis waving his bat outside off-stump for 103, but Edwards stayed in to make 115, having been 79 overnight and became the first Western Australian to make a hundred at the WACA. He was bowled by Arnold, but Rod Marsh hit 41 and the tail added 65 runs before Chris Old cleared things up with 3/85. Australia made 481, a lead of 273 in the first innings and few thought England could avoid an innings defeat.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the film}} met with mixed {{reactions}} from other critics. Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com gave the film a positive review, but commented, [...] "When you strip the 007 films down for action and 'realism,' {{you lose the}} soul of those old beloved Bond movies – <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well be Jason Bourne movies." [...] John Beifuss of The Commercial Appeal said, [...] "Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, {{as if he were}} Greg Brady in his 'Johnny Bravo' phase?" [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker criticised the more imperfect and self-aware depiction of the character, saying, [...] "Even James Bond, in other words, wants to be 007." ...|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E
500|$|With McCulloch {{influenced}} by American alternative rock bands such as Nirvana and The Smashing Pumpkins, the group employed a heavier sound than Echo & the Bunnymen's previous work. After successfully touring the United Kingdom {{and refusing to}} play any Echo & the Bunnymen material, Electrafixion released their only album, Burned, in September 1995. Despite critics giving the album good reviews, sales {{of it and the}} follow-up singles were disappointing. After embarking {{on a tour of the}} United States in 1996, Electrafixion eventually gave in to fan pressure and began to introduce Echo & the Bunnymen material to their live set. Sergeant felt that as the band were playing Echo & the Bunnymen songs, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well reform Echo & the Bunnymen; however, McCulloch was initially opposed to the idea. McCulloch changed his mind and, having persuaded Pattinson to come out of retirement, Echo & the Bunnymen was reformed in mid-1996. McCulloch felt Echo & the Bunnymen could not reform without Pattinson and described the bassist's involvement as [...] "integral". McCulloch went on to say it was important to [...] "feel like the original group". He has also said, [...] "Right from the first demo [...] we realised that we'd still got that chemistry." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Barron {{expressed}} his disaffection from the Democratic Party, {{disappointed by the}} large number of cross-endorsements Bloomberg received from Democrats. He said the Party was in need of a [...] "political audit" [...] and had [...] "moved so far to the right that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well be called Republicrats." [...] He told the Amsterdam News, [...] "Black folks need to consider a mass exodus from the Democratic Party and build a new party of their own, because the Democrats have turned their backs on them on too many occasions. We should not give any party blind loyalty and support. Instead, we should really form a grassroots, Black-agenda-based third-party option." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sports-related boycotts were {{proposed}} as well. [...] U.S. Congressman from New York José Serrano asked baseball commissioner Bud Selig {{to move the}} 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game from Chase Field in Phoenix. [...] The manager of the Chicago White Sox, Ozzie Guillén, stated that he would boycott that game [...] "as a Latin American" [...] and several players indicated <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well. [...] Selig refused to move the game and it took place as scheduled a year later, with no players or coaches staying away. Two groups protesting outside the stadium drew little interest from fans eager {{to get into the}} game. [...] The World Boxing Council, based in Mexico City, said it would not schedule Mexican boxers to fight in the state.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first scene}} {{appears at the}} very {{beginning}} of the movie, and features the classic [...] "Looney Tunes" [...] opening card, causing people to assume it is the short cartoon that usually plays before a movie begins; however, when Bugs Bunny appears through the rings on top of the Warner Brothers shield, Daffy interrupts the intro, and steals the shield from Bugs. Daffy attempts to recreate the opening with himself in place of Bugs Bunny, but the shield overshoots, causing the entire title card to fall apart. Daffy surrenders the stardom, claiming that since he won't star in the cartoon, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well just skip straight to the movie. Bugs is willing to do so, and spins Daffy off screen like a spinning top for the movie title to appear.|$|E

2500|$|Its {{composition}} was not, however, {{a departure}} from Murdoch's interpretation of the [...] "women and children first" [...] directive. He had already allowed several married couples and single men to board lifeboats. Cosmo Duff Gordon had been standing on deck {{with his wife and}} her secretary, Miss Laura Mabel Francatelli, watching the launching of three other lifeboats when, as Boat 1 was being prepared, he asked Murdoch if his party could board. Murdoch assented and also allowed two Americans, Abram Salomon and Charles E. H. Stengel, to enter. He then instructed a group of six stokers to board, along with Lookout Symons, whom he placed in charge of the boat. As the craft was lowered, Greaser Walter Hurst, watching the procedure from a lower deck, remarked to a crewmate: [...] "If they are sending the boats away <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well put some people in them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the album's release T.I. {{decided to}} release a mixtape titled Fuck a Mixtape; the move was {{somewhat}} controversial due to its title, with many feeling he was insulting the Mixtape format. T.I. has addressed the issue by stating {{that it was a}} response to all the people who told him to just focus on an album and not on a mixtape. T.I. further defended his decision {{to release a}} mixtape by saying: [...] "I already have 60, 70 songs. A lot of these songs are period pieces that speak volumes to what's going on right now. If I hold onto them next year or the year after, they'll be dated, because my life will be in another direction. If I'm not gonna put it on the album — and they all can't make the album — then <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well have another platform to present it to the world".|$|E
2500|$|Huhne {{was an avid}} {{supporter}} of Professor David Nutt after he was dismissed by Home Secretary Alan Johnson {{as chairman of the}} Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in November 2009. Nutt had criticised the government's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug rather than keeping it as a class C. Huhne said the decision to sack Nutt was [...] "disgraceful" [...] and commented: [...] "what is the point of having independent scientific advice if {{as soon as you get}} some advice that you don't like, you sack the person who has given it to you?". Attacking the government, he said that if they did not want to take expert scientific advice <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well have a [...] "committee of tabloid newspaper editors to advise on drugs policy". Cannabis had been re-classified as a class C drug in 2004 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett, only for Jacqui Smith to reverse the ruling in 2008, a decision taken despite official advisers recommending against it.|$|E
