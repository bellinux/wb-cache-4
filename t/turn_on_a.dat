5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E

25|$|In 1899 a Daimler 6hp was {{involved}} in the first motor accident in the UK to be recorded as having involved the death of the driver. A young engineer was killed when the rim of a rear wheel of the car he was driving collapsed under heavy braking in a <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sloping road in Harrow on the Hill. The driver and his four passengers were thrown from the car. One of the passengers fractured his skull in the accident and died in hospital three days later.|$|E
25|$|The SRTV has a {{range of}} up to 350 miles, and can operate in {{difficult}} environmental conditions, and including at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above mean sea level. The vehicle can travel at a speed over 100mph and climb vertical grades over 70 degrees, move on side slopes angles of over 60 degrees and climb vertical steps over three feet. It can <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 20' (6.1 m) diameter curb to curb. Maneuverability is enhanced with cutting brakes allowing U-turns on steep hills within the length and width of the vehicle, also allowing high speed J-turns. The vehicle provides rollover safety for all occupants without limiting mission operational performance. Storm can carry up to three liters inside the rollover protection frame, without modifications, while still maintaining 360° of weapon field of fire.|$|E

25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

[...] Zoromski {{went on to say}} that the acting of John Krasinski and Rashida Jones, who portrays Karen Filippelli, helped to make the vampire scenes the funniest parts of the episode. He gave the episode a 9.1 out of 10.

He noted that Jack's storyline was the [...] "simplest recipe for comedy: just <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> camera and let Alec Baldwin be hilarious.

He called it [...] "an intense watch from start to finish" [...] and said [...] "it's the episode which undoubtedly packs the biggest emotional punch". Page elected it the fourth best among the thirteen episodes, asserting that it has an [...] "ability to truly disturb" [...] and [...] "has put off many a viewer as spinning on a cheap twist, but {{despite the fact that}} the episode's impact does <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> reveal, there's little in the episode that even feels remotely done before." [...] Mat Elfring of GameSpot placed it fifth out of thirteen, labelling it [...] "the most successful horror episode [...] to date". Atad ranked it seven out of thirteen, saying it [...] "begins a dystopian horror reminiscent of 28 Days Later, but where it ends up is far more disturbing". Out of the thirteen, Hibberd ranked it eighth, highlighting its plot twist and noting that [...] "most [...] rank this episode much higher; I just happened to like the rest of the episodes better".

500|$|Thomas Newman {{composed}} the film's original score. In regards to incorporating his own musical style to the film's period setting, Newman stated that [...] "there was {{room for a}} real tune-based score here that could reflect the basic joy {{in that kind of}} writing that the Sherman Brothers brought to Mary Poppins. Newman, however, refrained from creating an [...] "adaptation score" [...] of the Shermans' music from the original film. Newman's process of scoring the film included playing themes to filmed scenes, so that he could [...] "listen to what the music does to an image", and not wanting to [...] "clutter the proceedings with music." [...] The flashback sequences to Travers' childhood provided the most work for Newman. He explains that, [...] "You had to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dime to make the transition back to the 'present,' when Travers and the Sherman brothers are working on the script for Mary Poppins. And that was fun, but also musically challenging.” For the score's instrumentation, Newman primarily employed a string orchestra with some woodwinds and brass, as well as including piano and hammered instruments that were [...] "appropriate to the time period", such as dulcimers. The film's score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, while the cast recorded several of the Shermans' songs at Capitol Studios for use as playback during the film's diegetic music scenes, including [...] "Chim Chim Cher-ee", [...] "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", [...] "A Spoonful of Sugar", [...] "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank", [...] "Feed the Birds", and [...] "Let's Go Fly a Kite". Walt Disney Records released two editions of the soundtrack on December 10, 2013: a single-disc and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, containing original demo recordings by the Shermans and selected songs from Mary Poppins.|$|E
