According to Rutgers, <b>this</b> <b>window</b> was a gift of the Tiffany studios. Weston, the grandson of Henry Latimer Janeway (1824–1909)a wealthy wallpaper manufacturer, Rutgers alumnus (A.B. 1844, A.M. 1847) and long-serving trustee (1862–1909)killed himself after his family became aware of a romantic relationship with a woman that would have negatively affected his reputation.|$|E

To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and {{the entrance to the}} oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower. The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall.

25|$|The chancel is lit by four windows all c.1883. On {{the east}} wall the five-light window depicts the Ascension. On the north wall {{there are two}} two-light windows; one depicts {{the parable of the}} Good Samaritan and the other St Peter and St Paul. The lancet window on the south wall is of the Virgin Mary. <b>This</b> <b>window</b> was the gift of clergy of the Deanery and is by Mr Drake of Exeter. The other three windows are by Lavers and Westlake of London.|$|E
25|$|The east window {{has been}} {{restored}} with glass from 1887. There are two windows in the north wall of the chancel; the eastern is mid-14th-century but the western is earlier, from the 13th century. The south wall has two windows, the eastern corresponding to {{the window in the}} north wall. The other is a low side window of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed light, set in a wide 14th-century recess. <b>This</b> <b>window</b> was probably unglazed with a wooden shutter and may have been used as a sanctus window through which the sanctus bell was rung at the Elevation of the host.|$|E

25|$|All {{windows are}} lancets. The {{three in the}} north {{transept}} are very tall and have two quatrefoils above, while in the south transept two narrower windows with intricate tracery are separated by a thick mullion. There is also a quatrefoil and a sexfoil (six-lobed round window) in this wall. The aisles have three-light lancet windows, {{and there is a}} large lancet topped by a quatrefoil in the west wall of the nave. The Heaton, Butler and Bayne glass firm designed the stained glass in <b>this</b> <b>window</b> in 1892. Each lancet in the apse is separated by a thin stone shaft inside and out. This feature was copied from St Barnabas Church, Hove.|$|E
25|$|The south {{transept}} rose (10.5m diameter, made c.1225–30) {{is dedicated}} to Christ, who {{is shown in the}} central oculus, right hand raised in benediction, surrounded by adoring angels. Two outer rings of twelve circles each contain the 24 Elders of the Apocalypse, crowned and carrying phials and musical instruments. The central lancet beneath the rose shows the Virgin carrying the infant Christ. Either side of this are four lancets showing the four evangelists sitting on the shoulders of four Prophets – a rare literal illustration of the theological principle that the New Testament builds upon the Old Testament. <b>This</b> <b>window</b> was a donation of the Mauclerc family, the Counts of Dreux-Bretagne, who are depicted with their arms in the bases of the lancets.|$|E
25|$|The window, {{designed}} and installed by the Blum Art Company of Louisville in 1883, depicts the crowning of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven. It {{is one of}} the oldest American-made stained glass windows. <b>This</b> <b>window,</b> in the early half of the 20th century had been moved to the front of the tower, with a new Assumption window replacing it. During restoration, the windows were switched to place the Coronation window in its original place in the sanctuary. It was in this crane-operated delicate process that the building was cracked, temporarily halting all work. Conrad Schmitt Studios conserved the historic glass and restored the original appearance of the windows by painting the missing artwork on 2mm slide glass and sandwiching them to the conserved glass before re-leading.|$|E
