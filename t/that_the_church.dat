5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, it is more likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|In the 1989 form nominating {{it for the}} National Register of Historic Places, it {{was noted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> had {{undergone}} only minor alterations, including an interior redecoration in 1964, the replacement of roof slates with asphalt shingles in 1977, {{and the addition of}} a concrete ramp for access by the handicapped in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Kimball's {{presidency}} saw large {{growth in}} the LDS Church, {{both in terms of}} membership and the number of temples.

50|$|According to Robert Massie, {{during the}} proceedings, Nikon staunchly defended his belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church's</b> {{authority}} and power were {{and ought to}} be supreme.

5|$|The Catholic Church is {{the largest}} non-government {{provider}} of education and medical services in the world. In 2010, the Catholic Church's Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> manages 26% of health care facilities in the world, including hospitals, clinics, orphanages, pharmacies and centres for those with leprosy.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also makes it clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated {{from the time of}} Aldfrith's death.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the history}} of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has {{committed}} itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution {{in a number of}} German Länder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|In April 1990, he {{arranged}} {{for several hundred}} Asháninka to make a five-day trek from the central highlands into the mountains of Peru at Tzibokiroato. During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where they questioned his arming the Asháninka, because of {{the view that the}} Catholic Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> had resorted to the use of violence in the past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E

50|$|In August 2013, three New Hope {{churches and}} two others were sued by a group alleging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> underpaid for <b>the</b> use of school facilities. <b>The</b> suit claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> five <b>churches</b> collectively underpaid by $5.6 million, of which New Hope Oahu alone was {{responsible}} for $3.2 million {{over the course of}} six years.|$|R
5|$|It is {{recorded}} in Domesday that a priest was resident in Ashby, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> dedicated to St Helen consisted only of a nave. In about 1144, Philip Beaumais, {{lord of the}} Manor of Ashby, granted the church, its lands and revenues to the Augustinian community of Lilleshall Abbey, which retained possession until 1538. A 2013 excavation found evidence of a two-storey vicarage dating from this period, but the building fell into disrepair following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the site was cleared in the English Civil War of 1642–49.|$|E
5|$|Seddon thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> {{had once}} been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Stark {{attributes}} {{the rise of}} the movement in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often fared better without medical treatment, Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison. Other factors included <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting its terms, despite the new content Eddy introduced. It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to drink or smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.|$|E

5|$|The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was {{supposedly}} founded in about 605 by St Eugrad.

St Gallgo's and St Eugrad's have been in the same parish since at least 1253.|$|E
5|$|The Church of the SubGenius' founders {{were based}} in Dallas when they {{distributed}} their first document. The SubGenius Foundation moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1999.

5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants {{that there should be a}} single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E

5|$|The Patriarchal Cathedral was {{destroyed}} after the Ottomans captured the Bulgarian capital after their Siege of Tarnovo on 17 July 1393. The church was fully reconstructed in the 20th century; reconstruction works {{were carried out}} by a team under architect Boyan Kuzupov. These commenced in 1978 and were finished in 1981, to mark Bulgaria's 1300th anniversary. However, {{it was not until}} November 1985, when the contemporary murals were finished, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was opened once again for visitors. The church's ruins have been protected as a national antiquity since 1927; in 1967, they were proclaimed an architectural monument of culture of national importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built on the Bronze Age puddingstone circle, which has been {{incorporated}} into {{the foundations of the}} church. Built of knapped flint with limestone dressings, it has a roughly cruciform shape. The present day church building comprises a chancel, a clerestoried nave, north and south aisles and transepts and a south porch with a tierceron vault. The church is topped by a square central crenellated steeple with an octagonal wooden spire covered with lead. Although the current stone church of St.Mary's contains a mixture of architectural styles, mainly Gothic and dating from later periods, a Romanesque window between the north transept and north aisle has been dated to the 12th century, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was already a stone building by this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{national}} assembly of theologians to advise Parliament on further church reforms was first presented to the House of Commons in 1641. Such a proposal was {{also included in the}} Grand Remonstrance, a list of grievances which Parliament presented to Charles on 1December that year. Charles responded on 23December <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> required no reforms. Undeterred, Parliament passed three bills in 1642 appointing an assembly and stipulating that its members would be chosen by Parliament. Charles, whose royal assent was required for the bills to become law, was only willing to consider such an assembly if the members were chosen by the clergy. This was the practice for selection of members of Convocation, the assembly of clergy of the Church of England.|$|E
