5|$|A {{number of}} other CMF units {{operated}} M3 Grant medium tanks in the immediate post–war period, including the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles (8th/13th VMR) and the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse (4th/19th PWLH), before converting to Centurions. Meanwhile, {{the last of the}} Matildas were withdrawn from service with the CMF in 1955. Later, in 1956 the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers merged with the 15th Northern River Lancers to form the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers (1st/15th RNSWL), which was also equipped with a small number of Centurion tanks. The CMF armoured units were rationalised in 1957 and consequently <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> the pentropic structure in the 1960s mostly resulted in a change in role only, with the 4th/19th PWLH changing from an armoured unit to a reconnaissance regiment. However, the two CMF armoured brigade headquarters were disbanded. Following additional orders, a total of 127 Centurions had been acquired by 1961, including 117 tanks, four bridgelayers and six Armoured Recovery Vehicles.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid {{to replace the}} Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The Hunter {{remained}} in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth.

5|$|Lap 18 {{saw more}} drivers making <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> slick tyres, {{including}} Räikkönen and Palmer, but {{the latter was}} let go from his pitbox before one of the tyres was properly fitted, costing him time and handing him a ten-second stop-and-go penalty. Both Mercedes drivers and Verstappen made their second pitstops by lap 20, with the order remaining the same. On lap 21, Ricciardo moved ahead of Pérez into fourth position. A mistake by Räikkönen two laps later saw him lose sixth place to Sainz. Fernando Alonso spun on lap 25, but was able to continue, unlike Rio Haryanto, who retired following a spin one lap later. Hamilton retained the lead, but not without problems, as {{he also had a}} short excursion off the track, which was mirrored by Verstappen behind him. As a result, the top three moved closer together. Vettel was still running at the back end of the point-scoring positions, overtaking Kvyat for ninth on lap 29.|$|E

5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} form {{of government}} was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission {{form of government}} in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: This {{article focuses}} on <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> section 198 of the Labour Relations Act (LRA). Research purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the {{perceptions}} of employees regarding <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> section 198 and the potential implications of these <b>changes</b> for <b>the</b> company and its employees. Motivation for <b>the</b> study: <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> section 198 of the LRA are new and the impact of <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> a company and its employees is still unclear. Research design, approach and method: The qualitative exploratory study was conducted with six employees of a large integrated petroleum and chemical company making use of labour brokers, until data saturation was reached. The data were collected by means of individual interviews and telephonic interviews. Main findings: The results indicated that <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> section 198 have positive and negative implications for the organisation as well as its employees. The negative implications for the organisation are higher costs, new policies and guidelines, and less employment flexibility. The negative implications for the employees are unemployment, negative attitudes, poor employability, and a situation where the permanent employees have to do all the work. Practical / managerial implications: The outcome of the study can be used to develop an employment policy and dispute resolution to minimise the negative implications for the organisation and its employees. Contribution / value-add: The study represents original research, extending the current body of knowledge on the perceptions of employees in the human resources department regarding <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> section 198 of the LRA.
