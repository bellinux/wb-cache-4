25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to give <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E

[...] This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better." [...] Before the final, Digital Spy's reality television editor Alex Fletcher listed his five favourite moments from the series. His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said [...] "No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they really know the programme's stars.

500|$|In {{his book}} Britpop!, John Harris {{concluded}} that the initial negative reviews of the time missed the album's universal strengths. [...] "Those who fussed about the music's more artful aspects were missing the point. The fact that [...] songs contained so many musical echoes seemed to couch the album in an air of homely reassurance." [...] Harris believed that the [...] "ordinary" [...] nature {{of some of the}} album's songs [...] "turned out to be part of its deeply populist appeal". Rob Sheffield, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), called the album [...] "a triumph, full of bluster and bravado but also moments of surprising tenderness". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his retrospective review and gave it a two-star honorable mention, indicating a [...] "likable effort that consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." [...] He cited [...] "She's Electric" [...] and [...] "Roll with It" [...] as highlights and quipped [...] "give <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for wanting it all—and (yet another Beatles connection!) playing guitars".|$|E

500|$|Just {{before the}} Rose set sail, things were {{complicated}} {{again when the}} Crown decided to place a minder on board named John Knepp [...] "to look after the King's interest". Knepp {{seems to have been}} a purser. In the English Navy, the purser acted as a sort of Company Store, tempting sailors far from shore with whiskey, tobacco and other desirables by offering <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> against their wages, (collected through the captain). [...] It was a lucrative post and required an investment to procure, hence it usually went to young Naval clerks and scions who could afford the capital outlay. It seems like a terrible idea to place a purser on a voyage like that of the Rose, on a shoestring budget, with the men receiving no wages and collectively buying and sharing food together. [...] (Knepp brought great quantities of fancy cheese and brandy, with predictable results). But either way, the purser was dependent on good relations with the captain, yet Knepp seems to have looked down on Phips and decided to be forward in introducing himself to the crew of HMS Rose while Phips was absent in London. The reception was rather less than friendly: [...] "... then most of them began to curse the ship and wished she had been afire before they saw her and that they had better have hired a ship of merchants..."The crew were a salty bunch to say the least, a [...] "rum lot" [...] as Peter Earle calls them, and this final last-minute bait-and-switch, after the previous addition of Randolph, seems to have nearly put them over the edge. Everything we know about the crew comes from a detailed journal of the trip to Boston was kept by Knepp and he has rightly been called a [...] "hostile observer" [...] but it is more important to note that he was often ignorant of the complex, dual nature of the voyage, as well as basic colonial politics, if not some important elements of human nature. [...] Distant historians must grope for any available source to shed light on events of the past, and so history tends to be swayed heavily by the writers. Phips was never a writer and so much of his story comes from others, with Knepp's Journal at the top of this pile. Like the rest of us, Knepp does not seem to have understood the role Phips was intended to play, either in support of Randolph, or as a possible decoy and cleanup for the Falcon & Bonetta. In Knepp's first interaction, he says that he is seeking signatures between the crew and the King though the July 13 agreement (see image) would more accurately be portrayed as between Phips and the crew, as the first mate protests. [...] Knepp's job seemed to be to seek additional signatures from the crew, which is easily done when Phips returns to the ship, with Randolph acting as a witness. Next Knepp complained to Phips about the firing of the ships cannons to set the watch. By the time the ship set sail the next day, Phips and Knepp were distinctly at odds, as Knepp records when asked for a cabin or berth and was told he would have to make do sleeping on a trunk. This was an unfortunate turn of events for both of them, as well as the historian who would prefer to have Knepp at the Captain's table recording the dinner conversation between Randolph, his brother, and Phips. Class friction surely played a strong role in the conflict between Knepp and Phips. Knepp consistently presents himself as a victim and there are many times he is bullied and badly mistreated, but it also seems that he must have set himself above, and thought of himself as being of a higher class than Phips. The articles of agreement testify to the trust that the king and Narborough placed in Phips, and the crew seemed willing to do as Phips commanded, but Knepp acts as if he is not beholden to Phips. Knepp's journal is addressed to Narborough (and Haddock) and it reads like a sycophant's strong gambit for a future promotion. He presents Phips as the trope of a tarpaulin captain—every sailor his comrade, questionable literacy level—and so it is probably safe to infer that Knepp was of the gentleman class and likely some years younger than Phips, perhaps in his mid-twenties. [...] Knepp is excellent at taking coordinates and seems trained in piloting, but does not exhibit the a breadth of experience or knowledge of the rigging. [...] Though he records every perceived misstep by Phips, his careful plotting of the journey also shows the great ability Phips possessed as a sailor, crossing the Atlantic in half the time of another ship that they meet, and making first landfall at Cape Ann.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his next}} column, Sheldrake again {{attacked}} Rose for following [...] "materialism", {{and argued that}} quantum physics had [...] "overturned" [...] materialism, and suggested that [...] "memories {{may turn out to}} depend on morphic resonance rather than memory traces". [...] Philosopher Alan Malachowski of the University of East Anglia, responding to what he called Sheldrake's [...] "latest muddled diatribe", defended materialism, argued that Sheldrake dismissed Rose's explanation with an [...] "absurd rhetorical comparison", asserted that quantum physics was compatible with materialism and argued that [...] "being roughly right about great many things has given [...] the confidence to be far more open minded than he is prepared to give <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for".|$|E
2500|$|As {{understood}} by Skinner, ascribing dignity to individuals involves giving <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for their actions. To say [...] "Skinner is brilliant" [...] means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's determinist theory is right, he {{is merely the}} focus of his environment. He is not an originating force {{and he had no}} choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. J. E. R. Staddon (The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition, 2014) has argued the compatibilist position; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.|$|E
2500|$|From {{his early}} research, Sahagún wrote the text known as Primeros Memoriales. This {{served as the}} basis for his subsequent, larger Historia General. [...] He {{conducted}} his research at Tepeapulco, approximately 50miles northeast of Mexico City, near present-day Hidalgo. There he spent two years interviewing approximately a dozen village elders in Nahuatl, assisted by native graduates of the college at Tlatelolco. Sahagún questioned the elders about the religious rituals and calendar, family, economic and political customs, and natural history. He interviewed them individually and in groups, and was thus able to evaluate the reliability of the information shared with him. His assistants spoke three languages (Nahuatl, Latin and Spanish). They participated in research and documentation, translation and interpretation, and they also painted illustrations. [...] He published their names, described their work, and gave <b>them</b> <b>credit.</b> The pictures in the Primeros Memoriales convey a blend of indigenous and European artistic elements and influences. [...] Analysis of Sahagún's research activities in this earlier period indicates that he was developing and evaluating his own methods for gathering and verifying this information.|$|E

2500|$|Other than Taylor, however, {{several other}} critics also {{disagree}} with Warren's {{assessment of the}} quality of the language, arguing that the passages are more complex and accomplished than has hitherto been allowed for. Michael Taylor, for example, argues that [...] "the rhyming dialogue between the Talbots – often stichomythic – shapes a kind of noble flyting match, a competition as to who can out-oblige the other." [...] Similarly, Alexander Leggatt argues that the passages are a perfect blend of form and content: [...] "The relentless click-click of the rhymes reinforces the point that for John Talbot, all arguments are arguments for death; as every other line ending is countered by a rhyme, so every argument Talbot gives John to flee becomes an argument for staying." [...] Taylor and Leggatt are here arguing that the passages are more accomplished than most critics tend to give <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for, thus offering a counter-argument to the theory that they are so poorly written, they could not possibly be by Shakespeare. In this sense, his failure to use couplets elsewhere in a tragic passage can thus be attributed to an aesthetic choice on his part, rather than offered as evidence of co-authorship.|$|E
