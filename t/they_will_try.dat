However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to understand what he has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends.

Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine and say <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to forgive her.|$|E

Individuals may initiate claims to the commission. As of April 2016, another 130 cases have been heard of torture that was not committed by Burge or his subordinates. The city and state are struggling {{to determine how to}} treat this high number of torture victims in a just way. The sponsors of the bill tried to amend it in 2014 to expand its scope to all claims of torture by police in Chicago, but were unable to get support in the state house. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> again.|$|E

As in {{the final version of}} the episode, a narration scene with Rick speaking to Morgan on the walkie-talkie was included, but was re-shot with modified dialog that served to replace the above material, allowing the premiere to begin with the group putting Atlanta behind them. Rick sports his full sheriff's wardrobe in the reshoot, whereas in the original version he is wearing the white undershirt he was wearing in the Season 1 finale.|$|E

25|$|Prey {{is often}} flushed out of tall grass by the birds stomping on the {{surrounding}} vegetation. It also waits near fires, eating anything it can {{that is trying}} to escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Larger or dangerous prey, such as venomous snakes, are instead stunned or killed by the bird jumping onto their backs, at which point <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to snap their necks or backs. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, the secretary birds will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will tear apart prey with their feet before consuming it.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

500|$|Bowers {{notes that}} St. Elmo was filmed in a mansion built in 1759, {{but the name}} and {{location}} of the structure is unknown. The actual date of the filming is unknown. During {{the weeks leading up}} to the release, a spy for Thomas Edison's production company recorded details surrounding Thanhouser's production, including the filming of Thanhouser's first release, The Actor's Children. The spy, W. E. Lowenkamp, had a New York State Detective license. Lowenkamp's reports suggest the possibility of filming in a house on March 10, 1910 and the intention to film the following morning, but it is unknown if this was related to St. Elmos filming. Lowenkamp would speak to Edwin Thanhouser's sister in law, Carey L. Hastings, who took him as a real estate salesman was in film. Bower's reprints the report, [...] "The sister-in-law said the house they were using to take pictures would just suit Mr. Thanhouser, so I called a real estate office and gave them the tip so <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> and sell the house to Mr. Thanhouser and cover me."

2500|$|Confucius' {{political}} beliefs were rooted in {{his belief that}} a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion.

If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good."

The brothers leave and meet their father, who explains to Rusty James that, contrary to popular belief, neither his mother nor brother are crazy, but rather they were both born with an acute perception. The brothers go for a motorcycle ride through the city and arrive at the Pet Store where the Motorcycle Boy breaks in and starts to set the animals loose. Rusty James makes a last-gasp effort to convince his brother to reunite with him, but the Motorcycle Boy refuses, explaining that the differences between them are too great for them to ever have the life Rusty James speaks of. The Motorcycle Boy takes the fish and rushes to free them in the river, but is shot by Officer Patterson before he can. Rusty James, after hearing the gunshot, finishes his brother's last attempt while a large crowd of people converges on his body.|$|E
