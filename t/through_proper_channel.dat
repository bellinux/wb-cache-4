40|$|Abstract Providing each node {{with one}} or more {{multi-channel}} radios offers a promising avenue for enhancing the network capacity by simultaneously exploiting multiple non-overlapping channels through different radio interfaces and mitigating interferences <b>through</b> <b>proper</b> <b>channel</b> assignment. However, it is quite challenging to effectively utilize multiple channels and/or multiple radios to maximize throughput capacity. The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project 61128005 conducted comprehensive algorithmic-theoretic and queuing-theoretic studies of maximizing wireless networking capacity in multi-channel multi-radio (MC-MR) wireless networks under the protocol interference model and fundamentally advanced the state of the art. In addition, under the notoriously hard physical interference model, this project has taken initial algorithmic studies on maximizing the network capacity, with or without power control. We expect the new techniques and tools developed in this project will have wide applications in capacity planning, resource allocation and sharing, and protocol design for wireless networks, and will {{serve as the basis for}} future algorithm developments in wireless networks with advanced features, such as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless networks...|$|E

If the fluid is already dried at the crime scene then gauze piece/stain as such is first wetted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and then lifted with the help of forceps. The blood stains or non-blood biological stains are on victim/suspect cloths, or on small objects, then whole cloth/object as such is packed in a paper packet and finally in a cardboard box. If it’s a civil case such as paternity dispute, then blood samples on gauze piece or buccal swabs on the cotton of toothpicks are collected. All the wet exhibits, are first dried preferably in shade, wrapped in brown paper which are then finally sealed and labelled in a paper envelope where collector (usually a forensic expert) puts his/her signature with date and time of collection. The bone piece (flesh removed), teeth or hairs are also wrapped in brown papers in dry condition and then sealed in a paper envelope/carton boxes. If the exhibit is flesh, then instantaneously it is put in sterile metallic container, packed with ice/dry ice or in liquid nitrogen if available, which is then immediately shipped to the forensic laboratory <b>through</b> <b>proper</b> <b>channel.</b> The sealed and signed samples collected from the forensic experts are handed to the Investigating Officer (I/O) of the case (generally a police officer in rank of sub-inspector (SI) or above) who from first to last through the proper chain of custody, forwards the exhibits to the State Forensic Laboratory through the Judge of Civil or Criminal Court as the case may be, bearing his/her majesty’s seal and signature in the court’s forwarding letter as well in the exhibit packet(s).|$|E

40|$|Pakistan {{like other}} {{developing}} {{countries in the world}} is known for its high migration and workers’ remittance. Ingeneral it is considered that workers’ remittances are the important source for external finance and economicgrowth but many studies conducted on the same topic revealed some positive, negative and neutral responses ofworkers’ remittances toward economic growth. It is also argued that the high migration rate in any countryrepresents the poor economic conditions of that country. This study identifies the impact of workers’ remittanceson economic growth of Pakistan by analyzing time series data of twenty two years from 1991 to 2012. Regression model has been used to identify the relationship between the variables. The results conclude thatthere exist a significant positive relationship between workers’ remittances and economic growth in Pakistanand it has been recommended for policy implication that Pakistan should encourage and motivate the flow ofworkers’ remittances and adopt such policies that insist remitter to send money <b>through</b> <b>proper</b> <b>channels</b> so thatthese flows can be utilized in a better way for economic growth and development. </p...|$|R

No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the Ninety-five Theses have survived, {{but this is not}} surprising as Luther was not famous and the importance of the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of the Theses, only mentioned the door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the Theses on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections <b>through</b> <b>proper</b> <b>channels</b> rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the Theses to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on the door at all.
