25|$|In the Eucharist or Holy Communion service, the Book of Common Prayer {{specifies}} that {{bread and}} wine are consecrated for consumption by the people. A valid communion is made in either species, so those wishing for whatever reason to avoid alcohol can decline the cup and still make a valid communion.

If the underwear soaks up this moisture it will feel cold and clammy, particularly if this layer is against the skin. Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not soak up the condensate will be more comfortable. Early thermal undersuits for drysuits were commonly made from wool, as it retains its insulating properties better when wet than most other natural fibres.|$|E

25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability to see the world through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Egyptians, {{like many}} cultures, {{believed}} in an afterlife {{and much of}} what remains of their civilization reflects this because only the temples, tombs and other religious structures survive well. One belief {{that was at the}} center of Egyptian beliefs about life after death was the belief in the ka. The ka was believed by the Egyptians to be ones' life source, essence, and soul. Egyptians believed that after they died, their ka would continue to live as they had lived on earth in the afterlife. It would enjoy the same activities the individual had enjoyed on earth. Egyptians also believed that the ka had to have a body to return to, and because of this belief they would mummify their dead. Egyptians also took precautionary measures, in case their body did not survive, by commissioning ka statues; statues of the deceased that were buried in the tomb, along with the body, and would serve as a replacement if the body decayed beyond recognition. It was especially important to ensure <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's ka in the afterlife, due to his prominent position both in politics, and religion.|$|E

It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms, and featured numerous Turkish and Russian baths for the gentlemen of the day to relax in. Many of the floors were arranged as separate hotels to further <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests. Each of these floors had its own team of assistants—clerks, maids, page boys, waiters—as well as telephone and dumbwaiter service, and refrigerators. The bedrooms and corridors were heated by direct radiation.

500|$|The saddle {{with a solid}} tree {{provided}} a bearing surface to protect the horse from {{the weight of the}} rider. The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid-treed saddle, possibly as early as the 1st century BC, and it was widespread by the 2nd century AD. [...] Early medieval saddles resembled the Roman [...] "four-horn" [...] saddle, and were used without stirrups. The development of the solid saddle tree was significant; it raised the rider above the horse's back, and distributed the rider's weight, reducing the pounds per square inch carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus [...] greatly increasing <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse and prolonging its useful life. Horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree. [...] It also allowed a more built up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle. [...] From the 12th century on, the high war-saddle became more common, providing protection as well as added security. The built up cantle of a solid-treed saddle enabled horsemen to use lance more effectively.|$|E
500|$|Author Kovid Gupta {{classified}} Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! as a {{film that}} bridges the gap between traditionalism and modernity.

Patricia Uberoi called the film a family film in two ways; it is about family relationships, and it is suitable for the entire family to watch. She said that the film {{is not about the}} two leads, but about the family, an ideal family. Tejaswini Ganti has called the film a [...] "paean to filial duty" [...] for how the children are willing to sacrifice their love for the good of their families. The family relationships are also noted for being different from the normal cinematic families of the time due to their mutual civility. Rediff.com noted that [...] "Though the film was initially dismissed as a wedding video, its success indicated that post-liberalisation, Indian audiences still clung to <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> familiar." [...] Jigna Desai said that the film's popularity was due to interactions of the families around the traditional folk wedding practices. In his study on the response to the film, academic Vamsee Juluri concluded that the celebration of the family is HAHKs [...] "most useful contribution to history".|$|E
