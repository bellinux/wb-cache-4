5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>among</b> these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film.

In 1948, he used a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked.

25|$|Bifrenaria has {{traditionally}} been classified in subtribe Bifrenariinae of tribe Maxillarieae (Epidendroideae), however, the relationships among the several genera within this tribe are not well defined and changes are expected in the upcoming years.

The unification of subtribes Lycastinae, Maxillariinae and Bifrenariinae has recently been suggested. However, there is no consensus on the path to be followed. Contrary to what was previously thought, <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>among</b> Bifrenaria and all these genera from Central America seems to indicate a primitive origin of Bifrenaria in Central America and its posterior dissemination towards the Southeast of Brazil, where it found fertile grounds to its more recent evolution.|$|E
500|$|In The Lion King 1½, a direct-to-video followup {{released}} in 2004, Simba {{appears as a}} less prominent character because the film's primary focus is on Timon and Pumbaa's behind-the-scenes role and involvement in The Lion King, in which they appear as supporting characters.

2500|$|As {{a highly}} {{interdisciplinary}} field in systems science, landscape ecology integrates biophysical and analytical approaches with humanistic and holistic perspectives across {{the natural sciences}} and social sciences. [...] Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by diverse interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands, and lakes to human-dominated environments including agricultural and urban settings. [...] The most salient characteristics of landscape ecology are its emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>among</b> pattern, process and scale, and its focus on broad-scale ecological and environmental issues. These necessitate the coupling between biophysical and socioeconomic sciences. [...] Key research topics in landscape ecology include ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, and landscape conservation and sustainability.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, the British {{physicist}} Ralph H. Fowler {{observed that}} the relationship between the density, energy, and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei that obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. [...] This Fermi gas model was then used by the British physicist Edmund Clifton Stoner in 1929 to calculate <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>among</b> the mass, radius, and density of white dwarfs, assuming they were homogeneous spheres. Wilhelm Anderson applied a relativistic correction to this model, giving rise to a maximum possible mass of approximately 1.37 kg. In 1930, Stoner derived the internal energydensity equation of state for a Fermi gas, and was then able to treat the mass–radius relationship in a fully relativistic manner, giving a limiting mass of approximately (for μe=2.5) 2.19 · 1030 kg. [...] Stoner went on to derive the pressuredensity equation of state, which he published in 1932.
