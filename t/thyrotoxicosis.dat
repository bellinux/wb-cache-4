5|$|In medicine, a {{saturated}} solution of potassium iodide {{is used to}} treat acute <b>thyrotoxicosis.</b> It {{is also used to}} block uptake of iodine-131 in the thyroid gland (see isotopes section above), when this isotope is used as part of radiopharmaceuticals (such as iobenguane) that are not targeted to the thyroid or thyroid-type tissues.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} periodic paralysis (especially hypokalemic periodic paralysis) with thyroid function tests on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is true}} that in most {{patients}} ophthalmopathy, goiter, and symptoms of <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> appear more or less coincidentally, {{it is also true that}} in certain cases eye signs may appear long before <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> is evident, or become worse when the <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> is subsiding or has been controlled by treatment. In approximately 20% of ophthalmopathy patients, ophthalmopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism, in about 40% concurrently, and in about 20% in the six months after diagnosis. In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> (including Graves' disease) with 600–2,000mg {{potassium}} perchlorate (430–1,400mg perchlorate) daily for periods of several months or longer was once common practice, particularly in Europe, and perchlorate use at lower doses to treat thryoid problems {{continues to this}} day. Although 400mg of {{potassium perchlorate}} divided into four or five daily doses was used initially and found effective, higher doses were introduced when 400mg/day was discovered not to control <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> in all subjects.|$|E
25|$|L-Thyroxine over-replacement may {{contribute}} to osteoporosis, {{in a similar fashion}} as <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> does. This can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes may be {{activated}} or intensified, and its control worsened. The diabetes is ameliorated or may disappear when the <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> is treated.|$|E
25|$|Current regimens for {{treatment}} of <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> (including Graves' disease), when a patient is exposed to additional sources of iodine, commonly include 500mg potassium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40 days.|$|E
25|$|Hyperthyroidism is the {{condition}} that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. <b>Thyrotoxicosis</b> is {{the condition}} that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|Another {{effect of}} {{hyperthyroidism}} is bone loss from osteoporosis, {{caused by an}} increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine and stool. The effects can be minimized if the hyperthyroidism is treated early. <b>Thyrotoxicosis</b> can also augment calcium levels in the blood {{by as much as}} 25%. This can cause stomach upset, excessive urination, and impaired kidney function.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} the {{reduction}} in bone density in most studies is 10–20%. The clinical manifestations on bone differ depending on {{the age of the}} patient. Postmenopausal woman are most sensitive to accelerated bone loss from <b>thyrotoxicosis.</b> Accelerated bone growth in growing children can increase ossification in the short term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights.|$|E
25|$|Major uses of 131I {{include the}} {{treatment}} of <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> (hyperthyroidism) and some types of thyroid cancer that absorb iodine. The 131I is thus used as direct radioisotope therapy to treat hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, and sometimes hyperactive thyroid nodules (abnormally active thyroid tissue that is not malignant). The therapeutic use of radioiodine to treat hyperthyroidism from Graves' disease was first reported by Saul Hertz in 1941.|$|E
25|$|However, if the <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> {{is treated}} early, bone loss can be minimized. The level of calcium {{in the blood}} can be {{determined}} by a simple blood test, and a bone density scan can document the amount of bone loss. There are many medications that can help to rebuild bone mass and to prevent further bone loss. Risedronate treatment has been demonstrated to help restore bone mass in osteopenia/osteoporosis associated with Graves' disease. Nevertheless, weight-bearing exercises, a balanced diet, calcium intake of about 1500mg a day and enough vitamin D, are of course elementary foundations.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be {{confused}} with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and pancreatic disease, immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, antiphospholipid syndrome and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. It must be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when preexisting disease such as hypertension is present. Women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy may also present with elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine, but differ by the extent of liver damage. Other disorders that can cause high blood pressure include <b>thyrotoxicosis,</b> pheochromocytoma, and drug misuse.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{radioisotope}} therapy (RIT) {{is a form}} {{of targeted}} therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through infusion (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) to treat neuroblastoma, of oral iodine-131 to treat thyroid cancer or <b>thyrotoxicosis,</b> and of hormone-bound lutetium-177 and yttrium-90 to treat neuroendocrine tumors (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy).|$|E
25|$|High blood {{pressure}} and valvular heart disease {{are the most common}} alterable risk factors for AF. Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. In the developing world valvular heart disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other factors include excess alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and <b>thyrotoxicosis.</b> However, half of cases are not associated with any of these risks. A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG). A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate.|$|E
25|$|Overt, {{symptomatic}} thyroid dysfunction is {{the most}} common complication, with about 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis progressing to thyroid failure every year. Transient periods of <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> (over-activity of the thyroid) sometimes occur, and rarely the illness may progress to full hyperthyroid Graves' disease with active orbitopathy (bulging, inflamed eyes). Rare cases of fibrous autoimmune thyroiditis present with severe dyspnea (shortness of breath) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), resembling aggressive thyroid tumors – but such symptoms always improve with surgery or corticosteroid therapy. Primary thyroid B cell lymphoma affects fewer than one in a thousand persons, and it is more likely to affect those with long-standing autoimmune thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|Propranolol, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Inderal among others, is a {{medication}} of the beta blocker type. It is used to treat high blood pressure, a number of types of irregular heart rate, <b>thyrotoxicosis,</b> capillary hemangiomas, performance anxiety, and essential tremors. It is used to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. The formulation that is taken by mouth comes in short acting and long acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the mental symptoms of subclinical thyroid disease, might be found {{in the fact that the}} brain has among the highest expression of THR's, and that neurons are often more sensitive than other tissues to thyroid abnormalities, including sublicnical hyperthyroidism and <b>thyrotoxicosis.</b> In a 1996 survey study respondents reported a significant decline in memory, attention, planning, and overall productivity from the period 2 years prior to Graves' symptoms onset to the period when hyperthyroid. Also, hypersensitivity of the central nervous system to low-grade hyperthyroidism can result in an anxiety disorder before other Graves' disease symptoms emerge. E.g., panic disorder has been reported to precede Graves' hyperthyroidism by 4 to 5 years in some cases, although it is not known how frequently this occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Other rare {{causes of}} {{hyperthermia}} include <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> and an adrenal gland tumor, called pheochromocytoma, {{both of which}} can cause increased heat production. [...] Damage to the central nervous system, from brain hemorrhage, status epilepticus, {{and other kinds of}} injury to the hypothalamus can also cause hyperthermia.|$|E
2500|$|Pioneering work by Noel Rose and Ernst Witebsky in New York, and Roitt and Doniach at University College London {{provided}} {{clear evidence}} that, {{at least in}} terms of antibody-producing B cells (B lymphocytes), diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> are associated with loss of immunological tolerance, which is the ability of an individual to ignore [...] "self", while reacting to [...] "non-self". [...] This breakage leads to the immune system's mounting an effective and specific immune response against self determinants. The exact genesis of immunological tolerance is still elusive, but several theories have been proposed since the mid-twentieth century to explain its origin.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{relatively}} non-specific symptoms of initial hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is often misdiagnosed as depression, cyclothymia, PMS, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and, less frequently, as erectile dysfunction [...] or [...] an anxiety disorder. On gross examination, {{there is often}} presentation of a hard goiter that is not painful to the touch; other symptoms seen with hypothyroidism, such as periorbital myxedema, depend on {{the current state of}} progression of the response, especially given the usually gradual development of clinically relevant hypothyroidism. Testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, free T4, and the anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO, or TPOAb) and anti-microsomal antibodies can help obtain an accurate diagnosis. Earlier assessment of the person may present with elevated levels of thyroglobulin owing to transient <b>thyrotoxicosis,</b> as inflammation within the thyroid causes damage to the integrity of thyroid follicle storage of thyroglobulin; TSH is increased as the pituitary tries to increase production of T4 by the thyroid gland.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders and mental disorder symptoms in Graves' disease (and thyroid disease in general), which {{are similar to those}} in patients with organic brain disease. These manifestations are diverse, affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. The vast majority of patients with hyperthyroidism meet criteria for some psychiatric disorders, and those with milder presentations are probably not entirely free of mental symptoms such as emotional lability, tension, depression and anxiety. Anxiety syndromes related to hyperthyroidism are typically complicated by major depression and cognitive decline, such as in memory and attention. Some studies contradict the psychological findings. For example, a large 2002 study found [...] "no statistical association between thyroid dysfunction, and the presence of depression or anxiety disorder." [...] In one study on hospitalised elderly patients, over half had cognitive impairment with either dementia or confusion. However, a controlled study on 31 Graves' disease patients found that while patients had subjective reports of cognitive deficits in the toxic phase of Graves' <b>thyrotoxicosis,</b> formal testing found no cognitive impairment and suggested the reported symptoms may reflect the affective and somatic manifestations of hyperthyroidism. Notably, a literature review of 2006 notes methodology issues in the consistency of Graves' disease diagnostic criteria, which might explain the apparently contradicting findings. These researchers found many reports about residual complaints in patients who were euthyroid after treatment, with a high prevalence of anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder, as well as elevated scores on scales of anxiety, depression and psychological distress. In a 1992 study, a significant proportion of the 137 questioned patients with Graves' disease reported – among other things – increased crying (55%), being easily startled (53%), being tired all the time (47%), a significant decrease in social activity (46%), feelings of being out of control (45%), feelings of hopelesness (43%), loss of sense of humor (41%), loss of interest in things they formerly enjoyed (39%), not being able to 'connect' with others (34%).|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyrotoxicosis</b> {{can also}} occur after taking too much thyroid hormone {{in the form}} of supplements, such as {{levothyroxine}} (a phenomenon known as exogenous <b>thyrotoxicosis,</b> alimentary <b>thyrotoxicosis,</b> or occult factitial <b>thyrotoxicosis).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyrotoxicosis</b> factitia {{refers to}} a {{condition}} of <b>thyrotoxicosis</b> caused by the ingestion of exogenous thyroid hormone. It can be the result of mistaken ingestion of excess drug, such as levothyroxine, or as a symptom of Munchausen syndrome. It is an uncommon form of hyperthyroidism.|$|E
