He first flew his own flag in late July 1723. Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the mizzen peak <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.|$|E

5|$|Modell named Brown's chief assistant, Blanton Collier, as the team's {{new head}} coach. Collier was a friendly, studious man {{who became a}} player {{favorite}} as an assistant on both offense and defense under Brown. He installed an open offense and allowed Ryan <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> own plays. In Collier's first season, the Browns finished with a 10–4 record but fell short of a division title. Jim Brown won the MVP award in 1963 with a record 1,863yards rushing. Dominant blocking from the Browns' offensive line, which included guard Gene Hickerson and left tackle Dick Schafrath, helped boost his totals.|$|E

5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout.

Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock {{was too much to}} bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} by Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) on television {{that he plans to}} travel to outer space, and is willing to pay up to thirty million dollars to do so. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to help Tracy with his dream of traveling in space, promising <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> friends at NASA. Instead of doing this, however, he asks The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to create a fake space experience for Tracy. Pete and the TGS crew construct a model space shuttle and place Tracy in it after disorienting him by flying him in a helicopter blindfolded. The deception is a success, and Tracy believes that he is, in fact, flying in space.|$|E
5|$|Washington v.

Jackie Washington had attempted <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> co-defendant as a witness, but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co-defendants from testifying for each other, under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand.|$|E

5|$|Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) waits nervously for {{an answer}} from his girlfriend, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), about going into witness {{protection}} with him. He states {{that it is too}} dangerous for him to stay in Erinsborough and that she can bring her younger sister, Sophie (Kaiya Jones), with them. Kate tells Mark that she does not want to lose him and agrees to go. Mark reveals that they only have half an hour and heads over to his house to pack. Sophie returns home and Kate tells her that they are leaving town that night. An upset Sophie explains that she cannot pack her life up in a bag and refuses to go. Kate tells her the decision has already been made and they are leaving. As Mark is wondering whether <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> parents, his housemate, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), arrives home unexpectedly. When she enquires about his bag, he tells her he needs a change of clothes for a double shift. Kate finds Mark and asks for more time, but Mark tells her they do not have any. He gives her the details of the meeting point and they kiss, before Kate leaves him.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers scored {{their first}} points, {{but were not}} able to score enough to win, despite {{statistically}} outperforming the Buffalo Bills in most phases of the game. The Buccaneers had only three Dave Green field goals to show for seven possessions inside the Bills’ 22-yard line. O.J. Simpson, who would rush for a season total of 1,503 yards, was held to only 39 yards on twenty carries. The Bills, the highest-scoring team in recent years, were 1 of 12 in third-down conversions, and were surpassed in yardage, first downs, rushing average, and number of total plays. Buffalo took the lead on Bob Chandler’s 58-yard reception of a tipped pass. The Buccaneers’ 338 yards of offense, a great improvement over their previous two games, coincided with coach McKay’s relenting to Steve Spurrier’s demands that he be able <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> own plays. Spurrier suffered a bone chip in his throwing hand that made his status questionable for the next week’s game.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{used those}} days {{to design the}} {{structure}} of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the phone as well as expand the game's world.|$|E

5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>his</b> answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
