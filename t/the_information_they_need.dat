500|$|Although he {{initially}} helps the Winchesters in Season 7 {{in their struggle}} against the Leviathans—God's original creations, trapped for millennia in Purgatory until they were unintentionally released by Castiel—despite the destruction of his house, even determining their new foes' vulnerability to the chemical Borax, Bobby is eventually {{shot in the head}} by Dick Roman in [...] "How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters". He spends the next episode, [...] "Death's Door", in a coma, trying to reawaken to reveal the Leviathan's plot. Despite efforts to save him, Bobby flatlines from his injuries; his last word being [...] "idjits" [...] (sic, idiots) to Sam and Dean after passing on a sequence of numbers. The episode ends with a reaper asking Bobby if he is going to become a ghost or move on to the afterlife. It's indicated that he stayed as a ghost to help the boys as there have been times since his death when <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> inexplicably makes itself known to them, but they were initially unable to confirm or deny Bobby's possible presence. During [...] "Party On, Garth," [...] Sam reveals that he tried to use a talking board to contact him if he is still around, but received no response. However, Garth registers high readings on an EMF detector around Bobby's old flask, and when Dean needed a sword to slay a shojo, it inexplicably slid across the ground to him, leading him to believe that Bobby had helped him. At the end of the episode, Bobby's spirit {{can be seen in the}} brother's motel room, and he is annoyed when Dean comes in, looks right at him, and does not see him, instead grabbing his flask.|$|E
2500|$|Signaling and {{operation}} on the Washington Metro system involves train control, station identification, train signaling, signage, and train length. [...] As with any working railroad, communication between train operators, dispatchers, station personnel and passengers is critical. [...] Failures {{will result in}} delays, accidents, and even fatalities. [...] It is therefore important that a comprehensive signal system operated by a central authority be in place.

2500|$|William F. Schulz, Executive Director of the U.S. {{section of}} Amnesty International, found Dershowitz's ticking-bomb {{scenario}} unrealistic because, he argued, {{it would require}} that [...] "the authorities know that a bomb has been planted somewhere; know it {{is about to go}} off; know that the suspect in their custody has <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to stop it; know that the suspect will yield that information accurately {{in a matter of minutes}} if subjected to torture; and know that there is no other way to obtain it."

50|$|In 1972, Hildebrand {{set up the}} Amazon {{branch of}} the Colombian Anthropological Institute, in La Pedrera, through which {{he was able to}} bring {{together}} a multi-disciplinary team of specialists (biologists, lawyers, anthropologists, doctors and educationists).

25|$|For many lesbians {{who responded}} to Whitt’s survey, the library was the most {{important}} source for locating <b>information</b> during <b>the</b> initial stages of coming out, especially in remote areas without a visible community.

50|$|Some {{libraries}} describe book vandalism as genuine {{information seeking}} behavior. Stanford University's Medical library blamed book vandalism on student's need for <b>information.</b> <b>The</b> {{director of the}} library, Peter Stangl, said that the most students often wanted the same books, so were stealing <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> for classes. In the Memphis study, {{one of the most}} relevant reasons for library vandalism was that the books mutilated could not be checked out of the library.

Remarkably, although the Citizens' Assembly had produced a shorter version of their report and a short leaflet further summarizing it, Elections Ontario distributed neither, to the surprise and disappointment of the Citizens' Assembly. By contrast in British Columbia, the Citizens' Assembly material was distributed to every household.|$|R
2500|$|He {{argued that}} {{by making the}} meaning as readily {{accessible}} as possible, the writer would achieve the greatest possible communicative efficiency.

While the overall influence that [...] "The Philosophy of Style" [...] had on the field of rhetoric was not as far-reaching as his contribution to other fields, Spencer's voice lent authoritative support to formalist views of rhetoric.|$|R
