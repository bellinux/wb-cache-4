5|$|After {{hostilities}} {{broke out}} on the frontier between the Americans and the native tribes, culminating in the Battle of Tippecanoe in November 1811, Jennings successfully promoted passage of a bill to grant compensation to veterans of the battle and to give pensions for five years to the widows and orphans {{of those who were}} killed. Privately, Jennings lamented the battle, while his friends in the territory faulted Harrison for agitating the situation and causing the needless loss of life. As calls for war with Great Britain increased, Jennings was not among the war hawks, but ultimately accepted the arrival of the War of 1812. Early in the war, Harrison was commissioned as a military general and dispatched to defend the frontier and invade Canada, which caused him to resign from his post as <b>territorial</b> governor in 1812. Prior to Harrison's resignation, Jennings and his allies moved quickly {{to take advantage of the}} situation and initiated efforts to weaken the governor's authority. In 1811 the <b>territorial</b> legislature voted to move the capital away from Vincennes, a pro-Harrison stronghold, and began a shift in political power from the <b>territorial</b> governor to the delegates in the <b>territorial</b> legislature and its elected officials. John Gibson, the elderly, acting governor, whose <b>territorial</b> duties largely dealt with military affairs, did not challenge the <b>territorial</b> legislature. When Harrison's successor, Thomas Posey, was confirmed on March 3, 1813, Jennings's party in the <b>territorial</b> legislature had become entrenched and began to advance their request for statehood.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{began his}} {{political}} career when he resigned from the military effective June 1, 1798. and campaigned among {{his friends and family}} for a post in the Northwest <b>Territorial</b> government. With the aid of his close friend Timothy Pickering, who was serving as U.S. Secretary of State, Harrison received a recommendation to replace Withrop Sargent, the outgoing <b>territorial</b> secretary. President John Adams appointed Harrison to the position in July 1798. Harrison frequently served as acting <b>territorial</b> governor during the absences of Governor Arthur St. Clair.|$|E

Three represented Washington Territory as delegates to the U.S. House, and one additionally represented Idaho Territory in the same fashion, as well as serving as Governor of Idaho Territory. Two <b>territorial</b> governors represented eastern states, one as a representative from, and governor of, New Jersey, and one represented Virginia both in the United States and Confederate Houses. Three governors represented {{the state in the}} U.S. Senate, and two represented the state in the House. One governor has served in the United States Cabinet.

5|$|The <b>Territorial</b> Army and Militia Act 1921 {{changed the}} <b>Territorial</b> Force into the <b>Territorial</b> Army, and the Special Reserve {{returned}} to its old title of Militia. The Air Force (Constitution) Act 1917 had created a reserve and an auxiliary force for the newly constituted Royal Air Force, and the Auxiliary Air Force and Air Force Reserve Act 1924 modified the 1907 Act so as to allow County Associations to administer the <b>Territorial</b> Army and the Auxiliary Air Force. The Auxiliary and Reserve Forces Act 1949 gave the County Associations responsibility for the Army Cadet Force.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Territorial</b> Force {{formally}} {{came into}} existence on 1 April 1908, at which date the existing Volunteer force ceased to exist. Under an Order in Council of 19 March, all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers had been transferred to the <b>Territorial</b> Force, with {{a small number of}} exceptions. The transferred units were reorganised and amalgamated to produce a force of the anticipated size; {{with the exception of a}} small number of Royal Horse Artillery batteries, every new <b>Territorial</b> Force unit could trace its lineage to a Volunteer or Yeomanry unit.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Territorial</b> Force now {{constituted}} 204 infantry battalions (ten {{of which}} were organised as bicycle infantry) and 56 Yeomanry regiments, organised into fourteen divisions and fourteen cavalry brigades, along with associated support troops. A new all-Territorial regiment, the London Regiment, was formed to encompass twenty-seven battalions which had previously been associated with various regular regiments. The divisional troops were raised and administered by the County Associations, whilst the divisions themselves were operationally commanded by regular staff officers. Outside of the divisional structure, a <b>Territorial</b> Medical Corps was created, followed by a <b>Territorial</b> Association Nursing Service.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} legislation, the <b>territorials</b> {{were only}} liable to serve within the United Kingdom. Haldane envisioned that the <b>territorials</b> would take over {{the defense of the}} country against what was {{perceived}} as a very real threat of invasion, which would allow the regular army to be deployed aboard. In addition, Haldane saw the <b>territorials</b> as a source of reinforcements for the regular army. Six months following mobilization, during which time the troops would have come up to an acceptable training standard, Haldane was confident that up to a quarter of the men would opt to go and fight abroad.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Territorial</b> Force was disbanded {{and later}} {{reformed}} as the <b>Territorial</b> Army and the regiment's battalions were also reformed. However, inter-war reductions and reorganisations reduced the regiment's <b>territorial</b> battalions {{from six to}} just one by 1937. The 8th disbanded in the early 1920s, the 9th was absorbed by the Royal Engineers, and a restructuring of the <b>Territorial</b> Army's infantry in the mid-1930s converted the 6th, 7th, and 10th to new roles. The 6th were transferred to the Royal Engineers and became 38th (King's) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Engineers. The 7th joined the Royal Tank Regiment and became the 40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment, and the 10th became a battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante {{justice and the}} Montana Vigilantes began in 1863 in what {{was at the time}} a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana <b>Territorial</b> period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because <b>territorial</b> law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the <b>territorial</b> period.|$|E

5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in <b>territorial</b> disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in <b>territorial</b> disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with <b>territorial</b> encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E
