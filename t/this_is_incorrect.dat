5|$|The 1910 {{edition of}} St. Elmo by Hurst & Company is {{sometimes}} marked {{as having been}} drawn from a movie. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect,</b> {{it was designed to}} appeal to theater patrons and copyrighted in January 1910. Another 1910 publication by M.A Donahue includes photographs marked as having been produced by Lawrence Co. of Chicago. It does not indicate that it is from the Thanhouser production.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle has}} been widely {{described}} as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200–1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from erroneous Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported {{during and after the}} battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that furthered this erroneous narrative. Some of these Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks and assault guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} emblem of Belarus, which replaced the historic Pahonia {{arms in a}} 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of Belarus, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria.|$|E

5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the {{foundation}} of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet. As they represented {{a shift in the}} strategic outlook of the German navy, the traditional method of ship construction, which relied heavily on foreign models, was abandoned. Some experimentation was implemented in the design process, particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships. Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials, while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel-steel alloy armor plating. The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation. While a novel concept, the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired, which led to the idea being abandoned. This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto-dreadnoughts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect,</b> as the guns were not of the same length, and the ships were designed to fight at close range, unlike the later dreadnought battleships.|$|E

25|$|On August 8, 1964, {{a pair of}} {{commercial}} pilots flew a Cessna 150 into the Meteor Crater in Arizona. On crossing the rim, they could not maintain level flight. The pilot attempted to build up speed by circling in the crater to climb over the rim. During the attempted climbout, the aircraft stalled, crashed, and caught fire. It is commonly reported that the plane ran out of fuel, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect.</b> Both occupants were severely injured but survived their ordeal.

25|$|The dragons in {{the story}} are scaled, fire-spewing, reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence. Though some {{accompanying}} artwork for A Song of Ice and Fire portrays them with four legs and a detached set of wings, George R.R. Martin insists that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect.</b> His dragons are serpentine and slender, and they have four (not six) extremities (consider the wyvern), of which two are the front wings. Martin first considered having the Targaryens use a pyrotechnic effect to feign dragon powers, but decided on living dragons instead, though he refused to give them human speech. Comparing the dragons to modern-day nuclear arsenals, Martin questions whether supreme power enables the user to reform, improve, or build society.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 {{has also}} been {{exported}} widely. Foreign nations which field, or have fielded, the Type 62 include North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of the Congo, Mali, Albania and Sudan. There {{is a lot of}} confusion concerning the North Korean Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank which is sometimes considered to be an upgrade of Type 62 light tank. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> as the Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank is based on the Soviet T-62 main battle tank. This originated from the fact that many times tanks like Type 59 and Type 62 are listed as T-59 and T-62. This leads to many confusions which in turn lead to, for example, listing the Albania as T-62 main battle tank operator and calling the Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank an upgrade of Type 62 light tank. It's not clear which nations still have them in service, although based on available knowledge it seems that all original users still have it either on active or reserve status except for North Korea which didn't have them in service as of 1995.|$|E

50|$|The final {{mistake was}} {{inappropriate}} {{manipulation of the}} flaps, from 30 degrees to 15 degrees, while the plane's airspeed was still too low, with spoilers extended. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>incorrect</b> while attempting to go-around with the stick shaker activating because the decreased lift resulted in increased stall speed.|$|R

It is believed by some that WWE's Vince McMahon had to approve The Ultimate Fighter following RAW, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect.</b> According to Hecht, McMahon {{did not have the}} final say, but given his stature and RAW's importance to Spike TV at the time, the network wanted McMahon to [...] "be on board" [...] with the program lineup.

500|$|Similar to {{the long}} jump, the triple jump takes place on a track heading towards a sandpit. Originally, athletes would hop on the same leg twice before jumping into the pit, but this was changed to the current [...] "hop, step and jump" [...] pattern from 1900 onwards. There is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient Greece: while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps {{occurred}} at Ancient Games, others such as Stephen G. Miller believe <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect,</b> suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of Phayllus of Croton having jumped 55 ancient feet (around 16.3m). The Book of Leinster, a 12th-century Irish manuscript, records the existence of geal-ruith (triple jump) contests at the Tailteann Games.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle of}} San Lorenzo was also {{mentioned}} as an Argentine {{victory in the}} first Argentine National Anthem, along with the battles of San José, Suipacha, Las Piedras, Salta and Tucumán. There is also a brief reference to the battle in the march Mi bandera ("My flag"), {{which is about the}} flag of Argentina. However, this march includes a historic inaccuracy. It says [...] "Here is the flag that one day triumphantly rose {{in the middle of the}} battle and, full of pride and gallantry, went immortally to San Lorenzo". <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> as the current flag of Argentina was not widely used until 1814 or 1815. The Battle of Salta was the only conflict of the Argentine War of Independence fought in current Argentine territory under the modern flag of Argentina. The San Martín National Institute states, by oral tradition, that the grenadiers of San Lorenzo did not use any flag for the operation.|$|E
500|$|Sicherman {{writes that}} [...] "A Valediction" [...] {{is an example}} of Donne's writing style, {{providing}} [...] " [...] confident opening, a middle in which initial certainties give way gradually to new perceptions, and a conclusion manifesting a clear and profoundly rooted assurance". At the same time, she considers it [...] "a poem whose development is so subtle, whose conclusion so perfect, that one may remain unaware of while responsive to the pattern of discovery". The analogy of beaten gold was heavily criticised by T. S. Eliot as not being based on a statement of philosophical theory; Targoff argues that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> — that Donne had a consistent philosophy, and that the analogy of beaten gold {{can be traced to the}} writings of Tertullian, one of Donne's greatest religious influences. Another critic of Donne, Samuel Johnson, noted that the poem's compass analogy highlights the [...] "violence" [...] used by metaphysical poets to [...] " [...] the most heterogeneous ideas together".|$|E
