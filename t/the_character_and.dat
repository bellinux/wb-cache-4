5|$|Constantin Amăriuţei {{was noted}} for {{defining}} Mitică's character (Miticism) through onthologic terms {{borrowed from the}} German philosopher Martin Heidegger.

5|$|After {{the mixed}} {{reception}} of Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired the film rights to <b>the</b> <b>character,</b> <b>and</b> writer Zak Penn {{began work on}} a sequel titled The Incredible Hulk. However, Edward Norton rewrote Penn's script after he signed on to star, retelling the origin story in flashbacks and revelations, to help in establishing the film as a reboot; director Louis Leterrier agreed with this approach. Leterrier acknowledged that the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America.|$|E

5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>and</b> {{the program}} were {{announced}} to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was not ready for use at that time.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Edgar Allan Poe's {{masterpiece}} short stories, "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "The Pit and the Pendulum. " In this study, I pay attention to how the psychological condition of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> settings in "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "The Pit and the Pendulum" influence each other as the major problem of the analysis. In this thesis, I want to reveal that the psychological condition of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> settings really influence each other. I use the theory of characterization and setting to analyze the psychological condition of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> setting. In the analyzing I know that mental condition of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> {{is influenced by the}} fearful circumstances and this makes their mental disorder worse; besides, the mental disorder can make the fearful circumstances more fearful. I can conclude that the psychological problems of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fearful setting really influence each other...|$|R
