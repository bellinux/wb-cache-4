5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on February7 south of Diego Garcia. For about a week, the system remained weak and changed directions several times; after an eastward movement, it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, curved to the southeast, and later began a steady track to the southwest. On February13, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and quickly attained peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). Given the name Haja, the storm passed southeast of Rodrigues and Réunion. Haja approached the southeast coast of Madagascar, but <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> {{the southeast and}} weakened, dissipating on February19.|$|E

By 12hours after landfall, there was little evidence of a circulation on satellite imagery. Late on June27, Carlos degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area near Acapulco. The circulation <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the southwest and emerged into the Pacific Ocean; by 0000UTC on June29, the system dissipated completely.|$|E

Ophelia <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and brushed past Nantucket Island, Massachusetts on the next day. As it approached Nova Scotia on September 17, the storm became extratropical, but maintained its strength as it made landfall in the extreme eastern portion of the province. The extratropical storm passed over southern Newfoundland later that day, before finally dissipating on September 23 in the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Charlie {{developed}} on August21 {{to the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later. For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On August25, it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August28. On August30, Charlie attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h), although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> a westward drift. On September2, Charlie <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the north and northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by September5 Charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 480mi (775km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on September5 without having affected land.|$|E
5|$|Late on August 29, Hurricane Edouard {{developed}} three concentric eyewalls, {{an unusual}} occurrence coinciding {{with an increase}} in strength to 140mph (220km/h). A mid-tropospheric trough turned the hurricane to the north to an area of unfavorable conditions, and Edouard weakened to a Category3 hurricanes on August 31. On September 1, the hurricane passed about midway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the north-northeast. Edouard continued to weaken as it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, and on September 2 passed about 95mi (150km) to the southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts as an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane, its closest point of approach to the United States. Edouard weakened to tropical storm status on September 3, and became extratropical shortly thereafter while located to the south of Nova Scotia. As an extratropical storm, Edouard <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the east, then moved around the periphery of a larger extratropical storm until becoming absorbed by the storm early on September 7.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{the name}} Able, the small {{hurricane}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> {{the southeast and}} to the east while passing near or over the Bahama Banks. Able subsequently <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and later to the north, and finished executing its cyclonic loop on May 20. The hurricane continued to intensify with an eye 20miles (32km) in diameter, and on May 21 Reconnaissance Aircraft estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h). Shortly thereafter Able passed about 70miles (110km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and early on May 22 Able weakened from its peak intensity after turning to the east. On May 23 it deteriorated into a tropical storm while passing over cooler waters, and that night Able became an extratropical cyclone while located about 520miles (840km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The extratropical remnant <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast before losing its identity late on May 24.|$|E

5|$|While {{moving to}} the south, Hyacinthe's winds {{steadily}} decreased. On January21, the storm weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, and on January22 the JTWC estimated winds decreased to 75km/h (45mph). The next day, it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the east while slowly re-intensifying. On January24, the JTWC upgraded Hyacinthe to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, with winds of 120km/h (75mph). After approaching within 175km (120mi) west-southwest of Réunion, the cyclone <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northwest and executed another loop. The JTWC estimated that Hyacinthe reached peak winds of 130km/h (80mph) on January25, which the storm maintained for about 24hours. During that time, Hyacinthe <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the southeast and later weakened. On January26, it moved near Réunion for the third time, passing about 105km (65mi) to the south. The storm turned southward, becoming extratropical on January29. Over the next two days, the remnants of Hyacinthe accelerated, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the east, and dissipated over the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} {{existed in the}} central Caribbean Sea in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 31. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By November 1, little convection remained as the weak depression <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the north and crossed Cuba. A burst of convection organized over the depression, and brought strong wind gusts to the Florida Keys as it passed through the area on November 2. It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida west coast, and lost all of its convection on November 3. The system <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, and merged with a weak extratropical low over northern Florida on November 4.|$|E
5|$|A strong ridge {{over the}} north Atlantic Ocean turned Emmy sharply eastward on August 29. The {{hurricane}} continued to strengthen, and Emmy attained a peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) shortly after turning to the east while located 500miles (800km) northeast of Bermuda. The hurricane maintained its peak intensity for 42hours while moving eastward at 17mph (27km/h), and slowly weakened after peaking in strength. On September 1, Emmy <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the east-southeast, and a day later it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast as its forward motion decreased. Emmy passed through the Azores on September 3, and the following day it became extratropical {{to the north of}} the islands.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was present in}} the east-central Atlantic on October17. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October24. Subsequently, the system <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the south and quickly dissipated. This {{tropical storm}} {{was not included in}} the Monthly Weather Reviews summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Depression Six {{while it was}} centered about 1,150miles (1,850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles on September3.

Erika passed a short distance {{to the north of}} the Lesser Antilles, and later <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the north in response to an approaching trough. The hurricane quickly strengthen to reach peak winds of 125mph (195km/h) on September8, and after maintaining peak strength for 24hours Erika weakened over cooler waters.
