5|$|Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous {{and best}} known {{member of the}} family Heterodontosauridae. This family is {{considered}} one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of ornithischian dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> herbivorous, or at least omnivorous. Though it was formerly <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> capable of quadrupedal locomotion, it is now <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Cathedral of St. James (Սուրբ Յակոբեանց վանք, Surb Hakobeants vank) is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{founded in}} the 4th century, but the current {{structure}} dates to the 12th century.|$|E

50|$|Clouthier {{died in a}} {{controversial}} car accident while in the Culiacán, Sinaloa - Mazatlán, Sinaloa highway. Some people claim that Clouthier's death was not an accident, but a planned attempt on his life {{by the government of}} Salinas, who had just officially won the presidential race in 1988 {{on one of the most}} controversial elections in Mexico's history, on which Cuauhtémoc Cardenas <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the winner <b>had</b> there not <b>been</b> election fraud.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian {{hemorrhagic fever}} (BzHF) is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} Sabiá virus, an Arenavirus. The Sabiá virus {{is one of the}} arenoviruses from South America to cause hemorrhagic fever. It shares a common progenitor with the Junin virus, Machupo virus, Tacaribe virus, and Guanarito virus. It is an enveloped RNA virus and is highly infectious and lethal. Very little is known about this disease, but it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>be</b> transmitted by the excreta of rodents.|$|R
5|$|The Sadhana Enclave are {{features}} Baradari an arched hall. <b>Thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{built in}} the 14th century or 15th century, {{it is in a}} fairly well preserved condition. A Lodi period tomb is also seen nearby.|$|E

50|$|Al-Asiri <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{possibly}} <b>been</b> {{killed in}} a firefight on April 20, 2014. Yemeni troops recovered bodies to run DNA tests, but the tests were not a match.|$|R
50|$|A second temple, {{described}} by {{visitors to the}} site in 1743 and 1860 and <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> disappeared, <b>was</b> later discovered by the Syrian archaeological mission near the Nahr al-Kuble spring.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, {{almost all}} pterosaurs {{were seen as}} surface-feeding piscivores, a view that still dominates popular culture. In reality, however, the {{majority}} of pterosaurs are now <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> terrestrial carnivores or insectivores.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is thought}} to be a {{captured}} dwarf planet. Phoebe is a captured body that, like Vesta, is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, but is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so early in its history.|$|E
5|$|Tunnels were {{discovered}} during the hospital's construction, <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built to allow wealthy guests staying at Larbert House, built in 1822, {{to walk to}} the nearby loch unobserved.|$|E

50|$|Engravers {{who worked}} for Jenner {{included}} Francis Delaram, William Marshall and Willem de Passe, whose wife Elizabeth <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a relation of Jenner. Jan Barra made a set of engravings for the five senses.|$|R
5|$|While long <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids {{were not}} as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Yagan is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born around 1795. His {{father was}} Midgegooroo, an elder of the Beeliar people; {{his mother was}} presumably one of Midgegooroo's two wives. Yagan was {{probably}} a Ballaroke in the Noongar classification.|$|E
5|$|A feigned retreat by the Picts {{drew the}} Northumbrians into an ambush at Dun Nechtain near the lake of Linn Garan. The battle site {{has long been}} <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> near the present-day village of Dunnichen in Angus. Recent research, however, has {{suggested}} a more northerly location near Dunachton, {{on the shores of}} Loch Insh in Badenoch and Strathspey.|$|E
50|$|The U-shaped {{structure}} <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> by some <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{used as a}} royal cremation site.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the first}} book of the Republic, which shares many {{features}} with earlier dialogues, <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originally <b>been</b> written as a separate work, and then the remaining books were conjoined to it, perhaps with modifications to the original of {{the first book}}.|$|R
50|$|He had {{two great}} tusks like a boar. It is {{generally}} a peaceful wanderer. His large feet are swathed in calico bands and are squarish in appearance. He <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> once <b>been</b> ridden {{by one of}} the Foawr, a race of stone-throwing giants.|$|R
5|$|A stone {{building}} {{to the east of}} the main complex is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the abbot's house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed.|$|E
5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or may have played a role in vocalization. The tail club is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Anwar is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{based on}} the poet Chairil Anwar, an individualistic anarchist known for being abrasive, having kleptomania, and womanizing. The poet's friend Nasjah Djamin notes that the {{characterization}} captured the real-life Anwar's nonchalance, impoliteness, and arrogance.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{now known}} as the school house was moved to the site in 1932. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> previously <b>been</b> a church, but was used as a billiards room and is sited picturesquely in a wooded area adjacent to the main house.|$|R
25|$|The Blowing Stone, a {{perforated}} sarsen stone, {{which lies}} in a garden in Kingston Lisle, two kilometres away and which produces a musical tone when blown through, <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> possibly <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> moved from the White Horse site, in 1750.|$|R
25|$|S.coleoptrata is {{indigenous}} to the Mediterranean region, {{but it has}} spread through much of Europe, Asia, North America and South America.
