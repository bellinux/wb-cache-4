As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was painted with high quality oil paint, which became the main contributor to <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of paint did not allow the limestone to dry.

5|$|Due to {{a variety}} of factors, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s.

Waller was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds needed for a building. However, this was unsuccessful and on November 19, 1862, the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, Gustavus Hines, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, J.

Ford, concerned with both {{the effect of this}} on Turkish-American relations and <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill.
