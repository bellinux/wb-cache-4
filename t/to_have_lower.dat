5|$|Tyrannosaurids, {{like their}} tyrannosauroid ancestors, were heterodont, with premaxillary teeth D-shaped {{in cross section}} and smaller than the rest. Unlike earlier tyrannosauroids and most other theropods, the maxillary and mandibular teeth of mature tyrannosaurids are not blade-like but {{extremely}} thickened and often circular in cross-section, with some species having reduced serrations. Tooth counts tend to be consistent within species, and larger species tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lower</b> tooth counts than smaller ones. For example, Alioramus had 76 to 78 teeth in its jaws, while Tyrannosaurus had between 54 and 60.|$|E
5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lower</b> life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E

25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lower</b> rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lower</b> blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. People who get more sun are generally healthier, and also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely to have a heart attack, {{than those who did not}} have these cancers.|$|E

25|$|Composting is a {{solid manure}} {{management}} system that relies on solid manure from bedded pack pens, or the solids from a liquid manure separator. There are two methods of composting, active and passive. Manure is churned periodically during active composting, whereas in passive composting it is not. Passive composting has been found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lower</b> green house gas emissions due to incomplete decomposition and lower gas diffusion rates.|$|E
