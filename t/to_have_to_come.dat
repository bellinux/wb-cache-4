500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, we are going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with a name for it. The live titles, {{you have to put}} something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to {{crossover}} with music listeners outside of reggae's market, Sly and Robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds, particularly funk and occasional hip hop music. Despite his eclectic output, Laswell himself had {{started out as a}} bass player in funk groups, an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation. Dunbar explained their approach for the album in an interview for Musician at the time, saying that [...] "We're trying to get new fans. Once they come into the funk, they're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into the reggae, because that's where we're going to take them." [...] Sly and Robbie's direction was also influenced by the supervision of Blackwell who, according to Dunbar, [...] "wanted us to make two tracks, 17 minutes long. So we cut two tracks and extended them, each side consisting of three songs. Non-stop dancing, that's the idea." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, {{longtime}} Senators owner Clark Griffith died, and his nephew, Calvin Griffith, took over. Fewer {{and fewer}} fans {{were coming to}} the ballpark, {{due in large part}} to the St. Louis Browns' move to Baltimore in 1954, causing Baltimoreans <b>to</b> stop <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Washington to see games. Because of this, Calvin Griffith developed an interest in moving the Senators to Minnesota. Attendance may not have been the sole reason Griffith wanted to move, however; in a speech to Minnesota businessmen in the 1970s, Griffith said, [...] "You only have 15,000 blacks here".|$|R
2500|$|On July 8, 2007, Ellison gave {{a speech}} in Edina, Minnesota, where he denounced Bush's {{commutation}} of Lewis Libby's sentence: [...] "If Libby gets pardoned, then {{he should not have}} the cover of the Fifth Amendment. He's going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> clean and tell the truth. Now, he could get Gonzales-itis , you know, with 71 lapses of memory within a two-hour period." [...] He also criticized Bush's White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives saying, [...] "This is basically the Department of Religious Outreach.... It's essentially a public-relations outreach arm for the Bush administration {{to reach out to the}} far right of the evangelical Christian movement. That's really all it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who were}} {{involved}} in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action. U.S President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, [...] "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide." [...] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, [...] "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered." [...] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of [...] "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing". Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, [...] "they're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to grips with what Mr. Milošević ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..." [...] In the same press conference, Clinton also claimed [...] "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide." [...] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust. CNN reported, [...] "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort." [...] President Clinton's State Department also claimed Serbian troops had committed genocide. The New York Times reported, [...] "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević." [...] The State Department also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians. In May 1996, Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested that there might be up to 100,000 Albanian fatalities." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{week after}} the liner [...] "Atlantic" [...] had docked at Southampton Sam Marlowe might have been {{observed}}--and was observed by various of the residents--sitting on a bench on the esplanade of that rising watering-place, Bingley-on-the-Sea, in Sussex. All watering-places on the south coast of England are blots on the landscape, but though I am aware that by saying it I shall offend the civic pride {{of some of the}} others--none are so peculiarly foul as Bingley-on-the-Sea. The asphalte on the Bingley esplanade is several degrees more depressing than the asphalte on other esplanades. The Swiss waiters at the Hotel Magnificent, where Sam was stopping, are in a class of bungling incompetence by themselves, the envy and despair of all the other Swiss waiters at all the other Hotels Magnificent along the coast. For dreariness of aspect Bingley-on-the-Sea stands alone. The very waves that break on its shingle seem to creep up the beach reluctantly, as if it revolted them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to such a place.|$|E

Mr Broune {{did not think that}} an offer so quixotically generous as this should be accepted. As to the German or French town, Mr Broune said that the plan was no doubt feasible, but he doubted whether the thing to be {{achieved}} was worth the terrible sacrifice demanded. He was inclined to think that Sir Felix should go to the colonies. 'That he might drink himself to death,' said Lady Carbury, who now had no secrets from Mr Broune. Sir Felix in the meantime was still in the doctor's hands upstairs. He had no doubt been very severely thrashed, but there was not in truth very much ailing him beyond the cuts on his face. He was, however, at the present moment better satisfied to be an invalid than <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of his room and to meet the world.

You can wait at our halting place of last night until you see the prince's party come along. If I am alive I shall be with them; if not, my advice to you is to ride south and to report yourself to Turenne. He will, I doubt not, either take you into his own service, or give you such strong recommendations that you will have no difficulty in obtaining a post with some officer of distinction should you wish to continue with the army. Now, I am going along our line of outposts, and I intend to reconnoitre the ground between us and the enemy. That is what Turenne would be doing were he in command here." ...|$|E
