Les cracked the shits and was abusing me. He was saying {{he wanted to go to}} Sydney. He kept saying 'the bridge'. I took this to mean he wanted to throw the girls off the bridge because he had spoken about this before. There are some bridges on the way to Sydney on the Hume Highway which have great drops." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went out}} and found Wynd and Naylor. What they <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> know already. He {{returned}} instantly, and met Campbell leaving the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "And," [...] he continued, with a lowered {{voice and}} solemn look, [...] "if Cheenbuk had not {{turned to the}} left when I <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> never would have found it." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> {{expected}} to spend my two weeks' vacation here.|$|R
6000|$|Then I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>we</b> had {{accomplished}} that morning, and explained what Darius proposed we should do, whereupon he cried heartily: ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>we</b> {{believed}} Lucilla to be. Grosse {{turned his}} head, {{and shook his}} fist at a bottle on the chimney-piece next.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody, sir, but {{an agent}} {{that wanted to}} sell you {{some kind of a}} new calendar. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> had bushels of {{calendars}} already," [...] and the boy grinned slightly.|$|E
6000|$|... "That he does," [...] I replied. [...] "He {{followed}} us until midnight, after we <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> had no shelter and {{were forced to}} sleep out of doors if we slept at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{unless he}} {{gathered}} it from what Lord Reginald foolishly <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> said nothing, of course," [...] returned Captain Fleetwood, with a soldier's habitual {{distrust of the}} wisdom of the civil arm.|$|E
60|$|But Old Jeff Hooker he throwed {{cold water}} on the whole {{business}} {{when we got to}} his blacksmith shop and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> come for.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Barbara, reflectively. [...] "I {{scarcely}} {{think he}} was. I gave him permission {{to call upon}} us, and never <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>we</b> lived." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sergeant}} was {{a friend}} of Kate's, but he looked at her as if he thought she was crazy when she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>we</b> were going.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a clearvoyant and a witch. The Missis consults him. He knows everything. But he hasn't {{done the}} Missis any good yet, though she's paid him {{hundreds}} of dollars. But {{he told us}} that the stars <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> could find you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Turnips, you knows, sir. We always calls 'em 'nips in cargo. At the Havana I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> took {{in leather}} and jerked beef, and came home. Oh! he got nothin' from me, Capt. Spike, that'll ever do the brig a morsel of harm!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He’s {{the son of}} {{a friend}} o’ mine what I’ve brought aboard to oblige," [...] replied the skipper. [...] "He’s got a fancy for being a pirate, so just to oblige his father I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> was a pirate. He wouldn’t have come if I hadn’t." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> {{were from}} Pan-America, {{but he only}} {{shook his head and}} asked where that was. He had never heard of it, or of the Atlantic Ocean which I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{separated}} his country from mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at the time, I {{give you}} my word!" [...] replied Brice quickly, {{thinking}} only of loyalty to his old comrade. [...] "I never <b>told</b> <b>him</b> till <b>we</b> reached the station." ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> {{would go}} out into the world {{together}}; empty-handed we would fare forth together and defy the world. I said that he should be my knight-errant, my paladin! ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> {{would talk}} farther about it; that I {{had such a}} thought in my head, and a strong {{inclination}} to undertake it myself, but that I could not answer it to leave the ships, which depended so much upon my care of the voyage.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{looked at}} me with his black eyes, almost as if he hated me, when he was ill, and said, 'It only wanted this. It only wanted that I should leave you and a young child to starve in this London.' I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> should not starve. But I was young, and foolish, and frightened, which he knew.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know who}} they meant, but they all laughed. And {{every now and again}} I'd hear them praising the food, which I don't wonder at, for Jules had {{certainly}} done himself proud. All artistic temperament, these Frenchmen are. The moment I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> had company, so to speak, he blossomed like a flower does when you put it in water.|$|E
60|$|He told us many anecdotes of the Revolution, and {{was much}} pleased when <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> {{had read the}} same in history, and that his account agreed with the written.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the fewest}} words {{possible}} I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> had heard, and when I was {{come to an}} end of the brief recital, Jacob asked, as if believing that now all our plans would be changed: ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{editorial}} cartoon on Canada-United States relations, 1886. It reads: Mrs. Britannia.—"Is it possible, my dear, {{that you}} have ever given your cousin Jonathan any encouragement?" [...] Miss Canada.—"Encouragement! Certainly not, Mamma. I have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> can never be united." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] Ward called, {{instantly}} {{understanding the}} situation. [...] "They're gone. The {{old man was}} about played out, for they've been fighting snow all day, but I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> couldn't {{take care of them}} here and they have gone on down to the camp. He thinks you got over the divide. You are all right for the present." ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{in order}} to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> must divide the prisoners, {{and that he should}} go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was {{committed}} to Friday, and the two men who came on shore with the captain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess about}} all it needs is rest," [...] {{answered}} Lester Lawrence. [...] "It {{was quite a}} journey from my shack to this place. But I saw that Phil was getting anxious to rejoin you, so I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> might as well make the venture to-day rather than wait. He has been hoping {{that you would have}} some word for him from my brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> had heard, {{and when}} I {{mentioned}} {{the name of}} the traitor, he brought his hand down on his leg with a resounding thwack that might have been heard some distance away, as he said incautiously loud: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the use of}} that?" [...] Dan asked petulantly. [...] "You can be sure Jip Collins ain't {{anywhere}} 'round here, 'cause some of the fellers have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> said {{long before}} this, an' he'll give the place a wide berth." ...|$|R
60|$|I agreed heartily with him, {{and then}} I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> {{had found in}} his absence, that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. March {{came away}} {{tingling}} with compassion for their evident anxiety, and this pity naturally soured into {{a sense of}} injury. [...] "Well, I must say I have completely lost confidence in Mr. Fulkerson's judgment. Anything more utterly different from what I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> wanted I couldn't imagine. If he doesn't manage any better about his business than he has done about this, {{it will be a}} perfect failure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Will Morrison in New York, Hannah," [...] {{he said to}} his wife. [...] "He {{was just}} sailing for London with his family and will remain abroad all summer. He wanted us to occupy his {{mountain}} place, Hillcrest Lodge, during July and August, and although I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> couldn't use the place he insisted on my taking an order on his man to turn the shack over to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The captain {{proposed}} {{waiting a}} spell; but I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> weren't {{like to see}} any rougher weather than we'd pulled through together, and if we didn't know one another after such a year as this, we never should. I was sure I shouldn't be worth my pay without this hand on the wheel; so I had my way, and my brave little woman has shipped for the long voyage. God bless her!' ...|$|E
60|$|When he finished, {{we asked}} a few {{questions}} about the queen, and finding that Goliah admitted her claims to royal blood, <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> proposed to do, and boldly asked {{him to take the}} position of prime minister in the African community.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brough {{of course}} was made aware of my {{approaching}} marriage, as of everything else relating to every clerk in the office; and I do believe Abednego <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> had for dinner every day. Indeed, his knowledge of our affairs was wonderful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hitherto he {{had only}} spoken a few words; but he now briefly {{expressed}} his deep gratitude to Simmonds and myself. <b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> would ride over to see him shortly, and hoped to find him getting on rapidly. Another minute and he was gone.|$|R
