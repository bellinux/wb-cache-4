40|$|The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) {{is a low}} {{aspect ratio}} spherical torus (ST) located at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). Fabrication, assembly, and initial power tests were {{completed}} in February of 1999. The majority of the design and construction efforts were constructed on the Torus system components. The Torus system includes the centerstack assembly, external Poloidal and Toroidal coil systems, vacuum vessel, torus support structure and plasma facing components (PFC's). NSTX's low aspect ratio required that the centerstack be made with the smallest radius possible. This, {{and the need to}} bake NSTXs carbon-carbon composite plasma facing components at 350 degrees C, was major drivers in the design of NSTX. The Centerstack Assembly consists of the inner legs of the Toroidal Field (TF) windings, the Ohmic Heating (OH) solenoid and its associated <b>tension</b> <b>cylinder,</b> three inner Poloidal Field (PF) coils, thermal insulation, diagnostics and an Inconel casing which forms the inner wall of the vacuum vessel boundary. It took approximately nine months to complete the assembly of the Centerstack. The tight radial clearances and the extreme length of the major components added complexity to the assembly of the Centerstack components. The vacuum vessel was constructed of 304 -stainless steel and required approximately seven months to complete and deliver to the Test Cell. Several of the issues associated with the construction of the vacuum vessel were control of dimensional stability following welding and controlling the permeability of the welds. A great deal of time and effort was devoted to defining the correct weld process and material selection to meet our design requirements. The PFCs will be baked out at 350 degrees C while the vessel is maintained at 150 degrees C. This required care in designing the supports so they can accommodate the high electromagnetic loads resulting from plasma disruptions and the resulting relative thermal expansions between the PFC's and the vacuum vessel on which supports are attached. This paper will provide a brief review of the issues associated with the design, fabrication and assembly of the NSTX Torus system including those outlined above...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} global {{finite element}} simulations of a hydro-pneumatic riser <b>tension</b> <b>cylinder</b> used for tensioning and heave compensating of marine drilling risers. The global {{finite element models}} are made for use on a personal computer, which give some limits in available computational capacity, but convenient {{for use of the}} models. The main goal for the simulations is to find the contact forces acting between the cylinder rod surface layer and the bearing rings inside the stuffing box of the cylinder. This information is needed to understand the reasons for the excessive wear of surface layers that has been experienced and lead to costly damages of heave compensation systems. To establish the models a literature study of riser analysis, heave compensation and friction between surfaces modelling is done and described. Measurement of friction forces in order to identify the Stribeck curve for the bearing material has been done on a test cylinder, lubricated with a fire resistant water glycol hydraulic fluid. The friction force is measured as a function of contact pressure and speed at different temperature, which are the parameters needed to define the Stribeck curve for the actual system. The size of the bearing and the difference in friction force between boundary lubrication friction and mixed lubrication friction described by the Stribeck curve, bring in modelling issues for the time domain analysis. The size of the bearing requires small finite elements, which in turn requires very short time increments in order to obtain stable time integration when using an explicit method. The fast variation in friction force gives convergence issues also for the implicit integration method. Computational costs are therefore high for the applied type of simulation. The results show that metal to metal contact between cylinder rod and stuffing box may occur in certain situations even within the design limit of cylinder, due to high contact pressure and bending of the rod. The main contributing factors to this high contact pressure and bending are: • Bending moments in the cylinder and rod occur due to weight of the structure when it has a spatial inclination relative to the vertical. • Lateral accelerations of the cylinder ends due to vessel and drilling riser motions. • Low bending stiffness of the cylinder rod when the riser tension is low...|$|E

Then the next hoop (either B2 or C1) is similarly heated so the assembled A tube and B1 jacket can be lowered into position for a successive shrink fit.

The test matrix included towing the cyl-inder at various speeds, towing the cylinder in regular waves, and investigating the infl uence of partial coverage on the response behavior. The test cylinder was 29 m long with a length to diameter (L/D) ratio of ~ 760.

The time domain decomposition method (TDD) was used to recover mode shapes, damping characteristics, and modal contribution factors. For the uniform current cases, the fi ndings illustrate that ribbon fairings are effective and provide increased damping when compared with bare cylinders. Partial coverage demonstrates that localized suppression becomes increasingly less effective as the percentage coverage is reduced.

5000|$|The {{innermost}} cylinder {{forming the}} chamber and rifled bore {{is called a}} tube or, with certain construction techniques, a liner. A second layer cylinder called the jacket extends rearward past the chamber to house the breechblock. The jacket usually extends forward through the areas of highest pressure, through the recoil slide, and may extend {{all the way to}} the muzzle. The forward part of the barrel may be tapered toward the muzzle because less strength is required for reduced pressures as the projectile approaches it. This tapered portion of barrel is called the chase. Very large guns sometimes use shorter outer cylinders called hoops when manufacturing limitations make full length jackets impractical. Hoops forward of the slide are called chase hoops. [...] The jacket or forward chase hoop may be flared outward in the form of a bell at the muzzle for extra strength to reduce splitting because the metal at that point is not supported on the forward end. [...] As many as four or five layers, or hoop courses, of successively <b>tensioned</b> <b>cylinders</b> have been used. [...] Layers are designated alphabetically as the [...] "A" [...] tube enclosed by the [...] "B" [...] jacket and chase hoops, enclosed by the [...] "C" [...] hoop course, enclosed by the [...] "D" [...] hoop course, etc. Individual hoops within a course are numbered from the breech forward as the B1 jacket, the B2 chase hoop, and then the C1 jacket hoop, the C2 hoop etc. [...] Successive hoop course joints are typically staggered and individual hoop courses use lap joints in preference to butt joints to minimize the weakness of joint locations. Cylinder diameter may be varied by including machined shoulders to prevent forward longitudinal movement of an inner cylinder within an outer cylinder during firing. Shoulder locations are similarly staggered to minimize weakness.|$|R

A Tension Leg Platform (TLP) is a floating deep-water compliant structure that utilizes a system of slender vertical tensioned structural members, i. e. tendons, to provide station keeping. In the past most emphasis has been placed on understanding the global response behavior. In this study emphasis is placed upon attempting to understand the response behavior of closely spaced tendons in wave flows. In this study, two adjacent vertical <b>tensioned</b> <b>cylinders</b> are idealized as two Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) systems and their interaction is idealized as nonlinear spring-dashpot system. A spectral analysis technique developed by Bendat and Piersol (1993), which makes use of a reverse dynamic system, is used in this study. The significant feature of the technique is conversion of the original, difficult-to-analyze nonlinear problem into a straightforward linear problem. At the same time, an analytical linear transfer function was developed under the Gaussian wave assumption for comparison with the measured data. The developed model and the interaction behavior are estimated based upon the experimental data from Rijken (1997). Three important nonlinear cases in structural vibrations were examined. Linear and nonlinear impedance function were obtained for three different spacings. Ordinary and cumulative coherence functions were estimated and compared for goodness-of-fit of the model. From the study, one observes that as the cylinder spacing increases the difference in total force measured on the upstream and downstream cylinder decreases. The simulation results show that the interaction behavior is none of the three classical nonlinear cases. This confirms that the modeling nonlinear interactions observed in the data will require a more complicated model...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} primarily {{focuses on}} understanding the canonical problem of vortex-induced vibration (VIV), a self-excited vibration of bluff bodies {{caused by the}} instability of the bluff-body wake. In this work, dynamic response and active control of low mode number flexible cylinders undergoing vortex-induced vibrations are addressed which has potential to significantly impact the development of predictive models for flow-induced-vibrations, a topic of critical importance to the offshore {{oil and gas industry}} and important to the cost-effective development of new ocean structures, such as floating offshore wind platforms and offshore wind energy systems. ^ In the tests, first, dynamic response of a <b>tensioned</b> flexible <b>cylinder</b> is investigated in a recirculating flow channel. Different than hysteresis in the amplitude response, the idea of mode hysteresis is introduced. A transition in the amplitude of the response of a flexible cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibrations is shown {{to be related to the}} transition between fluid coupled structural modes excited by the flow. Also, due to the symmetric drag loading across cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s span, the hypothesis of being unable to sustain a asymmetric excitation (even mode excitation) in in-line is discussed. To understand more about this fluid-structure interactions, <b>tensioned</b> flexible <b>cylinder</b> data is used for multivariate analysis. It is shown that traditional reduced order models such as proper orthogonal decomposition and recently introduced smooth orthogonal decomposition methods help to identify nonlinear mode interactions in the flexible cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s response. Later, mode shape effect in VIV and the idea of being unable to sustain asymmetric modes in a uniform flow is considered. In the tests, three bending-dominated cylinders are tested with varying stiffness in the cross-flow and in-line directions of the cylinder in order to produce varying structural mode shapes associated with a fixed 2 : 1 (in-line:cross-flow) natural frequency ratio. Then, the structural mode excitation of bending-dominated flexible cylinders undergoing vortex-induced vibrations is investigated using multivariate analysis of excited empirical modes. Both the analytic and experimental results show that for excitation of low mode numbers, the cylinder is unlikely to oscillate with an even mode shape in the in-line direction due to symmetric drag loading, even when the system is tuned to have an even mode at the expected frequency of vortex shedding. Later, to understand the effect of three-dimensional wake on an oscillating flexible cylinder in VIV, a novel experimental method is introduced. Finally, the idea of active control of flexible cylinders in VIV using piezo stripe actuators is discussed. Piezo stripe actuators are bonded at the anti-nodes of a flexible cylinder in the in-line direction to control low vibration modes (i. e. first, second and third).

40|$|A long elastic cylinder, radius a and shear-modulus μ, becomes {{unstable}} given sufficient {{surface tension}} γ. We show this instability can be simply understood {{by considering the}} energy, E(λ), of such a cylinder subject to a homogenous longitudinal stretch λ. Although E(λ) has a unique minimum, if surface tension is sufficient (Γ≡γ/(aμ) >√(32)) it looses convexity in a finite region. We use a Maxwell construction to show that, if stretched into this region, the cylinder will phase separate into two segments with different stretches λ_ 1 and λ_ 2. Our model thus explains why the instability has infinite wavelength, and allows us to calculate the instability's sub-critical hysteresis loop (as a function of imposed stretch), showing that instability proceeds with constant amplitude and at constant (positive) <b>tension</b> as the <b>cylinder</b> is stretched between λ_ 1 and λ_ 2. We use full nonlinear finite-element calculations to verify these predictions, and to characterize the interface between the two phases. Near Γ=√(32) the length of such an interface diverges introducing a new length-scale and allowing us to construct a 1 -D effective theory. This treatment yields an analytic expression for the interface itself, revealing its characteristic length grows as l_wall∼ a/√(Γ-√(32)) ...|$|R

40|$|Magneto-active {{elastomers}} {{are smart}} materials {{composed of a}} rubber-like matrix material containing a distribution of magneto active particles. The large elastic deformations possible in the rubber-like matrix allow the mechanical properties of magneto-active elastomers to be changed significantly by the application of external magnetic fields. In this paper, we provide a theoretical basis for {{the description of the}} nonlinear properties of a particular class of these materials, namely transversely isotropic magneto-active elastomers. The transversely isotropic character of thesematerials is produced by the application of a magnetic field during the curing process, when the magneto active particles are distributed within the rubber. As a result the particles are aligned in chains that generated a preferred direction in the material. Available experimental data suggest that this enhances the stiffness of the material in the presence of an external magnetic field by comparison with the situation inwhich no external field is applied during curing, which leads to an essentially random (isotropic) distribution of particles. Herein, we develop a general form of the constitutive law for such magnetoelastic solids. This is then used in the solution of two simple problems involving homogeneous deformations, namely simple shear of a slab and simple <b>tension</b> of a <b>cylinder.</b> Using these results and the experimental available data we develop a prototype constitutive equation, which is used in order to solve two boundary-value problems involving non-homogeneous deformations—the extension and inflation of a circular cylindrical tube and the extension and torsion of a solid circular cylinder...|$|R

This research study focused on wave-current interaction with a single, flexible cylinder representative of a riser in 500 in (1640 ft) of water. Realistic environmental conditions were obtained by combining wave and current conditions which were based upon advise from the offshore industry. These tests provided unique data at large model scales. The experiments were conducted in the deepwater wave basin at the Offshore Technology Research Center (OTRC) at Texas A&M University. As part of the experimental study, a new underwater video tracking technique was developed to directly measure the inline and transverse displacement fields of the riser. Other standard instrumentation was also used to determine the <b>cylinder</b> <b>tension</b> and reaction forces. The validity of the underwater tracking methodology was assessed and this established an alternative to strain gage measurement which will prove valuable for future riser experiments. The wave and current environments selected were characterized separately before combined testing. The wave spectra with and without the presence of current compared consistently with previous mathematical models. The inline riser displacements were compared to predicted response envelopes, using a standard, two dimensional, finite element model. The program is based on linear theory to obtain the wave kinematics and uses Morison's equation to model external forcing due to waves. Additional terms were included into Morison's equation to account for current as well as mean drift due to mass transport. The results obtained using this simulation model were discussed and choices for added mass and drag coefficients were motivated. The riser simulations reproduced response envelope trends quite accurately when current was superimposed onto the various waves conditions...|$|R
