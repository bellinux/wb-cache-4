25|$|The all-wood wing pairs {{comprised}} {{a single}} structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There {{was a single}} continuous main spar and another continuous rear spar. Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this rear spar {{was one of the}} most complex units <b>to</b> <b>laminate</b> and to finish machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.|$|E
25|$|Knife blades can be {{manufactured}} {{from a variety}} of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Carbon steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, possibly nickel, and molybdenum, with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminate blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Pattern-welding is similar <b>to</b> <b>laminate</b> construction. Layers of different steel types are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.|$|E
30|$|Results also {{revealed}} that the mean CBSS of the brackets bonded <b>to</b> <b>laminates</b> treated with diamond bur was 90.8 % from their SSBS mean. Next were the brackets bonded <b>to</b> <b>laminates</b> treated with microetcher, as the mean of CSBS was 88.35 % of their SSBS mean. The CBSS to the SSBS means {{for the control group}} and the brackets bonded <b>to</b> <b>laminates</b> treated with phosphoric acid were 76.19 % and 63.22 %, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Highest CSBS {{values were}} also {{recorded}} with the brackets bonded <b>to</b> <b>laminates</b> treated with diamond bur followed with those treated with microetcher (5.85 ± 0.03 and 5.31 ± 0.04 MPa, respectively), with no statistical {{significant difference between}} them. On the other hand, the lowest CSBS values were recorded for the CSBS of the brackets bonded <b>to</b> <b>laminates</b> treated with phosphoric acid and then the control group (3.25 ± 0.03 and 3.84 ± 0.93, MPa respectively). Both groups showed {{a statistically significant difference}} with the CSBS of brackets bonded <b>to</b> <b>laminates</b> treated with diamond bur and those treated with microetcher (P < 0.05).|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of large format printing using inkjet printers {{have given a}} cheaper alternative <b>to</b> decorative <b>laminates,</b> minus the quality. For most uninformed consumers, the large format printing are similar <b>to</b> <b>laminates,</b> and seem <b>to</b> offer more variety of designs and applications. For example, large format prints can be printed on wall stickers, and then installed on walls. Unlike decorative laminates, there are no special adhesive to be used, and the price may sometimes seem so much cheaper comparatively.|$|R
25|$|Work on {{the glass}} panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates {{to assist with the}} {{selection}} of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them—representing a wide diversity of voices spread through time—were used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water jet cutter to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass fabricator (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized bus shelter glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art abrasive blasting to etch the photo-realistic images into the glass. Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, <b>to</b> <b>laminate</b> the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size.|$|E
