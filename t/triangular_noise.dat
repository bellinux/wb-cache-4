5000|$|Japanese {{broadcast}} {{engineers had}} studied {{many kinds of}} HDTV broadcasts for long time. At first {{it was thought that}} SHF, EHF or optic fiber would have to be used to transmit HDTV due to the high bandwidth of the signal, and HLO-PAL would be used for terrestrial broadcast. HLO-PAL is a conventionally constructed composite signal (Y+C, like NTSC and PAL). It uses a Phase Alternating by Line with Half-Line Offset carrier encoding of the wideband/narrowband chroma components. Only the very lowest part of the wideband chroma component overlapped the high-frequency chroma. The narrowband chroma was completely separated from luminance. PAF, or Phase Alternating by Field (like the first NTSC color system trial) was also experimented with, and gave much better decoding results, but NHK abandoned all composite encoding systems. Because of the use of satellite transmission, Frequency modulation(FM) should be used with power-limitation problem. FM incurs <b>triangular</b> <b>noise,</b> so if a sub-carrierred composite signal is used with FM, demodulated chroma signal has more noise than luminance. Because of this they studied and decided to use Y/C component emission for satellite. At one stage, it seemed that FCFE (Frame Conversion Fineness Enhanced), I/P conversion compression system, would be chosen, but MUSE was adopted in the end.|$|E
40|$|Three {{techniques}} {{for improving the}} performance of discriminator detection of digital FM are presented. In the first technique, use is made of detection theory to develop an efficient scheme for detecting the occurrence of a click and for correcting its effects in the demodulated signal. The second technique is used to combat the <b>triangular</b> <b>noise.</b> An improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio in the decoder is achieved by filtering the demodulated signal. The interest of the proposed method lies {{in the use of}} partial response encoding technique in the receiver to perform this filtering operation. The third technique counteracts nonlinear distortion by taking advantage of maximum likelihood sequence estimation. It leads to a reduced state Viterbi decoder. A specific example is given in which these three methods are successfully applied at the same timePeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a seminal}} paper {{published}} in the AES Journal, Lipshitz and Vanderkooy pointed out that different noise types, with different probability density functions (PDFs) behave differently when used as dither signals, and suggested optimal levels of dither signal for audio. Gaussian noise requires {{a higher level of}} added noise for full elimination of distortion than do rectangular PDF or <b>triangular</b> PDF <b>noise.</b> <b>Triangular</b> PDF <b>noise</b> also minimizes [...] "noise modulation" [...] - audible changes in the volume level of residual noise behind quiet music that draw attention to the noise.|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate disturbance and noisiness of periodically non-steady noises in four task conditions. Totally 326 subjects participated in experiments. There were two main variables : the range of level fluctuation was from 0 to 40 dB and the repetition rate varied from 0. 25 to 4 Hz. The noises were exposed at two levels, 60 and 70 dB Leq. Task conditions were articulation test, intelligibility test, calculation, and reading, and their exposure durations were respectively about 6, 8, 3, 2. 5 minutes. The task performance was investigated and the relation between disturbance or noisiness and performance was also discussed. The conclusions are summarized as follows. 1) In task conditions in which task performance is significantly affected by noises, disturbance and noisiness are influenced considerably by performance and have high correlation with it. 2) In task conditions in which task performance is not significantly affected by noises, disturbance and noisiness increase with range of level fluctuation. 3) In the same conditions as 2), the effect of repetition rate was not reasonably found, but consistently disturbance or noisiness tends to rise at 1 Hz {{in the case of}} <b>triangular</b> <b>noises</b> and ã€€drop at 1 Hz in rectangular noises. 4) It is considered that the complex effect of repetition rate as mentioned above is contributed by the interference of concentration on task and the rhythm of task exept for the effect of fluctuation factors...|$|R
50|$|FM stereo {{broadcasting}} {{is known}} to incur up to a 23 dB noise penalty over that of monophonic FM broadcasting; {{this is due to}} the combination of the <b>triangular</b> FM <b>noise</b> spectrum and the wider baseband bandwidth occupied by the stereo multiplex signal. Developed at the CBS Technology Center, FMX was intended to improve this characteristic for listeners in the fringe areas where the noise penalty would be worst. This improvement was achieved by adding an amplitude-compressed version of the L&minus;R (left-minus-right, or difference) signal modulated in quadrature with the stereo subcarrier, using a version of the CX noise-reduction system originally developed at CBS for LP records.|$|R
40|$|It is {{clarified}} that Leq {{is available}} for slowly fluctuating noise what is called fluctuating noise. But the evaluation method of rapidly fluctuating noise, for example, impulsive or intermittent noise, is not yet established. In this experiment, three periodically non-steady noises-triangular, sinusoidal and rectangular noises-were used as test stimuli, the factors of level fluctuation-repetition rate (RR) and range of level fluctuation (W) -were set up widely from fluctuating noise to impulsive and intermittent noise, and PSE (point of subjective equality), which was steady noise level equivalent to non-steady noise on noisiness, was searched for by constant method. The relation between PSE and fluctuation factors was investigated to obtain fundamental data to evaluate general non-steady noises on noisiness. The results and discussions are summerized as follows. 1) The PSEs of periodically triangular, sinusoidal and rectangular noises are significantly affected by RR and W. 2) <b>Triangular</b> and sinusoidal <b>noises</b> indicate similar tendency on noisiness and their PSEs can be represented by L_eq {{and the effect of}} level fluctuation, which is indicated as a function of RR and W by equation (4). 3) The PSEs of rectangular noises are larger than those of <b>triangular</b> and sinusoidal <b>noises...</b>|$|R
