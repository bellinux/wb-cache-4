The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only {{so long as the}} older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{marketing}} {{has been}} criticized for not advertising it as a musical. Michael Halberstam of the Writers' Theatre said, [...] "By de-emphasizing the score <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>they</b> did in the trailer, it is possible the producers were condescending to us – a tactic which cannot ultimately end in anything but tears." [...] In the UK, a number of audience members walked out of the film on realizing it was a musical, and complaints that advertisements for the film were deliberately misleading were made to both the Advertising Standards Authority and Trading Standards agency. The studios involved opted for a low-key approach to their marketing. Producer Walter Parkes stated, [...] "All these things that could be described as difficulties could also be the movie's greatest strengths." [...] Warner Bros. felt it should take a similar approach to marketing as with The Departed, with little early exposure and discouraging talk of awards.|$|E

60|$|SIR:--The {{application}} made {{to me by}} your adjutant {{general for}} authority to call out the militia of the State of Pennsylvania has received careful consideration. It is my anxious desire to afford, as far as possible, the means {{and power of the}} Federal Government to protect the State of Pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces; and since, in your judgment, the militia of the State are required, and have been called upon by you, to organize for home defense and protection, I sanction the call that you have made, and will receive them into the service and pay of the United States <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>they</b> can be armed, equipped, and usefully employed. The arms and equipments now belonging to the General Government will be needed for the troops called out for the national armies, so that arms can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by the draft of nine months' men, heretofore ordered. But as arms may be supplied by the militia under your call, these, with the 30,000 in your arsenal, will probably be sufficient for the purpose contemplated by your call. You will be authorized to provide such equipments as may be required, according to the regulations of the United States service, which, upon being turned over to the United States Quartermaster's Department, will be paid for at regulation prices, or the rates allowed by the department for such articles. Railroad transportation will also be paid for, as in other cases. Such general officers will be supplied as the exigencies of the service will permit.|$|E
