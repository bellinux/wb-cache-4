5|$|In 1368, a Han Chinese revolt {{known as}} the Red Turban Rebellion toppled the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang then {{established}} the Ming dynasty, ruling as the Hongwu Emperor (r.1368–1398). It {{is not clear how}} much the early Ming court understood the civil war going on in Tibet between rival religious sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> Tibet had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders to renew their titles for the new Ming court.|$|E
5|$|During another {{summer with}} his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter and Dudley are {{attacked}} by Dementors. After using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, {{but the decision}} is later rescinded. Harry is whisked off {{by a group of}} wizards (including the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, and several new faces, including Nymphadora Tonks, a bubbly young witch who is a Metamorphmagus , and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a senior Auror who believes everyone is equal) to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the former home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Lupin, Mad-Eye, and Sirius are members. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order of the Phoenix is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. From the members of the Order, Harry and the others learn that Voldemort is seeking an object {{that he did not have}} prior to his first defeat, and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> doing so would cause, and has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore.|$|E
5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E

However, CBS would replace Heart on March 26, 1973 with the youth-oriented The Young and the Restless, causing Password and Jeopardy! to hit ratings <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> Summer—in large measure due to the college and high school-aged viewers being lured away from the intellectual pair to the serial.|$|E

25|$|Doom {{beat the}} Steiner Brothers at Capital Combat; {{at that point}} in time, the Steiners didn't lose very often. Doom won the tag team titles and quickly set about {{defending}} them against the former champions the Steiners as well the rest of WCW’s very talented tag team division. In the fall of 1990, Doom soon feuded with The Four Horsemen and defended against them in two inconclusive tag team title matches at Halloween Havoc 1990 and Starrcade 1990. At , Doom lost a non-title match to Sting and Lex Luger in a match that foreshadowed the <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> lay ahead.|$|E

By the time the Brisbane Broncos entered the New South Wales Rugby League in 1988, they were in financial <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> only got worse as the years progressed. They were forced out of their traditional home at Corbett Park by financial administrators, and after temporarily playing out of Crosby Park, they relocated to Bray Park, renaming the club Pine Rivers Brothers. In 1998, they moved back to Brisbane under the name Brisbane Brothers and became a feeder club to the Broncos, before closing at season's end.|$|E
25|$|Going {{into the}} last race of the season at Homestead, only three drivers could win the Chase. Kenseth trailed Jimmie Johnson by 28 points and led Kevin Harvick by 5 points for second. Kenseth won the pole. Harvick started in 6th and Johnson in 7th positions. At the start, Kenseth had the {{dominate}} car. He led a race high 144 laps to get the bonus point. The only <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> Kenseth had was on the restart after a caution with 74 laps remaining. He was behind Jeff Gordon, who spun his tires causing an accordion effect. Cars scattered everywhere. Kenseth and Johnson bumped each other causing Kenseth to drop to 12th and Johnson down to 26th. Kenseth {{made his way back}} up to finish in 2nd behind his teammate Denny Hamlin. Johnson finished in 9th place to win the 2013 championship, beating Kenseth by 19 points. Kenseth finished second in the final points standings also.|$|E

25|$|The Lightning {{picked up}} goalscorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the 1996 off-season, {{and he did}} not disappoint, scoring 35 goals in the 1996–97 season, with Chris Gratton {{notching}} another 30 goals. The team moved into a glittering new arena, the Ice Palace (now the Amalie Arena), and appeared destined for another playoff spot. However, the Lightning suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> kept him out of all but four games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in 2000. Bradley also lost time to a series of injuries that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. Center John Cullen developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and missed the last 12 games of the 1996–97 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. It would be seven years before the Lightning would even come close to the playoffs again.|$|E
25|$|Zheng Zhi {{started his}} {{football}} career in 1990 playing for various Liaoning youth academies before playing for Liaoning Youth in 1998 {{where he started}} out playing as a defender. Despite being the reserve side of Liaoning Whowin, the Liaoning Youth team were allowed {{to take part in}} the third tier where they found it difficult within the league system and the club were involved in legal <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> saw all their assets frozen, including player transfer rights. This saw Zheng spend a year without playing professional football and he was transferred to top tier club Shenzhen Jianlibao who were coached by then manager Zhu Guanghu, his former manager during his time with the Chinese under-23 national team. While he was initially deployed as a defender at first, he successfully made the transition as a playmaker and aided Shenzhen to the 2004 league title for the first time in the club's history. After the title win, Zheng would play for the Chinese national team at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup where then manager Arie Haan deployed him as a defender once again as China finished as runners-up in the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Simon Bodger (Andy Cunningham) - Simon Bodger is a {{handyman}} {{who has had}} various jobs {{throughout the}} series, probably because when he is nervous he makes silly mistakes and Badger's antics repeatedly get him sacked. In the first series he {{was working as a}} cook for Troff's Nosherama. He got sacked after Badger accidentally revealed himself to praise Mr Troff for giving Simon the job of chef. In the second and third series he was a caretaker at the (fictional) Letsby Avenue Junior School. This is not far from Troffs' Nosherama, as the Letsby Avenue football team are referenced in the first episode of series one. In the fourth series he was a handyman and zookeeper at Chessington World of Adventures. In the fifth, sixth and seventh series he was seemingly unemployed and renting a flat, occasionally working as a casual handyman to his landlady, Mrs Dribelle. In the eighth and ninth series he was manager of his own Bed and Breakfast while a relative who owned it went on a round-the-world trip. Badger is his anthropomorphic talking pet and best friend, although all the <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> Bodger ends up in is usually down to Badger. Regular gags usually involve Badger covering Bodger in mashed potato or some other messy substance, either intentionally or accidentally.|$|E

[...] Parker and the casting department had difficulty finding an actress for the role of Hilary Van Doren. Antonia Franceschi, who had previously acted as a background dancer in the musical Grease (1978), secured the role based on the strength of her audition. Meg Tilly appears in her acting debut as a principal dancer. In his first credited screen role, Peter Rafelson, son of Bob Rafelson, appears as a principal musician and vocalist.|$|E

[...] Eventually, the sheer scope of the episode caused co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin so much <b>trouble</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to scrap the story.
