5|$|Miller {{attended}} the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted <b>the</b> <b>spectators</b> to call him The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, {{and was forced to}} repeat the year.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training, regularly retreating {{to the mountains}} or performing misogi in the Nachi Falls. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 {{he was asked to}} give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, at the behest of Admiral Isamu Takeshita; one of <b>the</b> <b>spectators</b> was Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art. After a couple of weeks, however, Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not <b>the</b> <b>spectators.</b> The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not make them feel very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause.

Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Rindt {{switched}} to Formula Junior {{with the assistance}} of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria's leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old Cooper T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in Vallelunga, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at Cesenatico. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost crashing into <b>the</b> <b>spectators</b> at a race in the streets of Budapest.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen {{it turns out to}} be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it but one of <b>the</b> <b>spectators,</b> The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a cash prize, {{the winner of the}} tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon {{after the end of the}} tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of <b>the</b> <b>spectators.</b> Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.|$|E

5|$|National {{competitions}} generally {{last one}} week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed {{the greatest number}} of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to <b>the</b> <b>spectators</b> for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.|$|E
5|$|On the day decreed, Le Gris and Carrouges {{travelled}} through Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in the city's Northern suburbs.

The production team was allotted seven minutes to set up the stage, 12 minutes for the performance and eight minutes to take down the stage. The modular structure was assembled from a truck, with a large white fabric in front as media screens for Moment Factory. Projection mapping was used by video-hardware manufacturer Barco, with films modified for <b>the</b> <b>spectators</b> and the television audience. The stadium was equipped with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky, and the show used Sennheiser sound equipment.|$|E
