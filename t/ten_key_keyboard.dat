40|$|The {{research}} examined distributed {{computer based}} process control systems. A functional analysis {{was done to}} identify the subunits that make up such a system. They are: i) a communication system ii) a distributed database iii) a presentation system for a) the process b) the process engineer c) the process operator Each of these subunits is discussed in detail in chapters 3 - 7. An economic analysis was also carried out to determine the optimum distribution of the control task. It was concluded that, on present costs, each controller should contain eight control loops. The controllers and man machine interfaces should be distributed along a multidrop communications line. Based on these analyses, a system was implemented within the department. It used an M 6800 microcomputer for the controller and the departmental PDP 11 minicomputer for the man machine interfaces. The result proved to be effective, especially the process operator's interface. This used a colour graphics CRT with touch sensitive screen and <b>ten</b> <b>key</b> <b>keyboard.</b> This input system minimised training and, combined with the three level hierarchical displays, provided an efficient work station...|$|E
50|$|The Roland MC-4 MicroComposer was {{an early}} {{microprocessor-based}} music sequencer released by the Roland Corporation. It could be programmed using the <b>ten</b> <b>key</b> numeric <b>keyboard</b> or a synthesizer keyboard using the keyboards control voltage and gate outputs. It was released in 1981 with a list price of US$3,295 (Â¥430,000 JPY) and was the successor to the MC-8, which in 1977 was the first microprocessor-based digital sequencer. Like its predecessor, the MC-4 is a polyphonic CV/Gate sequencer.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is threefold. The first purpose is to review the literature on the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components of an ideal model for the administration of drug courts. The model and its components were developed by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. The second purpose is to assess the extent to which Texas Drug Courts meet the criteria of the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components. The third purpose is to provide recommendations to Texas Drug Courts on implementing the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components. Method. The method relied upon for this applied research project is the survey instrument which was the sole method of data collection. The survey was sent to fifty-one Texas Drug Courts to measure the degree of adherence to the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components. Results. Approximately 33 % of Texas Drug Courts responded to the survey. Of the responses, most courts adhered to the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components. Some key components had better adherence rates than others but approximately 50 % of the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components met the 80 % benchmark set by the author. Conclusion. The recommendations made to Texas Drug Courts are consistent with applying the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components as set forth by the NADCP. The recommendations also include consolidating some components and creating two additional components: a funding component and a State Drug Court Office component. Overall, Texas Drug Courts do adhere to the <b>Ten</b> <b>Key</b> Components, but some components are adhered to more than others. ...|$|R
