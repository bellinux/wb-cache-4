40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the breast, a well-differentiated {{variant of}} infiltrating ductal carcinoma, has been {{regarded}} as a very favorable histologic subtype. The infrequency of nodal metastases and low recurrence rates have led to questions {{about the value of}} axillary dissection. OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the frequency of axillary nodal metastases, the prognostic value of histologic features of the primary tumor, and treatment outcome in patients with <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the breast. METHODS: This retrospective analysis evaluated 50 patients who received diagnoses of <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1944 and 1992. Medical records were reviewed for information about the patient, the tumor, treatment, and outcome. Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and assess histologic features. RESULTS: The median tumor diameter was 1. 0 cm. Nine (20 %) of 44 axilla had histologically confirmed lymph node involvement. Lymph node involvement was neither infrequent nor predicted by features of the primary tumor. Recurrences developed in 4 patients, and 1 patient died of <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> The 5 -year disease-free survival rate was 88 %. The local therapy used, mastectomy or breast preservation, did not affect disease-free survival. Contralateral cancer was noted in 26 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Axillary metastases occur in 20 % of patients and are not predicted by features of the primary tumor. Breast preservation is a safe treatment option for <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the breast...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{association}} of <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> columnar cell lesions and lobular carcinoma in situ, {{also known as}} the “Rosen Triad”, may be encountered in breast biopsies performed for evaluation of mammographically detected microcalcifications. Case Report: A case in which <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and columnar cell hyperplasia were associated with a histologically unusual form of signet ring lobular carcinoma in situ is presented. Signet ring non-invasive lobular carcinoma is classified as high-grade lobular carcinoma in situ, but herein is associated with changes that belong to the molecular pathway of low-grade mammary neoplasia. Conclusion: We reported the case of lobular carcinoma in situ associated with columnar cell hyperplasia and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> in which the lobular carcinoma in situ was presented in a histologically unexpected form comprised predominantly of signet ring cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tubular</b> breast <b>carcinoma</b> is {{a highly}} {{differentiated}} carcinoma with an excellent prognosis. Distinct genetic alterations in <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinoma</b> cells have been described, especially broad genetic losses on the q-arm of chromosome 16. These are more common in lobular breast carcinoma and low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ than in ductal breast carcinoma and high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. To further delineate the molecular changes involved in <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinoma</b> more precisely, we examined 23 formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples (21 of <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinoma</b> and 2 of nonneoplastic breast epithelium) by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization focusing on 287 genomic target clones of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The results obtained from all nonneoplastic tissue samples of breast epithelium indicate no DNA copy number changes. In the <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinoma</b> samples, the highest frequencies for DNA sequence copy number losses were detected for CDH 13 (in 86 % of the samples) and MSH 2, KCNK 12 (in 52 % of the samples). The highest frequencies of DNA sequence copy number gains were detected for HRAS and D 13 S 319 XYZ (each in 62 % of the samples). Using principal component analysis, 3 subgroups of <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinomas</b> showing relative genetic changes were identified. For validation, the most frequent DNA copy number loss for CDH 13 (18 / 21) was confirmed using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} in 4 of 5 <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinomas</b> analyzed. The newly identified genes with considerable copy number changes may include so far unknown candidate genes for the development and progression of <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinoma,</b> such as CDH 13. The study provides the starting point for further delineating their detailed influence on the pathogenesis of <b>tubular</b> breast <b>carcinoma...</b>|$|R
40|$|Samples from medullary, intraductal, tubular and adenocystic breast carcinomas {{were studied}} ultrastructurally, with {{emphasis}} on the patterns of myoepithelial differentiation and basal lamina deposition. Myoepithelial cells, while prominent in the intraductal and adenocystic carcinomas, were rarely found in the medullary neoplasms and appeared absent in the tubular neoplasms. Parallel to the above, basal laminae were most abundant and evenly deposited in the intraductal and adenocystic tumors, but were infrequent in the medullary tumors and seemingly absent in the <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Well-defined myoepithelial cells and retention of the capability to synthesize basal lamina are evidence of differentiation in neoplastic cell populations. Thus, their presence in intraductal and adenocystic carcinomas (generally associated with a good prognosis) is not surprising. However, their scarcity or absence in the similarly favorable group of medullary and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> suggests that other factors may also influence the invasive and metastasizing ability of breast carcinomas...|$|R
5000|$|The {{prognosis}} of IDC depends, in part, on its histological subtype. Mucinous, papillary, cribriform, and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> have longer survival, {{and lower}} recurrence rates. The prognosis {{of the most}} common form of IDC, called [...] "IDC Not Otherwise Specified", is intermediate. Finally, some rare forms of breast cancer (e.g., sarcomatoid carcinoma, inflammatory carcinoma) have a poor prognosis. Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu.|$|R

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{and biological}} {{features of a}} consecutive series of impalpable invasive breast carcinoma, detected by mammography in the prevalent round of the breast screening programme, have been compared with a clinically presenting group of carcinomas in age-matched patients. There was a significantly higher prevalence of <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> as well-differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinomas in the mammographically detected group, and a lower prevalence of poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinomas. Lymph node metastasis was found in 6. 5 % of the impalpable group compared with 53 % of the clinical group. The prevalence of oestrogen receptor was much higher in the impalpable group (96 %) than {{in the control group}} (67 %), although {{there were no significant differences}} for progesterone receptor. The prevalence of pS 2 was also much higher in the impalpable group, as was cathepsin D. This finding is surprising in view of the reported relationship between cathepsin D and poorer survival. p 53 and c-erb- 2 proteins were detectable in fewer impalpable carcinomas. The mean MIBI (Ki- 67) index was lower in the impalpable group (11. 6) than in the clinical group (15. 25). Within the mammographically detected group there was a significant difference in the MIBI index between <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and the different grades of infiltrating ductal carcinomas, with a wide range in each category but no association with size. The impalpable carcinomas detected by mammography differ from clinically presenting carcinomas in many ways, raising the question of whether a proportion or all would progress (dedifferentiate) with time...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fine-needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) of both palpable and non-palpable breast carcinomas has a {{high accuracy}} and sensitivity in dedicated centres. It is generally though that low-grade carcinomas have a distinctly lower sensitivity due to a discrete cellular atypia that might be difficult to appreciate. Grade 1 carcinomas make up about 45 % of screening detected breast carcinomas and about 20 % of symptomatic breast cancers. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of G 1 carcinomas and identify the critical features in the cytological diagnostic work-up of these tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were FNAC smears from 494 histologically confirmed grade 1 carcinomas diagnosed during 1996 - 2004. The cytological diagnoses were compared with the histology. RESULTS: A definitive malignant diagnosis was given in 382 cases (77. 3 %). 16. 2 % were diagnosed as equivocal or suspicious, 4. 8 % had been given a benign or probable benign diagnosis (false negatives). 13 cases (2. 6 %) were unsatisfactory. The complete sensitivity was 92. 7 %. Invasive ductal carcinomas comprised 81. 3 % of all cases. A definite malignant preoperative diagnosis was given in 80. 8 % of these. Invasive lobular and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> comprised 7. 1 % and 5. 5 % of cases, respectively. They received a definitive, malignant preoperative diagnosis in 51. 4 % and 55. 6 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Preoperative FNAC diagnosis of grade 1 breast carcinoma {{has a high}} accuracy and sensitivity, especially in ductal carcinomas. Invasive lobular and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> receive a definite preoperative diagnosis in about 50 % of the cases. The main reason for not reaching a definitive malignant diagnosis was sampling error due to small tumours < 1 cm in diameter, irrespective of tumour subtype.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research the pathways {{of breast cancer}} development remain largely unknown. The identification of key genetic alterations, particularly at {{the early stages of}} the disease, are central to elucidating the developmental pathways for this disease. Pure populations of tumour cells were microdissected from well defined groups of breast lesions, comprising: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and mammographically-detected, impalpable early stage, moderately to well differentiated invasive carcinomas, and analysed for alterations in polymorphic tandem repetitive sequences (microsatellites). This enabled analysis of microsatellite instability (MI), which has been demonstrated to be indicative of a mutator phenotype in colorectal cancer, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which may indicate the presence of a tumour suppressor gene. MI was demonstrated to be a tumour specific alteration not present in benign proliferative disorders. It was present in 8 of 11 (73 %) high grade lesions of DCIS, but only at a low frequency in low grade DCIS and invasive carcinomas and was absent from the <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Two distinct types of alteration were observed: alterations to a single trinucleotide repeat (DM- 1), and alterations of multiple microsatellite loci. Cases demonstrating this phenotype did not show alterations of candidate DNA repair genes (MSH 2, MLH 1 and PMS 2), or in key cancer associated loci (TGFpRII, IGFIIR, Bax, and E 2 F- 4), indicating that this phenotype is distinct to that described in colorectal tumours. LOH studies were focused on chromosome 16 q 21 - 24. 4, a site for which there is evidence of alteration in {{the early stages of the}} disease. A high frequency of LOH (greater than 40 %) was observed in all carcinomas. A candidate tumour suppressor gene, E-cadherin, mapping to this region, was not found to be mutated in these cases demonstrating LOH. In vivo experiments suggested that this gene could be silenced by aberrant methylation. In summary, MI was associated with high grade lesions, whereas LOH at 16 q was observed at similar frequencies in all the carcinomas, possibly reflecting different roles in the development and progression of breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are mucin producing cystic neoplasms of {{the pancreas}} histologically classified as having non-invasive and invasive components. The five-year survival rates for non-invasive and associated invasive carcinoma are 90 % and 40 %, respectively in resected IPMN lesions. Invasive carcinoma within IPMN lesions {{can be further}} classified by histological subtype into colloid carcinoma and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Estimated five-year survival rates following resection of colloid carcinoma range from 57 %- 83 % and estimated five-year survival following resection of <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> range from 24 %- 55 %. The difference in survival outcome between invasive colloid and tubular IPMN {{appears to be a}} function of disease biology, as patients with the tubular subtype tend to have larger tumors with a propensity for metastasis to regional lymph nodes. When matched to resected conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma lesions by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center pancreatic adenocarcinoma nomogram, the colloid carcinoma histological subtype has an improved estimated five-year survival outcome compared to conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 87 % and 23 % (P = 0. 0001), respectively. Resected lesions with the <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> subtype overall have a similar five-year survival outcome compared to conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, when these groups were stratified by regional lymph node status patients with negative regional lymph nodes and the tubular subtype experienced significantly better survival than patients with a similar nodal status and ductal adenocarcinoma with estimated five-year survival rates of 73 % and 27 % (P = 0. 01), respectively...|$|E

40|$|One hundred tubular carcinomas were reviewed, {{analyzed}} and compared with previously reported {{studies in the}} literature. Our cases were subdivided into five groups, according to {{the proportion of the}} carcinoma which was tubular. In the case of pure or almost pure tubular carcinomas (76 % or more), tumor size was small, no metastases were found, no recurrences developed, and there were no deaths attributable to the carcinoma. As the proportion of the carcinoma which was tubular decreased, the size and biologic aggressiveness of the tumor increased; this it is likely that <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> may represent an early form of carcinoma. A right-sided preponderance was found of the "pure tubular" carcinomas; and lesions of the central sector of the breast were rare in all five groups. The incidence of bilateral cancer was greater than that expected for breast cancer in general and included three patients with bilateral tubular carcinomas. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that lesions which are composed 90 % or more of <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> may be treated by simple mastectomy, and that axillary dissection is not necessary. For all carcinomas with a lower proportion of tubular elements, at least total mastectomy and axillary dissection are indicated, although the safest treatment probably is radical mastectomy...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the occurrence of}} epithelial atypia in 2, 833 serially sectioned surgical breast biopsies (SB) performed for microcalcifications (median number of blocks per SB: 26) and the occurrence of subsequent cancer after an initial diagnosis of epithelial atypia (median follow-up 160  months). Epithelial atypia (flat epithelial atypia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and lobular neoplasia) were found in 971 SB, with and without a concomitant cancer in 301 (31 %) and 670 (69 %) SB, respectively. Thus, isolated epithelial atypia were found in 670 out of the 2, 833 SB (23 %). Concomitant cancers corresponded to ductal carcinomas in situ and micro-invasive (77 %), invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified (15 %), invasive lobular carcinomas (4 %), and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (4 %). Fifteen out of the 443 patients with isolated epithelial atypia developed a subsequent ipsilateral (n[*]=[*] 14) and contralateral (n[*]=[*] 1) invasive cancer. The high slide rating might explain the high percentages of epithelial atypia and concomitant cancers and the low percentage of subsequent cancer after a diagnosis of epithelial atypia as a single lesion. Epithelial atypia could be more a risk marker of concomitant than subsequent cancer...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of an immunohistological method, applied to paraffin wax sections, was assessed for determination of oestrogen receptor content of biochemically oestrogen receptor negative breast carcinomata. Sixty consecutive tumours with oestrogen receptor concentrations {{of less than}} 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein, as estimated by dextran-coated charcoal biochemical assay, were examined. Paraffin wax sections were treated with DNAse before applying a peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method using ER-ICA monoclonal antibodies. Fifty one cases (85 %) were negative, six (10 %) weakly positive, and three (5 %) were moderately positive. No strongly positive cases were seen. It is suggested that cases with weakly positive staining, especially when localised to a small area, {{should be regarded as}} negative. On the other hand, as the three moderately stained cases included two small <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and an invasive ductal carcinoma with high progesterone receptor concentrations, {{it is more likely that}} the biochemical assay in these cases represented false negative results due to sampling error or inclusion of fibrous or other non-neoplastic tissue in the assayed samples. It is concluded that the immunohistological method used here is fairly reliable and would be especially valuable for determination of oestrogen receptor content in small, mammographically detected tumours from which no tissue would be available for biochemical assay or frozen section examination...|$|R
40|$|Tumors of the mammary glands are {{the most}} common {{neoplasms}} in dogs in our country; however, there are few Brazilian reports dedicated to clinicopathological and survival studies about this disease. This report aims the clinical and pathological study of canine mammary tumors in the Santos Metropolitan Region, an area in Sao Paulo state with an estimated canine population of 120, 000 animals. Data of 14, 298 dogs were collected retrospectively from the medical records of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital of the Metropolitan University of Santos – São Paulo – Brazil. During the study period, from records of 317 females with histopathological diagnosis of neoplasia, 170 were mammary epithelial lesions distributed in 13 benign tumors, 152 malignant (89. 4 % of diagnosis) and 5 non-neoplasic epithelial lesions (ductal hyperplasia). The highest prevalent malignant tumor was <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (38. 2 % of diagnosis) and Grade I tumors, corresponding to 73. 0 % of all diagnosis. The results have shown clinical staging of canine mammary neoplasms as an important prognostic survival factor and, in a multivariate analysis, tumor diameter, tumor grade, adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence as covariates with predictive value for survival.

40|$|PURPOSE: Recently, cone-beam breast {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) is {{established for the}} breast investigation. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate possible associations between CBCT findings and histopathological features in breast cancer. METHODS: Overall, 59 female patients, mean age of 64. 6 years with histological proven breast cancer were included into the study. In all cases, non-contrast CBCT examination was done. The diagnosis of the identified lesions was confirmed histologically by biopsy. Immunohistochemical staining against estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) and Ki- 67 was performed for every lesion. Collected data were evaluated by means of descriptive statistics. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to analyze the association between CT density and Ki- 67 values. P values < 0. 05 were taken to indicate statistical significance in all instances. RESULTS: The size of the lesion varied from 2. 7 to 90. 0, mean size, 15. 88  ±  13. 0 mm. The mean value of CT density of the lesions was 63. 95  ±  38. 18 HU. The density tended to be higher in <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Correlation analysis identified no significant correlations between CT density and Ki- 67 level (r = − 0. 031, P = . 784). There were no statistically significant differences of CT density between tumors with different receptor status. CONCLUSIONS: No significant associations between CT density and receptor status in breast cancer. <b>Tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> tended to have higher CT density in comparison to other subtypes of breast carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of a monoclonal antibody to the MCF 7 breast cancer cell line were immunohistochemically studied {{on a variety}} of breast tumors, primary and metastatic, on mammary epithelium and on nonneoplastic breast lesions. A high proportion of positive reactions was observed in ductal, lobular, and <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> as well as in mammary Paget's disease. Mucinous, medullary, and papillary carcinomas showed a low incidence of reactivity. Carcinomas with metaplasia, carcinoids, and nonepithelial breast tumors were unreactive with the antibody. Positive immunostaining was documented also in nodal and extranodal metastatic lesions. The staining of nodal metastases was correlated with the positive reaction of the primary tumor. Reactivity was widely distributed in normal breast epithelial cells and in benign breast lesions. Staining of nonneoplastic mammary epithelial was associated with reactivity of adjacent neoplastic tissues. Staining differences between nonneoplastic and neoplastic mammary tissues were related to the intensity and cytologic distribution of the labeling. Heterogeneous reactivity of morphologically similar cells was documented in nonneoplastic and neoplastic breast epithelial cells as well as in nodal and extranodal breast carcinoma metastases. Immunohistologically detectable antigen was not correlated with prognostic factors such as histologic grade or nodal status. A retrospective study of T 1 NO cases failed to substantiate any prognostic value for the reactivity of primary breast tumors with this monoclonal antibody...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate as a potential prognostic indicator the relationship between histological subtype of canine mammary tumours (CMTs) and oestrogen-α (ORα) and progesterone (PR) receptor expression. Using immunohistochemistry, receptor expression in neoplastic epithelial cells was assessed in 12 different subtypes in 113 CMTs (34 benign, 79 malignant) and 101 surrounding normal tissues. Sixty-eight and 45 CMTs were from intact and ovariectomised bitches, respectively. Histological subtype strongly influenced ORα/PR expression: simple and complex adenomas as well as simple <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> exhibited the greatest expression, whereas immunohistochemical labelling for these receptors was weakest in carcinoma and malignant myoepitheliomas, as well as in solid/anaplastic carcinomas and comedocarcinomas. Receptor expression was generally higher in benign relative to malignant neoplasms, and in the latter it was significantly lower in ovariectomised vs. intact bitches. Lymphatic invasion, mitotic index, nodule diameter, and tumour grade were significantly associated with ORα/PR expression. Although not found to be an independent prognostic indicator, tumours from dogs with < 10 % cells with ORα/PR expression had a poorer prognosis. Lymphatic invasion, the state of the margins of excision, and mitotic index were found to be independent prognostic indicators. Overall, the results suggest that differences in histological subtype and whether or not a bitch has been ovariectomised should be considered when evaluating the significance of ORα and PR expression in CMTs...|$|R
40|$|Cyclin D 1 overexpression, {{detected}} by standard immunohistochemistry, {{was correlated with}} other prognostic variables and its prognostic value was evaluated {{in a group of}} 148 invasive breast cancers with long-term follow-up. Overexpression of cyclin D 1 (59 % of cases) was negatively correlated (chi 2 test) with histological grade (P = 0. 0001), mean nuclear area (P = 0. 004), mean nuclear volume (P = 0. 02), and mitotic activity (P = 0. 03) and positively correlated with estrogen receptor (P = 0. 0001). There was a strong correlation between cyclin D 1 overexpression and histological type (P = 0. 0001). Positive cyclin D 1 staining was seen in 11 of 13 <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 3 of 3 mucinous carcinomas, 4 of 4 invasive cribriform carcinomas, and 17 of 20 lobular carcinomas. Of 102 ductal cancers, 52 were positive, and all 6 medullary carcinomas were negative. There were no significant correlations with lymph node status, tumor size, or DNA ploidy. In survival analysis, cyclin D 1 overexpression did not provide significant univariate or multivariate prognostic value. In conclusion, cyclin D 1 is mainly overexpressed in the well differentiated and lobular types of invasive breast cancer and is strongly associated with estrogen receptor positivity. It is negatively correlated with the proliferation marker mitoses count and with the differentiation markers nuclear area and nuclear volume. However, cyclin D 1 overexpression {{does not seem to have}} prognostic value in invasive breast cancer when no adjuvant treatment is given...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{report the}} {{incidence}} and predictive value of positive axillary nodes in ductal {{carcinoma in situ}} (DCIS) and T 1 a carcinoma of the breast. METHODS: Cases from The Netherlands Cancer Institute {{were used to determine}} the incidence of lymph-node metastases. All consecutive patients with primary breast cancer that were treated between 1989 and 1998 and who had undergone axillary dissection were selected. Patients were identified with pure DCIS (n = 71), DCIS with small invasion (n = 12), invasive ductal/lobular carcinoma (IDC/ILC) < or = 5 mm (n = 18) or <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> < or = 10 mm (n = 17). All archived lymph nodes of these patients were re-evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: In DCIS the incidence increased from 1. 4 % with routine staining to 11 % with IHC. For DCIS with small invasion it was 0 vs 27 %, respectively. In IDC/ILC sized 2 - 5 mm the incidence rose from 6 to 12 % and in <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> < or = 10 mm from 0 to 12 %. All but one of the immunohistochemically detected metastases were isolated tumour cells (n = 9) or small (micro) metastases (n = 4). Maximally two nodes per patient were affected. None of the patients with positive lymph nodes died during follow-up (mean 102 months).

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{observed}} that screen-detected breast cancers have a better prognosis than symptomatic tumors, even after taking pathological tumor attributes into account. This {{has led to the}} hypothesis that screen-detected tumors are substantially biologically different from symptomatic cancers. METHODS: The pathology and survival by detection mode was investigated in 21, 382 breast cancers diagnosed in women aged 50 - 64 years in the West Midlands, United Kingdom, between 1988 and 2004. Tumor attributes were compared using chi-square tests and logistic regression. Survival was analyzed using Cox regression. RESULTS: Screen-detected cancers were significantly smaller, better differentiated, and less likely to be node-positive than symptomatic cancers (P <. 001 in all cases). In addition, a higher proportion of screen-detected cancers were hormone receptor-positive, and a higher proportion were <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (P <. 001). Survival was substantially better in screen-detected breast cancers (86 % at 10 yearsvs 70 % for interval cancers and 58 % for cancers in women unexposed to screening). Adjustment for age, tumor size, nodal status, grade, histological type, and year of diagnosis accounted for 64 % (interval cancers) and 68 % (unexposed women) of these survival differences, respectively. Overall survival improved with time. Approximately half of this improvement was due to the increase over time in the proportion of tumors that were screen-detected. CONCLUSION: The majority of the difference in prognosis between screen-detected and symptomatic breast cancers is due to the differences in routinely measured pathological features (size, type, grade, and nodal status), leaving a small residual difference to be accounted for by other biological differences...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chlorothalonil {{is a broad}} spectrum, non-systemic {{fungicide}} {{widely used}} to control diseases affecting over 50 fruit, vegetable, and agricultural crops. Despite its extensive use for over 30 years, {{little is known about}} the potential human carcinogenicity associated with the routine application of chlorothalonil. Rodent studies have shown evidence of renal <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and adenomas. We explored cancer incidence with chlorothalonil exposure using data from the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Methods: Licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators were recruited into this study from 1993 to 1997. Detailed information regarding pesticide use was obtained via self-administered questionnaires. Cancer incidence was followed through December 31, 2004. Chlorothalonil exposure was classified by lifetime exposure days and intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days, and then categorized into tertiles. The intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days metric was calculated based on a complex algorithm which includes pesticide application methods among other factors. This may increase or decrease exposure. Results: Of the 47, 625 pesticide applicators included in this analysis, 3657 applicators reported using chlorothalonil with a median of 3. 5 application days per year. Chlorothalonil was not associated with overall cancer incidence, nor did we find any association with colon, lung, and prostate cancers—the only cancers for which we had sufficient numbers to explore associations. Conclusion: We did not find any strong evidence for an association between chlorothalonil and the cancers investigated. Although animal studies have suggested renal cancer may be associated with chlorothalonil, we had insufficient data to evaluate this cancer...|$|R
30|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{of breast cancer}} was confirmed by histology in all cases. Tumors had been diagnosed by experienced pathologists using standard criteria for histology and grading. All patients had resectable stage 0 –III tumors according to the TNM 6.0 staging (Union International Cancer Congress, TisN 0 M 0 -T 2 N 3 M 0). The histological diagnosis was mainly invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) 1, 042 (75.45 %), IDC in situ (DCIS) 84 (6.08 %), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) 140 (10.14 %) and others 115 (8.33 %) (including metaplastic, adenoid, papillary, apocrine, cribriform, medullary, mucinous and <b>tubular</b> invasive <b>carcinomas).</b> Patients were diagnosed mainly with IDC (1, 042 cases) therefore {{statistical analysis was performed}} within this subgroup.|$|R
40|$|Phyllodes {{tumors are}} an {{infrequent}} breast tumor presentation. A phyllodes tumor with a synchronous {{invasive ductal carcinoma}} is rarely described {{and has never been}} reported with lobular carcinoma in situ component. A 53 -year-old female presented with a nine-year history of twice core biopsy proven fibroadenoma. After an increase in the tumor’s growth velocity it was decided upon to undergo an excisional biopsy. Microscopic examination of the well-circumscribed pale-tan mass found focal areas of leaf like architecture with variable number of mitoses present, representing a phyllodes tumor of borderline malignant potential. Incidentally, at one edge of the mass was found a <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and lobular carcinoma in situ components. Thorough, routine follow-up of patients with biopsy proven benign breast masses is important to finding a masked malignant component...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the utility of}} scintimammography using a standard -camera and a dedicated breast camera as an adju-vant to mammography and clinical examination. Methods: The study population comprised 37 patients with dense breasts and a family or personal history of breast cancer. The subjects had no suggestive clinical or mammographic findings. After intrave-nous administration of 99 mTc-sestamibi, the patients were im-aged using a conventional -camera and a dedicated breast camera that allowed breast compression during image acquisi-tion. Images were interpreted independently by 2 reviewers. All patients with positive scintimammography findings underwent biopsy. Results: Dedicated breast camera results were positive in 13. 5 % (5 / 37) of patients. Biopsy of these 5 patients yielded 3 carcinomas: an infiltrating lobular carcinoma, a ductal carci-noma in situ, and an infiltrating <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> These...|$|E
40|$|Histopathological {{manifestation of}} breast cancer tissue were divided into 4 types {{concerning}} to biological malignancies; macro-expansive, micro-extensive, with continuity and without continuity. In this regards, 150 cases {{of breast cancer}} patients were studied on invasions to duct, lymph vessel, fatty tissue, and skin relation to T, Stage, histology, and histopathological manifestation. Most of cases were macroexpansive without continuity type in dominant foci, and microextensive without continuity type in predominant parts. Invasion to lymph vessel was high average but no relationship with T and Stage, and invasion to fatty tissue and skin was increased with T and Stage. In scirrhous carcinoma the infiltration and invasion was observed. Infiltration and invasion was week in continuity type and high in without continuity type. Many of predominant parts in papillotubular carcinoma was macroexpansive without continuity type, and that of medullary <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> was microextensive without continuity type...|$|E
40|$|Sialyl Lewis x–modified core 2 {{branched}} O-glycans (C 2 -O-sLex) {{on human}} leukocytes mediate much higher-affinity adhesion to selectins on activated vascular endothelium than does sialyl Lewis x on other structures. In some canine and human carcinomas, high expression of sLex-decorated carbohydrates {{has been associated}} with metastasis and, in humans, a poor prognosis, but detection in canine gastric carcinomas is unreported. The authors hypothesized that these carbohydrates are highly expressed in more malignant types of canine gastric carcinomas, they promote metastasis, and they are associated with a poorer prognosis for dogs. The objectives were to determine the presence and importance of C 2 -O-sLex expression in canine gastric carcinomas. Routine histological sections of 16 canine gastric carcinomas were categorized on the basis of 3 classification schemes: World Health Organization, Lauren, and Goseki. Serial sections were stained with antibodies directed against C 2 -O-sLex (CHO- 131 monoclonal antibody), cytokeratin (Lu- 5 monoclonal antibody), and stains to detect neutral and acid mucins (periodic acid–Schiff and alcian blue). Whereas normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells were negative for C 2 -O-sLex, 56 % of the tumors examined were positive for C 2 -O-sLex. Importantly, the majority of more poorly differentiated tumor types had more numerous and larger inten-sely stained areas of C 2 -O-sLex expression compared with moderate to well-differentiated tumor types. Signet ring–type carci-nomas had markedly higher distribution and intensity of periodic acid–Schiff and alcian blue staining than did <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> These findings suggest that C 2 -O-sLex is a tumor-associated antigen that {{may play a role in}} the invasiveness and metastatic poten-tial of certain types of canine gastric carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research, {{the pathways}} {{of breast cancer}} development remain largely unknown. Identification of key genetic alterations, particularly at {{early stages of the}} disease, are central to elucidating the development of the disease.;Analyses for abnormal forms of the oestrogen receptor (ER) were performed to determine if they may be functionally important in the evolution of breast cancer. Forty four mammographically detected, node negative, 15 mm of less, moderately or well differentiated, invasive carcinomas were screened b RT-PCR and single stranded conformational Polymorphism analysis, identifying variant forms of exon 3, 5 and 7 in addition to 3 missense mutations. ER splice variants were detected in 15 / 44 tumours and included exon 5 (2 / 44), exon 3 (4 / 44) and exon 7 (13 / 44). 10 / 37 grade I and II tumours had variants compared with 5 / 7 grade III tumours. In addition, 11 / 39 ER+ and either progesterone (PgR) + or PgR- tumours had variants compared with 4 / 5 ER-/PgR-tumours.;Pure populations of tumour cells were microdissected from well defined groups of breast lesions including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIA), <b>tubular</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and a similar tumour group screened for variant ERs, and analysed for alterations to polymorphic microsatellite sequences within, and flanking the ER gene (6 q 25. 1 - 27) itself. This enabled evaluation of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) indicating the presence of tumour suppressor genes, and microsatellite instability (MI) indicative of a mutator phenotype in colorectal cancers.;Frequent LOH, apart from the M 6 P/IGF 2 R locus, was observed for all types and grades of disease studied; identifying loss in this region as an early event involved in breast development/progression. In comparison, MI at multiple loci and LOH at the M 6 P/IGF 2 R were only found in high grade DCIS. LOH at this chromosomal interval in all types and grade of disease suggests inactivation of other as of yet uncharacterised tumour suppressor genes mapped on chromosome 6 q 25. 1 - 27...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a {{heterogeneous}} disease, though {{little is known about}} some of its rarer forms, including certain histologic types. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data on 135 [*] 157 invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed from 1992 to 2001, relationships between nine histologic types of breast cancer and various tumour characteristics were assessed. Among women aged 50 – 89 years at diagnosis, lobular and ductal/lobular carcinoma cases {{were more likely to be}} diagnosed with stage III/IV, ⩾ 5. 0 [*]cm, and node-positive tumours compared to ductal carcinoma cases. Mucinous, comedo, <b>tubular,</b> and medullary <b>carcinomas</b> were less likely to present at an advanced stage. Lobular, ductal/lobular, mucinous, <b>tubular,</b> and papillary <b>carcinomas</b> were less likely, and comedo, medullary, and inflammatory carcinomas were more likely to be oestrogen receptor (ER) negative/progesterone receptor (PR) negative and high grade (notably, 68. 2 % of medullary carcinomas were ER−/PR− vs 19. 3 % of ductal carcinomas). In general, similar differences were observed among women diagnosed at age 30 – 49 years. Inflammatory carcinomas are associated with more aggressive tumour phenotypes, and mucinous, tubular, and papillary tumours are associated with less aggressive phenotypes. The histologic types of breast cancer studied here differ greatly in their clinical presentations, and the differences in their hormone receptor profiles and grades point to their likely different aetiologies...|$|R
