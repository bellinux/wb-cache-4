5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 {{miles to the east}} in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

50|$|Some {{witnesses}} describe <b>the</b> <b>light</b> as {{appearing to}} approach them {{several times before}} retreating. Others report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were able {{to keep pace with}} them when they were in a moving motor vehicle.|$|R
5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn darkness, {{was the first}} American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the program would not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. The crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision, but in practice it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of the solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E

5|$|She left Soda Creek for {{her first}} trip {{upstream}} on May 23, leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am. Captain Browne made semi-weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for testing in the two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon, offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam capstan. However, Browne soon realized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and powerful BX {{did not need to}} line through and could run the canyons unaided. By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be picked up on the other side. However, by the fall of 1910, the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her passengers on board. This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals, all of which had to line through both canyons, wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary crater clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central crater cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a downrange ejecta blanket, or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage {{of this is that}} when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E

25|$|The {{waveguide}} {{analysis shows}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> {{energy in the}} fiber is not completely confined in the core. Instead, especially in single-mode fibers, a significant fraction of the energy in the bound mode travels in the cladding as an evanescent wave.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, neither v nor D in {{the formula}} are {{directly}} observable, {{because they are}} properties now of a galaxy, whereas our observations refer to the galaxy in the past, at the time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> we currently see left it.|$|E
50|$|A second {{hypothesis}} is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> are <b>the</b> result of known geophysical phenomena, such as piezoelectrics or marsh gas. Though {{in many cases}} lights are reported from areas without favourable geological conditions.|$|R

25|$|Shortly after release, some users {{complained about}} the {{lighting}} implementation on the Kindle Paperwhite. While not widespread, some users found the lighting to be inconsistent, causing the bottom edge to cast irregular shadows.

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{incandescent}} lamps, some color changes occur as a lamp is dimmed, allowing for {{a limited amount of}} color control through a dimmer. Fades (brightness transitions) can be either UP or DOWN, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> output is increasing or decreasing during the transition. Most modern dimmers are solid state, though many mechanical dimmers are still in operation.|$|E

5000|$|WITI {{was looking}} for a way to make the tower a Milwaukee landmark, and in October 1963, the station {{received}} permission from the Shorewood village board to install lights on it. Shortly thereafter, approximately 2000 25 watt lights were installed. Station manager Roger LeGrand then coined the phrase [...] "Milwaukee's Tower of Light". Some neighbors objected. The Shorewood village attorney opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> [...] "6" [...] sign might violate <b>the</b> village's <b>lighted</b> sign ordinance, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> affixed to <b>the</b> tower's legs were legal. The village later declared <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> and <b>the</b> sign to be legal. Except for special requests - such as to aid navigation on Lake Michigan during sailing races - the tower was only lit from dusk until midnight.|$|R

25|$|The hyperluminous quasar APM 08279+5255 was, when {{discovered}} in 1998, given an absolute magnitude of −32.2. High resolution imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope and the 10m Keck Telescope revealed that {{this system is}} gravitationally lensed. A study of the gravitational lensing of this system suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> emitted has been magnified {{by a factor of}} ~10. It is still substantially more luminous than nearby quasars such as 3C273.|$|E
25|$|After {{working in}} Switzerland on 9 and 10 March and {{recording}} a television special for the BBC on Saturday, 11 March 1978, François {{returned to his}} Paris apartment, 46 Boulevard Exelmans, to appear, the next day, on Les Rendez-vous du Dimanche with TV host Michel Drucker.

25|$|Placing {{the flash}} {{away from the}} camera's optical axis ensures <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from the flash hits the eye at an oblique angle. The light enters the eye in a {{direction}} away from the optical axis of the camera and is refocused by the eye lens back along the same axis. Because of this the retina will not be visible to the camera and the eyes will appear natural.|$|E

50|$|When either type {{of system}} is activated, a 15-minute {{countdown}} starts, after which <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> turn off. While <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> are on, whenever a lighting command is issued, whether it changes <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> intensity or not, the fifteen-minute countdown is reset.
