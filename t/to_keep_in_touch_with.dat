5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them {{a slice of the}} lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do something other than a simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} was mobilised in August 1914 in the 1st South Western Mounted Brigade, but did {{not proceed}} to France until December 1915. In May 1916, two squadrons joined the XV Corps cavalry unit, with two further squadrons joining IX Corps Cavalry regiment. During 1916–17, duties mainly involved policing, traffic control, despatch riding and similar activities. In March 1917, the regiment played its only part in the War as horsed cavalry, during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. Over an eleven-day period, German forces retreated 20–25 miles to prepared positions. The RWY formed part of the advanced guard of the British Army, attempting <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the German rearguards, but this was difficult owing to the broken {{nature of the ground}} behind the original German lines. Contact was made several times with Uhlans and a lance captured in one of these engagements is still in possession of the regiment.|$|E

25|$|The {{mission of}} the 1st Aero Squadron during the Punitive Expedition was {{primarily}} one of communications and observation, and during {{the first phase of}} the Punitive Expedition the 1st Aero Squadron was of considerable help in enabling Pershing <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his thinly spread, fast-moving troopers. The squadron also performed several reconnaissance missions, and although these failed to locate enemy forces, that information in itself was important for the commander to know. The second phase of the Punitive Expedition was probably most important for the squadron, because the officers and men gained experience and knowledge by experimenting with a variety of airplanes and aviation equipment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Courtneidge {{appeared}} in a succession of plays in London and the provinces, including The Bride Comes Back, and also in pantomime and a re-creation of old music hall (Fielding's Music Hall, 1964). In 1962, she gave what she considered her finest film performance, in a role wholly unlike her usual parts; in The L-Shaped Room she played an elderly lesbian, living in a drab London flat with her cat, recalling her career as an actress and forlornly trying <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> former friends. The Times described her performance as a triumph. In 1962 and 1963, she and Hulbert starred alongside Vic Oliver, in the BBC radio sitcom, Discord in Three Flats (1962).|$|E

25|$|On 13 September, {{the main}} {{campaign}} opened. The King, to find recruits among his sympathisers and {{arms in the}} armouries of the Derbyshire and Staffordshire, trained bands and also <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his disciplined regiments in Ireland by way of Chester, moved westward to Shrewsbury. Essex followed suit by marching his army from Northampton to Worcester. Near here, a sharp cavalry engagement, Powick Bridge, took place on 23 September between the advanced cavalry of Essex's army, and a force under Prince Rupert, which was engaged in protecting the retreat of the Oxford detachment. The result of the fight was the immediate overthrow of the Parliamentary cavalry. This gave the Royalist troopers confidence in themselves and in their brilliant leader, which was not shaken until they met Oliver Cromwell's Ironsides.|$|E
25|$|Brigadiers {{should move}} with the advance and divisional commanders should create {{reserves}} by reorganizing their brigades. Headquarters should be placed where attacks could be seen, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> events when communications broke down, a chronic problem which was increased by distance from the front line. Telephone links in the rear were far easier to maintain but became less important once the infantry battle began. Corps headquarters also {{had the benefit of}} air observation and less need of direct communication with troops on the battlefield, since their main role was counter-battery artillery-fire, which was independent of the infantry battle. The attack was to be maintained by the use of reserves moving towards objectives laid down before the attack, so as to make them independent of messages from the front line, which were often delayed and out of date if they arrived.|$|E

25|$|In Australia and New Zealand, netball {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular sports played by women. Women's sport in Oceania has {{traditionally}} had a very low profile. Despite this, netball is popular in Oceania, with its growth partly because of New Zealand encouraging the game and providing money for the training of coaches, umpires and other netball development needs. Netball {{is one of the}} sports at the Pacific Games, a multi-sport event, with participation from countries around the South Pacific, that is held every four years. The popularity of netball is growing amongst men on the island countries in Oceania, because sport is an important way for villages <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> each other. The game's popularity can also be seen in local languages, where local words have been created to describe it.

25|$|Pétain and Haig met at Dury at 4pm on 23 March, Petain {{stressing}} {{the need for}} Gough’s Fifth Army <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Pellé’s French V Corps on its right. Petain agreed to place a group of two French armies under Fayolle as a reserve in the Somme valley, south of Fifth Army, but could not agree to Haig’s request to send 20 French divisions to Amiens {{because of the risk}} of a German attack in Champagne. Haig’s diary at this point stresses the importance of maintaining contact with Petain, even at the cost of abandoning the “northern flank”. Amidst mutual suspicion – a French officer recorded Petain’s increasing fears on 22 and 23 March that the British would retreat on the Channel Ports - Petain was issuing orders to cover Paris as a priority and maintain contact with the British “if possible”.|$|E
25|$|De Keyser's {{career was}} not limited to Amsterdam, and his {{international}} contacts helped him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the mainstream of European architecture. The Amsterdam city administrators sent him to England where he worked with Inigo Jones (1573-1652). Jones was the first English architect who went to Italy to learn all he could about classical architecture. He studied the famous treatises written by the Roman architect Vitruvius (circa 30 BC), and his intimate knowledge of the work of Palladio (1518-1580) gave him the nickname the English Palladio. The Banqueting House in London, designed for the Stuart monarchs, became the prototype of classical architecture in England. When De Keyser returned to Amsterdam one of Jones’ assistants, Nicholas Stone, joined him. Stone worked with De Keyser in Amsterdam from 1607 to 1613 and even became his son-in-law. De Keyser attention to England and English architecture reflect Amsterdam's position as a commercial centre in Europe.|$|E
