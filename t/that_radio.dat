5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and <b>that</b> <b>radio</b> communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} led {{to major}} changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and <b>that</b> <b>radio</b> equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock. An International Ice Patrol {{was set up to}} monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of Zeppelin {{commenced}} on 8 February, with threats to Greece and Crete. A provisional date for the supposed invasion was set at 29 March (to {{take advantage of the}} full moon). On 10 March the operation moved to a second stage, where the fictional operation was delayed until April and May to join up with a supposed Soviet invasion of Bulgaria. Stage two was communicated through a sub-plan called Dungloe, involving double agents back in England. The story passed to the Germans was <b>that</b> <b>radio</b> messages would inform friendly leaders in Yugoslavia of the intended invasion dates and any delays.|$|E

5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their crews {{were in a}} state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given <b>that</b> <b>radio</b> operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E

50|$|Systems such as frequency-hopping spread {{spectrum}} (FHSS) used by Futaba employ frequency hopping on the 2.4 GHz band {{instead of the}} various frequencies in the lower MHz ranges. The advantage is <b>that</b> <b>radios</b> are no longer using a fixed frequency during flight, mitigating the risk of interference on that fixed frequency.|$|R

25|$|The main {{generating}} plant {{was inside the}} hull and consisted of two fuel-burning generators. Two small ram air turbines attached to the main gondola on swinging arms supplemented electrical power for the radio room, internal lighting, the galley, and acted as a reserve. Batteries stored the electrical energy so <b>that</b> <b>radio</b> operation was independent of airspeed. The gondola also had a gasoline generator for emergency power.|$|E

25|$|A 1927 Royal Commission into {{wireless}} broadcasting recommended <b>that</b> <b>radio</b> {{licence fees}} be pooled to fund larger A-Class stations. The government established the National Broadcasting Service {{to take over}} the 12 A-Class licences as they came up for renewal from 1928. The original legislation permitted advertising, but this was removed from the Act before it came into effect. At the same time, the government created the Australian Broadcasting Company to supply programs to the new national broadcaster.|$|E
25|$|Even {{from the}} {{earliest}} reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an over-the-horizon radar, and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the Cold War. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to submarine communications. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed <b>that</b> <b>Radio</b> Moscow and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.|$|E

25|$|It {{could be}} argued <b>that</b> <b>radio</b> was born in Cornwall. In 1901 at Poldhu on The Lizard, Guglielmo Marconi made his first trans-atlantic radio transmission. It would be another twenty six years before the BBC National Programme was audible in Cornwall, from the then new long wave {{transmitter}} at Daventry, although BBC transmissions began in 1922. The transmission, coming {{a long way from}} Cornwall, (from the centre of the English Midlands), was crackly and barely audible at night-time, and it was a solitary listening experience, as sets were only equipped with a single earpiece, and not a loudspeaker.|$|E
