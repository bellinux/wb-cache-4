The resulting DPJ presidential election was held on 25 December 2012, which was contested by Kaieda and Sumio Mabuchi. It was eventually won by Kaieda with 90 votes to Mabuchi's 54 votes. It was suggested that his rise to the leadership could lead to cooperation with Ozawa, who had left the DPJ during 2012 due to Noda's pushing through of a consumption tax increase.|$|E

It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Army's officer-to-soldier {{ratio was}} {{extremely}} top-heavy, partially {{in order to}} compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following WorldWarII and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the soldiers' welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above). Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked round the clock, normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale amongst young officers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{reflection on}} the journey of completing a PhD by using emergent themes that occurred in supervision sessions as recorded in a reflective journal. The paper highlights the need <b>to</b> reflect and <b>accept</b> decisions that can be challenging. The paper also indicates examples where past understandings are questioned and newer insights have to be explored. A conclusion related <b>to</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> what happens {{as a consequence of}} supervision sessions is debated. Finally a new insight into identity is arrived at...|$|R

25|$|The {{conclusion}} contained many factual errors: eating {{fish and}} shellfish from {{other areas of the}} Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky {{explains}} {{his decision to}} focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway {{the population of the}} U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.|$|E
25|$|On many occasions, Doom’s {{only real}} {{weakness}} {{has been his}} arrogance. Layla Miller once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be {{the reason for his}} failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom’s continued refusal <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the accident that fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is generally unable to accept when others may {{have a better understanding of}} a situation than he does – with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as Mister Fantastic or the Thing when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain. For instance, while allied with Adam Warlock and other heroes against the Titan Thanos, he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated.|$|E

[...] The example stated {{is the use of}} passive speech by [...] "those who refuse <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> their acts".

[...] While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. [...] Wolters questioned Speer's readiness <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.|$|E

500|$|Washington {{also claimed}} that American University cut off {{contact with him}} after he punched Tomjanovich. However, {{this appears to be}} a {{misrepresentation}} of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: [...] "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant." [...] John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> his actions in that fight.

500|$|Propeller {{shaft seals}} were a {{significant}} problem on Collins and Farncomb. Although designed {{to allow for a}} leak of [...] per hour, during trials {{it was found that the}} seals would regularly misalign and allow hundreds of litres per hour into the boat—during one deep diving test the flow rate was measured at approximately [...] a minute. ASC claimed that solving these problems could be done by manually adjusting the seals as the submarine dived and rose, but this would have required a sailor dedicated solely to that task, affecting efforts to minimise the required number of personnel. It was found that the problem could be temporarily alleviated by running the propeller in reverse for 100revolutions, pulling the seal back into alignment, although a permanent solution could initially not be found, as ASC refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the problem, and the original manufacturer of the seals had closed down. New suppliers were found, with modified seals fitted to the first two submarines in late 1996, before completely re-designed seals were fitted to the boats in late 1997, solving the problem.|$|E

500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} censorship. It uses the {{execution}} of Terrance and Phillip as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse. Cartman's use of foul language helps to avert the disaster. Parents and [...] "lazy child rearing" [...] come in for particularly sharp criticism. On their way to see Terrance and Phillip, the boys sing that [...] "movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!" [...] During [...] "Blame Canada" [...] a couple are seen abandoning their baby in their enthusiasm to join Mothers Against Canada. The song ends with: [...] "We must blame them and cause a fuss / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!" [...] Much of the film's satire and many of the songs are concerned with the refusal of people <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> failure and their tendency to look for scapegoats (some of the songs are also parodies of musical theatre, but this is usually secondary to furthering the satire). Movies, government, society, foreigners and Satan are all blamed, leading Kyle to remark: [...] "whenever I get in trouble, you go off and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame. Deal with me." [...] The movie is also self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrance and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie.|$|E
500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{praised the}} episode for its {{effectiveness}} in scenes featuring little dialogue, particularly with Jesse and Gus, claiming, [...] "No show does silence like Breaking Bad." [...] He also complimented Cranston's desperate monologue {{while trying to}} convince Gus not to kill him, claiming it provided a deep insight into Walt's character and his inability <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> his actions. Zap2it writer Rick Porter called the scene with Gus killing Victor a [...] "master class in building tension" [...] due to the strong writing, direction and acting, particularly by Esposito. Scott Wampler of Collider.com called it [...] "a fantastic, bloody, shocking season premiere, {{one of the best}} in the show's history". He particularly praised Esposito's performance and suggested it could make the actor worthy of contention for an Emmy Award. BlackBook magazine writer Chris Mohney strongly praised Esposito's performance, and described his silence and calm during the climactic scene as [...] "one of the great recent moments of TV menace". June Thomas of Slate magazine called it a [...] "fine opening episode" [...] that did not advance the plot significantly but [...] "served as an artful reminder of where the characters stand psychologically". Thomas said she believed the episode demonstrated that Walter is in fact a weak man, comparing his useless pleas to Gus to his ineffective attempts to mislead Skyler about his drug-manufacturing activities in earlier seasons. Not all reviews were positive. Jessica Grose, also of Slate magazine, said while she prefers episodes that mixed its darker aspects with black humor, [...] "Box Cutter" [...] was [...] "all claustrophobia and fear". The Philadelphia Inquirer columnist David Hiltbrand condemned the violent scene with Victor's death, which he called [...] "totally gratuitous ... serv no plot or character purpose".|$|E

It is an information seeking activity enabled by electronic health records. This paper reports on a qualitative study of chart biopsies conducted by General Medicine physicians in a large quaternary teaching hospital prior to discussing possible admissions of patients from the Emergency Department (ED). The paper makes three contributions. First, this research provides an account of an information practice not previously documented and characterizes that practice as a social constructionist activity. Second, the study demonstrates that new information technologies can enable new information practices which in turn can alter the balance of participation in organizational coordination efforts. Third, the study shows that the understandings constructed from information seeking can have consequences for organizational orders. ...|$|R
