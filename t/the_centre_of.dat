5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> pressure shifts rearwards.

The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
