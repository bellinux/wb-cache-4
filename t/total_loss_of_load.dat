40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{mechanical}} properties {{of a new}} class of multifunctional architectured materials, Topologically Interlocking Materials (TIMs). These materials are created as an assembly of unit elements arranged in an interlocking pattern such that the load transfer between unit elements occurs by contact only. In the absence of adhesive interaction, the tensile component of the load is carried by complementary tensile elements in the form of external constraints or integrated filaments. By virtue of the bottom up design used in creating these materials, their mechanical properties are influenced by a number of controllable parameters including shape, confinement force, scale, and, composition. The overall hypothesis is that these parameters can be advantageously exploited to create a family of materials that fill empty holes in the material property space. The contributions of this research can be classified into two main tasks: (1) Experimental exploration of novel TIM designs, and, (2) The development of mechanics models that explain the deformation and failure of these materials, and hence provide rules for designing these materials for specific functional requirements. ^ We hypothesize that TIM assemblies made of cellular unit elements would result in a range of properties obtained from TIM assemblies, traditionally created using dense unit elements. Drop tower experiments were performed to characterize the physical properties of TIM assemblies made of different relative densities. The analysis of the experiments revealed that stiffness, strength and toughness decreased linearly with relative density. An analytical model based on the concept of thrust line analysis was developed for the prediction of the observed material behavior. Model predictions were in agreement with experimental data. ^ We recognize that TIM assemblies are 2 D ordered granular crystals and hence provide the ability of active control of mechanical properties under the influence of varying confinement force. By varying the in-plane force, active control of TIM stiffness and energy absorption was demonstrated, with specific application towards creating an adaptive energy absorbing material. The previously developed analytical model was modified by incorporating the ability to actively control the in-plane force leading to active control of out-of-plane response. Model was able to reproduce experimentally observed results and was proposed as a means to creating an algorithm for a smart system design using TIM assemblies. ^ The thesis subsequently explores the scaling power laws for stiffness, strength and toughness. Even though the contact dominated mechanics of TIM assemblies is far different from the bending dominated mechanics of monolithic plates, stiffness of the 2 D TIM assemblies was found to scale similar to the rectangular plates, albeit with lower magnitudes. The strength and toughness scaling laws were then predicted by using a linearized model. Toughness was seen to vary positively with both, strength and stiffness, in contrast to the inverse relationship usually obtained for the engineering materials. These scaling relationships were used to demonstrate design of materials with specific desired mechanical properties. ^ Finally, a novel bioinspired design was proposed by combining the concept of tensegrity, observed in biological structures, and, topological interlocking. The design proposed embedding the interlocked assembly in a woven net of fiber tows. These fiber tows now held the unit elements together replacing the previously used rigid frame. The structure showed an initial nonlinear hardening response until the first failure event followed by regaining of strength before <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> carrying capacity. A previously established analytical model was used to explain the experimental observations. The model was extended to propose a material with variable stiffness response, obtained by controlling the stiffness of the fibers in the fiber tow. ...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{islanding}} is {{the last}} countermeasure for a bulk power system when it suffers from severe cascading contingencies. The objective of controlled islanding is to maintain the stability of each island {{and to keep the}} <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> the whole system to a minimum. This paper presents a novel integrated wide-area measurement systems (WAMS) -based adaptive controlled islanding strategy, which depends on the dynamic post-fault trajectories under different failure modes. We first utilize an improved Laplacian eigenmap algorithm (ILEA) to identify the coherent generators and use the slow coherency grouping algorithm to guarantee coherent stability within an island. Using the identification result, we then define the minimum coherent generator virtual nodes to reduce the searching space in a graph and utilize the k-way partitioning (KWP) algorithm to obtain a preliminary partition of the simplified graph. Based on the preliminary partition, we consider the direction of power flow and propose a variable neighborhood heuristic searching algorithm to search the optimal separation surfaces so that the net imbalanced power of islands is minimized. Finally, the bidirectional power flow tracing algorithm and PQ decomposition power flow analysis are utilized to determine the corrective controls within each island. The test results with the New England 39 -bus system and the IEEE 118 -bus system show that the proposed integrated controlled islanding strategy can automatically adapt to different fault modes through generator coherency identification and effectively group the different coherent generators into different islands...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} the progressive collapse behaviour of building structures is the response of axially restrained beams following partial or <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> bearing capacity <b>of</b> a supporting member. Owing to the various complex effects involved such as material and geometric nonlinearity, advanced numerical approaches {{tend to be the}} most effective tools for modelling performance. Such approaches, however, lack the simplicity needed for common use and may provide only limited capability for understanding structural behaviour. For such purposes, more limited analysis approaches that can address adequately the basic features of performance {{are likely to be more}} productive. One such method for modelling the response of axially restrained steel and composite beams following column loss is presented in this paper. The method involves explicit modelling of the connection behaviour and employs conventional structural analysis principles to describe beam performance using accessible spreadsheet calculations. Following careful verification against detailed numerical analyses and validation against available experimental results, the proposed method is deemed capable of modelling the various complex features of response with excellent accuracy. Therefore, it may form a promising advance in studying and understanding the basic mechanics of the problem...|$|R

40|$|Slung load {{operation}} offers {{wide spectrum}} of scenarios, ranging from simple transport of bulky goods to rescue of people in mountains or from ships in distress. Some <b>of</b> the external <b>loads</b> are simple bluff bodies, others have an aerodynamically sensitive shape. The transport <b>of</b> external <b>load</b> requires intensive training and exercising of the pilots. The problem {{is the lack of}} appropriate cues and situation awareness if the load starts oscillating. Swinging helicopter external slung loads often lead to dangerous situations which not only can result in a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> itself but also can endanger the helicopter and its crew. Therefore, DLR and its partner iMAR have developed a Flight Director to assist the pilot during slung load transport. The flight director aims at providing the pilot with a convenient aid he intuitively can use to effectively damp the load pendulum motion and to allow manoeuvring without exciting oscillatory load modes. The development of a demonstrator system for the DLR BO 105 helicopter is outlined. Flight test results using a stable as well as a marginally stable load are shown. Based on the good experience gathered with the demonstrator system, a 2 nd generation flight director has been developed for the large cargo helicopter CH 53 G. The design and development of this improved flight director system is described in detail. In addition, corresponding flight test results are presented. The paper clearly shows the capability of the flight director to assist the pilot in damping swinging loads very quickly. In addition, it is shown, that the flight director is also capable in expanding the flight envelope for slung load transport. Pilots rated the flight director not only to reduce workload, but also to improve situation awareness. ...|$|R

In this study, the biomass residue effects on infiltration, runoff, and export of total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), sediment-associated carbon (TSS-C), and other undesirable constituents such as phosphate (soluble P), nitrate (), and ammonium () in runoff water from a furrow-irrigated field were studied. Furrow irrigation experiments were conducted in 91 and 274 [*]m long fields, in which the amount of residue in the furrows varied among four treatments. The biomass residue in the furrows increased infiltration, and this affected total <b>load</b> <b>of</b> DOC, TSS, and TSS-C.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) such as toluene, chlorobenzene, 1, 2 -dichloroethane and methyl-tert-buthyl-ether are {{commonly found in}} natural and drinking water. When these compounds are dissolved in groundwater are considered dangerous {{for the health of}} human and ecosystems already at low concentration [1]. For this reason, the removal of this organics from natural water is of considerable interest. Actually, a reliable alternative to obtain this goal is based on the adsorption technique by means of high-silica zeolites. The efficiency of the hydrophobic zeolites adsorption, from aqueous solution, has been highlighted in recent studies and its success is due to both selectivity and flexibility of the framework of these materials [2 - 4]. Moreover, the process does not induce the formation of dangerous secondary molecules for the environment. On the basis of as reported, in this work the interaction and mobility of some VOCs pollutants have been studied. Those VOCs have characterized by different chemical properties and molecular dimensions, and they are adsorbed in organophilic synthetic zeolites (ZSM- 5 and Y with MFI and FAU topology, respectively) which differ in topology, channel systems and free window apertures. Furthermore, it has been checked the efficiently of these materials paying attention on the pollutants adsorption in presence of common competitors, such as humic monomers (e. g. caffeic acid and para-hydroxybenzaldheyde), by monitoring the structural features. Indeed, the presence of organic matter could influence the process of adsorption of pollutants in the waters competing for the available adsorption sites, either by limiting access to the micro-pores. The selected organophilic and hydrophobic zeolites were commercial as-synthesized with high SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (up to 200). Kinetics and adsorption isotherm batch data were obtained via Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction-GC. After pollutants adsorption the structural characterization was obtain by using X-ray powders diffraction data collected on a Bruker D 8 Advance diffractometer equipped with SOL-X detector. To determinate the <b>total</b> weight <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> zeolites <b>loaded</b> with fuel-based compounds thermal analyses (TG and DTA) were performed in air up to 900 °C at 10 °C/min. This combined study allowed us to: a) measure the sorption capacity of hydrophobic zeolite materials weighed against organic pollutants dissolved in water; b) characterise the structure after contaminants adsorption; c) localise the organic species in the zeolite channel systems; d) highlight the role of humic monomers in the pollutants removal; e) probe the interaction between the adsorbate and the zeolite framework.

Following a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all heat sinks, the degasser/condenser relief valves (DCRV) become the sole means available for the depressurization of the primary heat transport system. If {{a nuclear power plant}} has a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> heat sinks accident, high-temperature steam and differential pressure between the primary heat transport system (PHTS) and the steam generator (SG) secondary side can cause a SG tube creep rupture. To protect the PHTS during a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all heat sinks accident, a sufficient depressurization capability of the degasser/condenser relief valve and the SG tube integrity is very important. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the discharge through these valves is necessary {{to assess the impact of}} the PHTS overprotection and the SG tube integrity of the primary circuit. This paper describes the analysis of DCRV discharge capacity and the SG tube integrity under a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all heat sink using the CATHENA code.

The risk indices evaluated in the paper includes mainly LOLP (<b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> probability) and LOLE (<b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> expectation) with more emphasis on LOLE as it indicates the expected number of days in the specified periods in which the daily peak load will exceed the available capacity. There are too many other reliability considerations {{to bridge the gap}} between the total generation and total load in any practical power system operation. The addition of generating units in electrical power systems is often viewed as a complex situation and the effects of unit addition on reliability are being investigated in the paper. The reliability indices for load points and the overall system performance have also been studied and a computer program has been developed to examine the effectiveness of the system under investigation by using C-language. The results of simulation runs provide justification for use of the program so developed for the purpose.
