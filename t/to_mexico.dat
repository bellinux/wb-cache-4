5|$|Cortés {{was troubled}} by news that his enemies in New Spain were gaining control of Mexico; when Cortés {{received}} news that Pedro Moreno would soon be arriving in Honduras with many colonists, and official documents from the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, he decided against further exploration and instead returned <b>to</b> <b>Mexico,</b> leaving on 26 April 1526. He took Pizacura <b>to</b> <b>Mexico</b> with him, where he died not long afterwards of a fatal illness. Gonzalo de Sandoval also returned <b>to</b> <b>Mexico,</b> marching overland via Guatemala. Cortés installed his cousin Hernando de Saavedra as governor of the new territory, and left Saavedra with instructions to treat the natives fairly; however Saavedra's actions reopened underlying divisions between rival groups of colonists. Saavedra rapidly established rule over {{what is now the}} department of Olancho; he sent Bartolomé de Celada inland to find a good location for a new Spanish town. He founded Frontera de Cáceras upon the savannah of the Olancho valley, near the Indian towns of Telica and Escamilpa, within the disputed territory between Honduras and Nicaragua.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{probably}} obtained spotted horses through {{trade with}} southern Austria and Hungary, where the color pattern {{was known to}} exist. The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to the Americas when they first arrived in the early 16th century. One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought <b>to</b> <b>Mexico</b> by Cortez, and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604. Others arrived {{in the western hemisphere}} when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th-century Europe, and were shipped <b>to</b> <b>Mexico,</b> California and Oregon.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{trial in}} the death of James Kinne was {{scheduled}} for October 1964; however, in September 1964, Kinne, still free on her $25,000 bond, traveled <b>to</b> <b>Mexico</b> with an alleged lover, Francis Samuel Puglise leaving her children with James Kinne's father and traveling as Pugliese's wife under the name Jeanette Pugliese. The couple later said that they had come <b>to</b> <b>Mexico</b> to get married. Under the legal terms of her bail, Kinne was permitted to leave the country, but her contract with the company that posted her bond prohibited her from leaving Missouri without written permission from the company's agents. After crossing the border, the couple registered at a local hotel, Hotel Gin, again as husband and wife. Kinne, saying that she felt unsafe in the foreign country, bought a pistol—which meant that the couple now possessed multiple guns, having brought one or two with them from the United States.|$|E

5|$|During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly <b>to</b> <b>Mexico</b> City's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982. The {{worldwide}} {{economic crisis}} {{during that period}} resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida {{to the east and}} south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights <b>to</b> <b>Mexico</b> City and Acapulco.|$|E
