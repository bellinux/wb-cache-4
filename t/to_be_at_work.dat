5|$|The nebular {{hypothesis}} {{is the most}} widely accepted model {{in the field of}} cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of the Solar System (as well as other planetary systems). It suggests that the Solar System formed from nebulous material. The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels ("Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens"), published in 1755. Originally applied to the Solar System, the process of planetary system formation is now thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> throughout the Universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular {{hypothesis is}} the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion {{in the same direction as}} the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.|$|E
5|$|An {{outstanding}} problem {{concerning the}} physics governing the narrow Uranian rings is their confinement. Without some mechanism {{to hold their}} particles together, the rings would quickly spread out radially. The lifetime of the Uranian rings without such a mechanism cannot be more than 1million years. The most widely cited model for such confinement, proposed initially by Goldreich and Tremaine, is that a pair of nearby moons, outer and inner shepherds, interact gravitationally with a ring and act like sinks and donors, respectively, for excessive and insufficient angular momentum (or equivalently, energy). The shepherds thus keep ring particles in place, but gradually {{move away from the}} ring themselves. To be effective, the masses of the shepherds should exceed the mass of the ring by at least a factor of two to three. This mechanism is known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{in the case of the}} ε ring, where Cordelia and Ophelia serve as shepherds. Cordelia is also the outer shepherd of the δ ring, and Ophelia is the outer shepherd of the γ ring. However no moon larger than 10km is known in the vicinity of other rings. The current distance of Cordelia and Ophelia from the ε ring can be used to estimate the ring’s age. The calculations show that the ε ring cannot be older than 600 million years.|$|E

Danish and American researchers conducting studies on the genetic contribution to body mass index found correlations between an adoptee's weight class and his biological parents' BMI while finding no relationship with the adoptive family environment. Moreover, about one-half of inter-individual differences were due to individual non-shared influences.|$|E

A third unmanned K-MAX in the U.S. was tested in 2012 to deliver cargo to a small homing beacon with three-meter precision. As of February 2013, the K-MAX had delivered two million pounds of cargo in 600 unmanned missions over more than 700 flight hours.|$|E
500|$|The {{birth of}} the modern widely {{accepted}} theory of planetary formation—the solar nebular disk model (SNDM)—can {{be traced to the}} Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His 1969 book Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets, which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists think about the formation of the planets. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill, who discovered runaway accretion. While originally applied only to the Solar System, the SNDM was subsequently thought by theorists <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> throughout the Universe; as of [...] astronomers have discovered [...] extrasolar planets in our galaxy.|$|E
50|$|Both {{of these}} pitfalls appear <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> during the Asian {{currency}} crises {{of the late}} 1990s.

500|$|Early in his presidency, Hay and Nicolay {{requested}} {{and received}} permission from Lincoln {{to write his}} biography. By 1872, Hay was [...] "convinced that we ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on our 'Lincoln.' I don't think the time for publication has come, but the time for preparation is slipping away." [...] Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his father's papers; by 1875, they were engaged in research. Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincoln's papers, which were not opened to other researchers until 1947. They gathered documents written by others, {{as well as many}} of the Civil War books already being published. [...] They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolay's recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.|$|E

The data required {{for this study was}} gotten through the instrument of questionnaire.

Three hypotheses were formulated from the structured research questions. Regression and correlational analysis <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> test the hypotheses through the statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS 18. 0). The result showed that conducive work environment assists MNCs employee <b>to</b> <b>be</b> motivated <b>at</b> <b>work</b> (R 2 = 0. 546, at P < 0. 05) and that provision of infrastructural facilities have a significant relationship on employee satisfaction (0. 699, at P < 0. 05). The study therefore recommends among others that that organization should see conducive environment and infrastructural development as a way of helping them to continue being in businesses rather than seeing it as a means of luxury to achieve their desires because it has been proven that infrastructural facility development has assisted in enhancing employee satisfaction...|$|R
