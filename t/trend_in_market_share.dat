40|$|In this project, the {{positioning}} of the port of Antwerp is analysed in four subsequent geographical levels: the global scale, continental Europe, the Hamburg-Le Havre range and finally a comparison between Antwerp and Rotterdam. In order to evaluate {{the positioning}} of the ports, we integrate a strategic positioning analysis that incorporates several growth-share matrixes using the BCG-framework, diversification, shift-share and market concentration analyses. The project also implements explanatory factors. The transition from the former superiority of the Triad to the current dominance of Asia was the main result of the global analysis. The Hamburg-Le Havre range remained the largest port range in continental Europe and {{the positions of the}} port ranges have stayed remarkably stable, both in container as well as in total traffic. Within this range, there was a convergence <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> of the 'big four' (Rotterdam, Antwerp, Bremen and Hamburg). The traffic group of containers has risen significantly in portfolio share in almost all ports, which replaced the portfolio share of other general cargo. The ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp are top container ports on all investigated market segmentations. However, although they were considered each other’s greatest competitors in the past, they have now changed their policy to enhance cooperation between each other. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the Netherlands, {{the share}} of the bicycle as the main mode in all person trips has been highly {{constant}} in the past three decades (about 27 %). A constant share is remarkable because developments in this period were mainly unfavourable for bicycle use, like ageing of the population, growing number of immigrants, increasing car ownership, and a tendency to travel larger distances. The analysis of the paper confirms that, if only the autonomous developments on the demand side of the modal choice market are considered, a large majority of these is adverse for bicycle use. Estimations with a model show that, indeed, a decreasing <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of the bicycle could be expected, while a stable trend is observed. Probably, supply-side developments, in particular the long-term bicycle-friendly policy of the Dutch national and local governments, had a significant positive influence on bicycle use...|$|R

The conventional market comprises prime loans for the most creditworthy borrowers and subprime loans for borrowers with impaired credit.

40|$|During {{the past}} two or three decades {{structural}} change in the Australian financial system has been rapid. The system has grown substantially in assets and volumes of activity, {{has become much more}} open and competitive, and has undergone some significant shifts <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> There has also been much innovation in financial products and delivery systems. In analysing these historical trends a useful distinction can be made between two major parts of the financial system: the financial intermediaries (or credit institutions), of which banks form the largest part; and the funds managers, typified by superannuation funds and unit trusts. Although the overlaps between these two institutional groupings are increasing, their historical trends have been driven by rather different forces. Within the intermediaries sector two broad processes of change have been evident. The first involved the interaction between regulatory policy and financial innovation. Prior to the main thrust of financial deregulation in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, banks lost <b>market</b> <b>share</b> to less heavily regulated institutions, a trend that eventually gave impetus to the move to deregulate. In the post-deregulation period, these <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> were reversed and, in the process, the system was opened to greater competition. The second main historical process has been a shift in the economics of production of banks’ traditional financial services – what {{is often referred to as}} a process of ‘unbundling’. This entails a move toward production and pricing of key products on a stand-alone basis, stimulated by the development of specialist suppliers such as mortgage managers or cash management trusts. Competition from these sources has put pressure on the traditional full-service suppliers (the banks) to cut margins and to reduce cross-subsidies. In the funds-management sector, and particularly the superannuation funds, the driving forces have been somewhat different. Policy changes in the areas of taxation and compulsory contributions have had an important impact on the structure of the industry. However, the most important factor behind the rapid growth of the industry since the early 1980 s has been the high average rate of return accumulated on fund investments over that period. The available data do not yet show the increases in net new contributions to the funds expected to result from increases in compulsory contributions. Notwithstanding the historical differences between the two sectors, there have been increasing areas of overlap between them. For example, banks have become more active in funds-management business through subsidiaries, and funds-management institutions have become more active in areas of traditional bank business such as mortgage lending. These developments pose a challenge for regulators as to where are the appropriate regulatory boundaries between the different groups of institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|When this Seminar was {{announced}} {{there were some}} raised eyebrows and the question was asked: Why hold a Seminar on wool marketing {{when the price of}} wool has never been higher? There are a number of good answers to such a question. Firstly although {{it is true that the}} price of wool has never been higher in absolute terms, in relative terms it is low and continually losing ground with respect to competitive fibres and most other comparable commodities. Secondly we thought that the mirage of high prices was engendering an unwarranted complacency in the industry which would not be conducive to the introduction of measures designed to reverse the adverse <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> wool's <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and image with the consumer. Thirdly my wool economics research group had some views, not necessarily new or profound, which they wished to try out on the industry.

40|$|Earlier {{research}} developed theoretically-based aggregate metrics {{for technology}} strategy {{and used them}} to analyze California bridge construction firms (Hampson, 1993). Determinants of firm performance, including <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> contract awards, <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and contract awards per employee, were used as indicators for competitive performance. The results of this research were a series of refined theoretically-based measures for technology strategy and a demonstrated positive relationship between technology strategy and competitive performance within the bridge construction sector. This research showed that three technology strategy dimensions—competitive positioning, depth of technology strategy, and organizational fit— show very strong correlation with the competitive performance indicators of absolute growth in contract awards, and contract awards per employee. Both researchers and industry professionals need improved understanding of how technology affects results, and how to better target investments to improve competitive performance in particular industry sectors. This paper builds on the previous research findings by evaluating the strategic fit of firms' approach to technology with industry segment characteristics.

40|$|The {{state of}} {{business}} in the U. S. automobile industry is such that competition is fierce, and consumers have a perplexing number of alternatives from which to choose. The final purchase decision by the consumer is where most industry experts focus their attention and efforts. Incentives and price wars are common as manufacturers fight for fractional <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and long-term survival {{at the expense of}} corporate profitability. However, the buying decision occurs {{at the end of the}} purchasing process, and takes place only after a consumer has formed a list of acceptable alternatives that fit his/her consideration criteria. This thesis explores the consideration phase of the purchasing process [...] (awareness -> familiarity -> overall opinion -> consideration) [...] with the goal of developing an in-depth understanding that can be used to formulate a strategic recommendation for General Motors regarding improving the consideration levels of several of its brands. The thesis begins with research into the attributes that form consumer consideration sets, as described by marketing and behavioral science scholars. These writings are applicable to brands, products, or services competing in many different industries because I believe strongly that the solutions to consideration problems will not exist solely from within the knowledge base of a firm's core environment. Next, a historical analysis is performed on independently collected consideration data for several General Motors brands as compared with key competitors. This analysis showed that a correlation exists between trends among subsets of consideration data and <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> brand <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> thus supporting the theory that growth can be obtained by addressing the consideration issue. Interviews were(cont.) conducted with marketing and brand management experts and customers from diverse industries around the U. S. Finally, the thesis presents lessons learned regarding experiences in the restoration of consideration after it had previously been lost to other competitors. As a result of this research effort, I present a framework for strategic market planning that is designed to facilitate improvement of the consideration levels of several GM brands more rapidly than their current performance suggests. by Kenneth Darnell Knight.

Many of the estimates suggest that expenditures become decreasing <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> at much lower levels (between 0 % and 10 %). Fixed-effects estimates imply that increases <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> from 20 to 30 percent would be associated with expenditure reductions of 3. 4 % - 6. 6 % in Part A expenditures and 2. 5 % - 5. 6 % in Part B expenditures.

Our paper offers new contributions in testing for unit roots <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> First, a novel feature of our paper is that we propose a new unit root testing methodology designed to deal with the logical consistency requirement <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> models {{within the context of a}} <b>market</b> <b>share</b> attraction (MCI) framework. A second novel component of our paper is that we demonstrate how one could use the Johansen (1995) test to identify unit roots. This is implemented using Eviews software. The Johansen test is a system-based test rather than a single equation test; it is more appropriate given the dependencies <b>in</b> the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> relationships. Finally, we demonstrate using simulations that our procedure works well and improves substantially on the univariate Dickey-Fuller procedure. Accordingly, our procedure leads to better unit root inference than the univariate Dickey-Fuller method; the latter is not that reliable when dealing with <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> We conclude the paper with suggestions for future research...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} estimating a differentiated product demand system that allows for error <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> as measures of choice probabilities. In particular, our approach allows for products with zero sales in the data, which is a frequent phenomenon that arises <b>in</b> product differentiated <b>markets</b> but lies outside the scope of existing demand estimation techniques. Although we find that error <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> generally undermine the standard point identification of discrete choice models of demand, we exploit shape restrictions on demand implied by discrete choice to generate a system of moment inequalities that partially identify demand parameters. These moment inequalities are fully robust to the variability <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> yet are also adaptive to the information revealed by <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>in</b> a way that allows for informative inferences. In addition, we construct a profiling approach for parameter inference with moment inequalities, making it feasible to study models with a large number of parameters (as typically required in demand applications) by focusing attention on a profile of the parameters, such as the price coefficient. We use our approach to study consumer demand from scanner data using the Dominick's Finer Foods database, and find that even for the baseline logit model, demand elasticities nearly double when the full error <b>in</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> is taken into account...|$|R
