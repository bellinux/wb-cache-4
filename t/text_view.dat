The {{collection}} of objects involved permit an application to implement anything from a simple single-line text entry field to a complete multi-page, multi-column text layout schema, with full professional typography features such as kerning, ligatures, running text around arbitrary shapes, rotation, full Unicode support and anti-aliased glyph rendering. Paragraph layout can be controlled automatically or by the user, using a built-in [...] "ruler" [...] object that can be attached to any <b>text</b> <b>view.</b> Spell checking is automatic, using a single dictionary used by all applications that uses the squiggly underlining convention introduced by Microsoft (actually a dashed red underline in Cocoa). Unlimited undo-redo support is built in. Using only the built-in features, one can write a text editor application in as few as 10 lines of code. With new controller objects, this may fall to zero. This {{is in contrast to}} the TextEdit APIs found in the earlier Mac OS.|$|E

5000|$|Westcott and Hort {{distinguished}} four {{text types}} in their studies. The most recent is the Syrian, or Byzantine text-type (eastern), {{of which the}} newest example is the Textus Receptus and thus from the critical <b>text</b> <b>view</b> is less likely reliable. The Western text-type is much older, but tends to paraphrase, so according to the critical <b>text</b> <b>view</b> also lacks dependability. The Alexandrian text-type, exemplified in the Codex Ephraemi, exhibits a polished Greek style. The two scholars identified their favorite text type as [...] "Neutral text", exemplified by two 4th-century manuscripts, the Codex Vaticanus (known to scholars since the 15th century), and the Codex Sinaiticus (discovered in 1859), both of which they relied on heavily (albeit not exclusively) for this edition. This text has only a few changes of the original. This edition {{is based on the}} critical works especially of Tischendorf and Tregelles. The minuscules play a minimal role in this edition.|$|E
50|$|Editing in {{this view}} is an {{intermediate}} step between true WYSIWYG and editing in the regular <b>text</b> <b>view</b> in terms of complexity for the author. The XML elements are made more human-readable and intuitive, but the nesting and semantics of the XML document are still clear. The cursor can be placed between any elements, and when the cursor's position is ambiguous, a tool-tip window will appear showing a local view of the XML tree and the cursor's position in it. A bar {{along the top of}} the view shows the list of elements from the document root to the element under the cursor.|$|E

Simple graphics are thus assembled into such standard widgets as sliders, scroll bars, <b>text</b> <b>views,</b> lists and clipping frames.

As the book is in PDF format, flowing <b>text</b> <b>view</b> is not available and zooming is required for reading on smaller screens.

It is possible to check well-formedness and validity of edited XML data. There is a code completion - overview of feasible elements on given level - feature in the <b>text</b> <b>view</b> available.
