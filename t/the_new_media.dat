5|$|The Hunter Mariners were an Australian {{professional}} rugby league club {{based in}} the Hunter Region's largest city, Newcastle. Hunter was formed in mid-1995 and was later disbanded {{at the end of}} 1997. The club was formed because of the Super League war, which was the rivalry between the traditional Australian Rugby League competition and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>media</b> driven Super League competition. The team competed in the inaugural and only Super League season in 1997, as well as that year's World Club Challenge.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression, which is {{guaranteed}} to Singapore citizens by Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore, is essential to the concept of representative democracy. Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, Speakers' Corner, and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>media.</b> However, Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds. One of these is the protection of reputation. Critics have charged that Cabinet ministers and members of the ruling People's Action Party have used civil defamation suits against opposition politicians to inhibit their activities and exclude them from Parliament. The Government has said that there is no evidence substantiating such claims. In addition, both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government. Article 14 protects the right {{to freedom of}} assembly which is relevant to free speech as the latter is often exercised at assemblies and gatherings. Free assembly is restricted in Singapore through laws that require permits to be obtained before events are held, though an exception is made for indoor events involving organizers and speakers who are citizens.|$|E

For instance, in regards to the CD-ROM encyclopedia Encarta, Microsoft is attempting to convey to the consumer that, “she has purchased not simply an Encyclopedia, but an electronic, and therefore improved, Encyclopedia” (p.46).|$|E
