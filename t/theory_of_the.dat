5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view that the goal of {{mathematics}} is to classify and characterize, the representation <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter. But in association with the Bargmann–Wigner programme, there are (as of 2006) yet unresolved purely mathematical problems, linked to the infinite-dimensional unitary representations.|$|E
5|$|Horrocks was {{the first}} to {{demonstrate}} that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} for designing decision procedures based on <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to simpler ones. Specifically, we define reduction {{functions as a}} tool for reducing <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a complex <b>theory</b> to <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a simpler one. Reduction functions allow us to reduce <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> lists to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> constructors, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> arrays to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> sets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, and <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> multisets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> integers. Finally, we provide a method for combining reduction functions. This method allows us to reduce <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a combination <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> simpler ones. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1918, Einstein {{developed}} a general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{process by which}} atoms emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation (his A and B coefficients), which {{is the basis of}} lasers (stimulated emission) and shaped the development of modern quantum electrodynamics, the best-validated physical theory at present.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Enrico Fermi {{proposed}} the first <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weak interaction, known as Fermi's interaction. He suggested that beta decay {{could be explained}} by a four-fermion interaction, involving a contact force with no range.|$|E
5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of matter, {{which states that}} matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries {{in the field of}} chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms.|$|E

5|$|In economics, the {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} is a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market interest rate.

5|$|Like {{some other}} birds, the Columbidae have no gall bladders.

In fact, however, they do have gall (as Aristotle had earlier realised), which is secreted directly into the gut.|$|E

5|$|The {{system of}} Chinese astrology was {{elaborated}} during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the Han Dynasty (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during {{which all the}} familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heavens, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity, eventually forming stars and planets.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Burhop was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to study at the Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford. Under the supervision of Mark Oliphant, he investigated nuclear fusion. He produced a non-relativistic <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Auger effect in 1935, followed by a relativistic treatment the following year. He later wrote a monograph on the subject. He returned to the University of Melbourne as a lecturer in 1936, and helped Professor Thomas Laby build up the physics department there.|$|E
