500|$|Little {{is known}} of this period of Alkan's life, other than that apart from {{composing}} he was immersed {{in the study of}} the Bible and the Talmud. Throughout this period Alkan continued his correspondence with Ferdinand Hiller, whom he had probably met in Paris in the 1830s, and with Masarnau, from which some insights can be gained. It appears that Alkan completed a full translation into French, now lost, of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from their original languages. In 1865, he wrote to Hiller: [...] "Having translated a good deal of the Apocrypha, I'm now onto the second Gospel which I am translating from the Syriac... In starting to translate the New Testament, I was suddenly struck by a singular idea– <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Jewish to be able to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Seth MacFarlane responded to Palin's criticism, saying that the series always uses satire as the basis of its humor, and that the show is an [...] "equal-opportunity offender." [...] In addition, Andrea Fay Friedman, who voiced Ellen, and who herself has Down syndrome, also responded to the criticisms saying that the joke was aimed at Sarah Palin and not her son, and that [...] "former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor." [...] In a subsequent interview, Friedman rebuked Palin, accusing her of using her son, Trig, as a political prop to pander for votes, saying that she has a normal life and that Palin's son should be treated as normal, rather than like a [...] "loaf of French bread." [...] Later, MacFarlane addressed both Palin's statement and Friedman's rebuttal in an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher calling Palin's outrage a presumptuous attempt to defend people with Down syndrome, and characterizing Friedman's statement as her way of saying that she does not need feigned pity from Palin. Family Guy cast member Patrick Warburton stated that he objected to the joke, saying, [...] "I know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an equal-opportunity offender, but {{there are some things that}} I just don't think are funny." [...] While frequent MacFarlane critic Parents Television Council touched on the Palin controversy in its assessment of the episode, the rest of the show's content—which contained [...] "mean-spirited pot-shots, explicit language, and strong sexual content"—earned the watchdog group's [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] title. The PTC specifically cited the Broadway-style song, which the PTC said [...] "contained all the stereotypes of mental retardation" [...] and [...] "disturbing sexual references," [...] and the climatic scene in the subplot, where Peter pretends to be a psychic, which the PTC said also contained sexual humor.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Hovind started Dinosaur Adventure Land, a Young Earth creationist {{theme park}} located behind Hovind's home in Pensacola, Florida. With the slogan, [...] "Where Dinosaurs and the Bible meet!", the {{facility}} on roughly seven acres had an indoor [...] "Science Center" [...] and an outdoor {{space with a}} variety of simple dinosaur-themed rides and activities, each of which was tied to some religious message. For example, the [...] "Jumpasaurus" [...] was a trampoline next to a basketball hoop; children would have one minute to make as many baskets as they could, and the message was <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coordinated to do more for Jesus. Annual attendance was 38,000. The park depicted humans and dinosaurs co-existing in the last 4,000–6,000 years and also contains a depiction of the Loch Ness monster. The Southern Poverty Law Center said the park also [...] "claims that a few small dinosaurs still roam the planet". A 2004 Skeptical Inquirer article discussed a visit to Hovind's dinosaur theme park and concluded that the park is [...] "deceptive on many levels". In Reports of the National Center for Science Education, George Allan Alderman described it as [...] "essentially a playground with a few exhibits, several fiberglass dinosaurs, a climbing wall, and a couple of buildings." [...] He summarized it as [...] "shabby".|$|E

6000|$|The {{eighteen}} months that followed--for the end came sooner {{than we had}} expected--were, I think, the happiest days {{my father and mother}} had ever known; or if happy be not altogether the right word, let me say the most beautiful, and most nearly perfect. To them it was as though God in His sweet thoughtfulness had sent death to knock lightly at the door, saying: [...] "Not yet. You have still a little longer to be together. In a little while." [...] In those last days all things false and meaningless they laid aside. Nothing was of real importance to them but that they should love each other, comforting each other, learning to understand each other. Again we lived poorly; but there was now no pitiful straining to keep up appearances, no haunting terror of what the neighbours might think. The petty cares and worries concerning matters not worth a moment's thought, the mean desires and fears with which we disfigure ourselves, fell from them. There came to them broader thought, a wider charity, a deeper pity. Their love grew greater even than their needs, overflowing towards at things. Sometimes, recalling these months, it has seemed to me that we make a mistake seeking to keep Death, God's go-between, ever from our thoughts. Is it not closing the door to a friend who would help us would we let him (for who knows life so well), whispering to us: [...] "In a little while. Only a little longer <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> together. Is it worth taking so much thought for self? Is it worth while being unkind?" ...|$|E

Austria gives up the Problem: [...] "We have lost Silesia!" [...] Yes; and, what you hardly yet know,--and what, I perceive, Friedrich himself still less knows,--Teutschland has found Prussia. Prussia, it seems, cannot be conquered by the whole world trying to do it; Prussia has gone through its Fire-Baptism, to the satisfaction of gods and men; and is a Nation henceforth. In and of poor dislocated Teutschland, there is one of the Great Powers of the World henceforth; an actual Nation. And a Nation not grounding itself on extinct Traditions, Wiggeries, Papistries, Immaculate Conceptions; no, but on living Facts,--Facts of Arithmetic, Geometry, Gravitation, Martin Luther's Reformation, and what it really can believe in:--to the infinite advantage of said Nation and of poor Teutschland henceforth. To be a Nation; and to believe as you are convinced, instead of pretending to believe as you are bribed or bullied by the devils about you; what an advantage to parties concerned! If Prussia follow its star--As it really tries to do, in spite of stumbling! For the sake of Germany, one hopes always Prussia will; and that it may get through its various Child-Diseases, without death: though it has had sad plunges and crises,--and is perhaps just now in one of its worst Influenzas, the Parliamentary-Eloquence or Ballot-Box Influenza! One of the most dangerous Diseases of National Adolescence; extremely prevalent over the world at this time,--indeed unavoidable, for reasons obvious enough.

6000|$|And {{now to the}} {{particular}} physics of surf-riding. Get out on a flat board, six feet long, two feet wide, and roughly oval in shape. Lie down upon it like a small boy on a coaster and paddle with your hands out to deep water, where the waves begin to crest. Lie out there quietly on the board. Sea after sea breaks before, behind, and under and over you, and rushes in to shore, leaving you behind. When a wave crests, it gets steeper. Imagine yourself, on your hoard, {{on the face of}} that steep slope. If it stood still, you would slide down just as a boy slides down a hill on his coaster. [...] "But," [...] you object, [...] "the wave doesn't stand still." [...] Very true, but the water composing the wave stands still, and there you have the secret. If ever you start sliding down the face of that wave, you'll keep on sliding and you'll never reach the bottom. Please don't laugh. The face of that wave may be only six feet, yet you can slide down it a quarter of a mile, or half a mile, and not reach the bottom. For, see, since a wave is only a communicated agitation or impetus, and since the water that composes a wave is changing every instant, new water is rising into the wave as fast as the wave travels. You slide down this new water, and yet remain in your old position on the wave, sliding down the still newer water that is rising and forming the wave. You slide precisely as fast as the wave travels. If it travels fifteen miles an hour, you slide fifteen miles an hour. Between you and shore stretches a quarter of mile of water. As the wave travels, this water obligingly heaps itself into the wave, gravity does the rest, and down you go, sliding the whole length of it. If you still cherish the notion, while sliding, that the water is moving with you, thrust your arms into it and attempt to paddle; you will find <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remarkably quick to get a stroke, for that water is dropping astern just as fast as you are rushing ahead.|$|E
