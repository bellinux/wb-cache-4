5|$|Devasena and Valli, the consorts of Murugan, do {{not have}} {{independent}} temples dedicated to them. Their images are installed in shrines of Murugan, where they flank their Lord on either side. They are worshipped with Murugan and receive offerings {{as part of his}} worship (see Puja (Hinduism)). A fast is observed on Tuesdays <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the consort goddesses. Festival icons of Murugan used during temple festival processions generally depict him with his consorts.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1966 {{until the}} end of 1967, President Johnson {{continued}} to dole out sensitive targets one by one to the generals while simultaneously trying <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the doves in Congress and within his own administration with periodic cutbacks and half-hearted peace initiatives. In the end, this erratic course satisfied no one and did little to alter the course of the war.|$|E

5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted <b>to</b> <b>placating</b> the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|R
5|$|He made {{numerous}} {{visits to}} the front in Papua-New Guinea, during September, November and December 1942, July 1943, and June 1944. On his visit to Papua in September 1942, Blamey asked Burston to intercede with Rowell, the relationship between Blamey and Rowell having broken down {{as a result of}} the Rowell's supersession by Blamey on the orders of General Douglas MacArthur and Prime Minister John Curtin. Burston failed <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> Rowell, and Rowell was relieved.|$|E
5|$|July: The {{president}} proclaims Los Alamos, Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) and Hanford Engineer Works (HEW) {{as military}} districts.

5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. As they left the fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Caligula did {{not trust}} the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had {{connections}} with Egyptian separatists. In AD 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus. According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as {{the king of the}} Jews. Flaccus tried <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish synagogues. As a result, riots broke out in the city. Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.|$|E
5|$|During Franklin's administration, Eleanor {{became an}} {{important}} connection to the African-American population {{in the era of}} segregation. Despite the President's desire <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> Southern sentiment, Eleanor was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys. Eleanor became one of the only voices in the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Applewhite and Nettles {{had about}} 80followers, {{many of whom}} held jobs, often working with {{computers}} or as car mechanics. In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families. They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on Mother's Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a monastery. These vacations were intended <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.|$|E
5000|$|By the mid-1950s, however, Dietrich {{by his own}} {{recollection}} was exhausted. In his memoirs, Dietrich recorded: [...] "If {{an executive}} had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If a starlet had <b>to</b> be <b>placated,</b> 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it." ...|$|R

Loki replies that for Thor alone he will leave the hall, because his threats are the only ones he fears. He then leaves.|$|R
5|$|Model's biographer, the {{military}} historian Steven Newton, {{argues that the}} best explanation for Model's behaviour {{is that he was}} not necessarily a Nazi, but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model saw himself as the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed a strong sense of German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German officer corps, but in Model's case it was accompanied by a cynical willingness <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding Godley's efforts <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> him, Allen again {{raised his}} {{concerns}} over the extent of New Zealand's contributions to the war relative to Australia's and sought further explanation for the New Zealand losses of 12 October. Allen was also beginning to query the quality of British generalship. Godley raised {{the prospect of being}} replaced as commander of the NZEF, and proposed Major General Andrew Hamilton Russell, the commander of the New Zealand Division, as his successor. This never eventuated and Godley remained the commander of the NZEF until its disbandment in late 1919.|$|E
5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He {{won the war}} against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E
2500|$|Kanya-Forstner {{describes}} him as [...] "an authoritarian ruler who angered French {{commercial interests}} {{and turned the}} colony into a quasi-military dictatorship". Finding the colony in dire financial straits, he increased taxes on imported cloth from other countries, which went some way <b>to</b> <b>placating</b> the large French commercial houses while alienating local interests in Saint-Louis and Dakar. Militarily, the Senegal colony had recently faced both uprisings in the Wolof states which now make up the coastal heart of Senegal, and powerful states in the interior. [...] The Minister of the Navy issued orders to Governor Brière de l'Isle that no new territory was to be annexed. Despite this he {{began a series of}} expansions through protectorates and direct military control, unprecedented since the highpoint of expansion under the governorship of Louis Faidherbe (1854–1865). Brière de l'Isle oversaw the conquest of French territory in West Africa which would be formalised at the Berlin conference of 1884, beginning the so-called [...] "Scramble for Africa".|$|R

5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this was not enough <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with {{a reduction in the}} number of military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} disappointments, No. 6 Commando's first major {{action as a}} formed unit came in November 1942 when, along with No. 1 Commando, it formed part of the {{spearhead}} for the Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Iain McAlpine, the commando embarked upon HMT Awatea in October 1942 in Glasgow along with some United States Army Rangers that were also {{taking part in the}} operation. Tensions were high between the British and the Vichy French at this time because of a number of clashes and as a result the decision was made for the commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the defenders.|$|E
5|$|Edward sent assurances to the Pope {{that the}} {{conflict}} surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end. On {{the basis of these}} promises, and procedural concerns about the how the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.|$|E

After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.|$|R
60|$|Faith {{explained}} tearfully. The Blythe girls {{sympathized with}} her, and even Mary Vance {{agreed that it}} was a hard position to be in. But Jerry, on whom the thing came like a thunderbolt, refused <b>to</b> be <b>placated.</b> So THIS was what some mysterious hints he had got in school that day meant! He marched Faith and Una home without ceremony, and the Good-Conduct Club held an immediate session in the graveyard to sit in judgment on Faith's case.|$|R
40|$|My work {{cuts through}} the distractions and travesties of modern American life, {{revealing}} the nonsense that multinational corporations spew. Consumption {{as a way of}} life is now a familiar part of the global culture. Political and corporate icons have made their way into individual identity by means of branding, product placement and crossover promotion. They are ubiquitous, embedded in myriad experiences to attract, entertain and satisfy artificially stimulated appetites. Similar <b>to</b> <b>placating</b> drugs, they function like the bread and circuses of the Roman Empire. My process breaks down elements and symbols from the past and present, remixing old and new to create another level of complexity. Media bombardment serves up a steady diet of mind-numbing hindrance. My work is a glitch in the system, a hiccup in the normal. With no formula or recipe to follow, I make work that provokes a memory or an engaging experience. I am attracted to absurdity, I don’t always go looking for it but I keep running into it. The ludicrous often finds its way into my work, creating a stop-the-clock moment. Viewer are caught in the crossfire where the humorous and serious subjects commingle and new thoughts are stimulated...|$|R
5|$|On 17 October 1820, news arrived {{that the}} {{military}} garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to {{what became known as}} the Liberal Revolution of 1820. The military formed a provisional government, supplanting the regency appointed by JoãoVI, and summoned the Cortes—the centuries-old Portuguese parliament, this time democratically elected with the aim of creating a national Constitution. Pedro was surprised when his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided to send him to Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> the revolutionaries. The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona Maria Teresa: JoãoVI had relied on her for advice, and it was she who had been given membership in the Council of State.|$|E
5|$|The {{acceleration}} of the German naval building programme in 1907–1908 forced H. H. Asquith's Liberal Government to yield to public pressure and authorise more ships for the 1909–1910 Construction Programme. Only a single battleship and a battlecruiser had been authorised in 1908–1909, but three battleships and a battlecruiser were authorised in 1909–1910 with another three battleships and a battlecruiser planned as contingency ships <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> {{the public and the}} Admiralty. Continuing pressure forced the Government to announce in July 1909 that the contingency ships would also be built. This pressure also allowed the Admiralty to gain approval to improve the size and power of its new ships so as to maintain qualitative superiority over the new German dreadnoughts then under construction.|$|E
5|$|The only clue {{found at}} the scene is a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button. Mulder and Scully check all of the employees and discover {{that one of the}} clerks, Derwood Spinks, is missing his button. Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record. Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order <b>to</b> <b>placate</b> his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.|$|E

50|$|In March 1919, {{strikes in}} the Ruhr, Mitteldeutschland and Berlin caused the {{government}} <b>to</b> announce <b>placating</b> measures {{that were more}} in line with Wissell's views than with the liberal or socialist approaches. Wissell used the opportunity to push forward a socialization program as well as rules for the coal and potash industries. That would be the first and only victory for the advocates of Gemeinwirtschaft, however. In April, a law that was to set up the regulation of the paper industry was first changed substantially by the cabinet and then rejected by the National Assembly.|$|R
