5|$|In 1876, <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> of the site, in {{a letter}} to a local {{magazine}} denying that he was planning to sell the tree for timber, pointed out that it also represented the revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.|$|E
5|$|The Teesside coroner held an inquest on 12 October 2008 {{that found}} that the finds were {{treasure}} trove {{under the terms of}} the Treasure Act 1996. The rules of treasure trove require that a panel of experts determine the market value of a find, half of which is paid to the finder and the other half to <b>the</b> <b>landowner.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> at Street House waived his share because he wanted to ensure that a local museum would be able to purchase the artefacts. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided Kirkleatham Museum with a grant of £274,000 to fund the purchase and create a new Anglo-Saxon gallery to display the artefacts.|$|E
5|$|At the 1921 {{rally at}} the site, {{following}} a campaign by poet-politician Ventura Gassol, Pi Jove was inaugurated as {{the successor to}} the then-dead main tree. Speaking at the event, Gassol invited <b>the</b> <b>landowner,</b> who was present, to donate the tree to the Commonwealth of Catalonia (a semi-recognised autonomous government), but he declined, saying that practical effort {{is more important than}} symbols.|$|E
50|$|However, {{relations}} between the duke and <b>the</b> <b>landowners</b> were quite hostile. In addition, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was the overlord of the Duchy of Courland, supported <b>the</b> <b>landowners.</b> Wilhelm expressed his disappointment with <b>the</b> <b>landowners,</b> but this ended with his removal from the duke's seat in 1616. Finally, Wilhelm left Courland and {{spent the rest of}} his life abroad. Thus, Friedrich became the only duke of Courland after 1616.|$|R

5|$|Despite this move, {{disputes}} {{regarding the}} shape of land reform continued inside the Government. On July 21, 1848, Nicolae Bălcescu obtained the issuing of a decree to create Comisia proprietății (the Commission on Property), comprising 34 delegates, two for each Wallachian county, representing respectively peasants and landlords. The new institution was presided over by <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> Alexandru Racoviță, and had the Moldavian-born Ion Ionescu de la Brad for its vice president.|$|E
5|$|Leicester County Council {{was able}} to raise £1 million to buy the entire hoard and pay for the {{conservation}} of the helmet, with the assistance of donations from the Heritage Lottery Fund (which gave a £650,000 grant), the Art Fund and other trusts and charities.

5|$|Many people camp on Helvellyn {{throughout}} the year, often near Red Tarn which gives good views of Striding Edge, Swirral Edge, and {{the summit of}} Helvellyn itself. Although camping in England is illegal without the permission of <b>the</b> <b>landowner,</b> there is a tradition of wild camping in the Lake District. This has often been tolerated so long as people have camped unobtrusively, {{for no more than}} one night, and have left no trace of their campsite behind.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016, {{the company}} {{stated that it}} had already {{executed}} easement agreements with 99% of <b>the</b> <b>landowners</b> whose properties lie along the four-state route and, with regards to <b>the</b> <b>landowners</b> along <b>the</b> pipeline's route in Iowa, 99% had entered voluntary easements.|$|R
50|$|Tikoinasau {{strongly}} {{defended the}} rights of indigenous landowners, and criticized laws and constitutional provisions allowing persons not enrolled in the Native Land Register (i.e., Indigenous Fijians) to negotiate lease arrangements with <b>the</b> <b>landowners.</b> <b>The</b> Fiji Times quoted him on 22 December 2005 as saying that not allowing <b>the</b> <b>landowners</b> to dictate <b>the</b> terms of the leases {{was a violation of}} their rights.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> Malay <b>landowners</b> had pawned {{their land}} to 'chettiar' {{a long time}} ago or sell their lands, pieces by pieces, and nowadays, most of <b>the</b> <b>landowners</b> are Chinese.

5|$|Peringskiöld {{commented that}} the stone was {{reclining}} backwards in a hop-garden at the eastern farm of Lövsta, which was later confirmed by Celius in 1726. Stolpe tried to find it, but noted in 1869 that <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> knew of the runestone, but that the latter had reported it to be completely covered in soil, and in 1951, a runologist tried to locate the runestone but failed.|$|E
5|$|The English {{economy was}} {{fundamentally}} agricultural, depending on growing {{crops such as}} wheat, barley and oats on an open field system, and husbanding sheep, cattle and pigs. In the late Anglo-Saxon period many peasants moved away from living in isolated hamlets and instead came together to form larger villages engaged in arable cultivation. Agricultural land became typically organised around manors, and was divided between some fields that <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> would manage directly, called demesne land, {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants. These peasants would pay rent to <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce. By the 11th century, a market economy was flourishing across much of England, while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade. Around 6,000 watermills were built to grind flour, freeing up labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.|$|E
5|$|The site {{is located}} in the greensand belt, 100 feet above sea level. The {{underlying}} geology is a soft sandstone covered with a stratum of white sand. A Scheduled Ancient Monument, the monument is situated on private land although visitors are permitted entry to it on payment of a small fee to <b>the</b> <b>landowner,</b> who resides in the neighbouring house, Rose Alba.|$|E

5000|$|The AAA {{called for}} a {{reduction}} in food production, which would, through a controlled shortage of food, raise the price for any given food item through supply and demand. The desired effect was that the agricultural industry would prosper due to the increased value and produce more income for farmers. In order to decrease food production, the AAA paid farmers to hold some of their land out of production; the money was paid to <b>the</b> <b>landowners.</b> <b>The</b> <b>landowners</b> were expected to share this money with the tenant farmers. While {{a small percentage of}} <b>the</b> <b>landowners</b> did share <b>the</b> income, the majority did not.|$|R

5|$|A lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was {{discovered}} {{at a site}} adjacent to the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the impending commercial development of the site by <b>the</b> <b>landowner,</b> Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave {{was part of a}} larger cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices. One burial was in a substantial stone coffin which had been positioned beneath a mausoleum, the foundations of which remained.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for public viewing by appointment with <b>the</b> <b>landowner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to <b>the</b> <b>landowner.</b> Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|Canada is home {{to about}} 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies {{according}} to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist. Large-scale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government-mandated programs {{in order to support}} populations of endangered prey species such as woodland caribou.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} {{prior to the}} Norman invasion, England's great estates, owned by the king, bishops, monasteries and thegns, had been slowly broken up as a {{consequence}} of inheritance, wills, marriage settlements or church purchases. Most of the smaller landowning nobility lived on their properties and managed their own estates. The pre-Norman landscape had seen a trend away from isolated hamlets and towards larger villages engaged in arable cultivation in a band running north–south across England. These new villages had adopted an open field system in which fields were divided into small strips of land, individually owned, with crops rotated between the field each year and the local woodlands and other common lands carefully managed. Agricultural land on a manor was divided between some fields that <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> would manage and cultivate directly, called demesne land, and the majority of the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants, who would pay rent to <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through cash or produce. Around 6,000 watermills of varying power and efficiency had been built in order to grind flour, freeing up peasant labour for other more productive agricultural tasks. The early English economy was not a subsistence economy and many crops were grown by peasant farmers for sale to the early English towns.|$|E
5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, <b>the</b> <b>landowner,</b> a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E

5|$|On April 28, 2014, {{pedestrian}} {{access to}} the station was partially cut off when the abutting landowner erected a fence on the station's primary access point, forcing riders to walk a short distance along the tracks to a different business lot, {{in an effort to}} stop commuters from parking on his business lots. He removed a section of the fence for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 land sale. Despite intervention by state legislators and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014. In December 2014, the MBTA rejected a plan that would have created a pedestrian access path and a vehicle dropoff lane, alleging that <b>the</b> <b>landowner</b> had unfairly shifted property lines.|$|E
5|$|Poverty, {{the decline}} of the wool {{industry}} in the mid-18th century, increased industrialisation, and rising food prices led to some unrest amongst the inhabitants of Frome, and there were riots during the century. By 1791, the town was described in less flattering terms than those Defoe had used 70 years earlier. In the early 19th century, plans were developed to reinvigorate the town and once again elevate it to its former position as a more important town than Bath. These plans, the idea of a local businessman, Thomas Bunn, mostly failed to come to fruition, although some public buildings were erected and a wide new approach road to the town centre from the south was cut (named Bath Street after <b>the</b> <b>landowner,</b> Lord Bath of Longleat House).|$|E
5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be reduced by half. The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to <b>the</b> <b>landowner.</b> To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.|$|E
