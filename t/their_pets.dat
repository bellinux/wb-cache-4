5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and even <b>their</b> <b>pets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nestlé Purina Petcare is a St. Louis, Missouri-based {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. It produces and markets pet food, treats and litter. Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina ONE. The company {{was formed in}} 2001 by combining Ralston Purina, which was acquired by Nestlé for $10.3 billion, with Nestlé's Friskies Petcare Company. As consumers became willing {{to spend more money}} on <b>their</b> <b>pets,</b> the company grew. As of 2012, it is the second-largest pet food company globally and the largest in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, <b>their</b> <b>pets</b> and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
50|$|The pet {{register}} {{is intended}} for owners {{who are interested in}} how well <b>their</b> <b>pet</b> conforms to the breed standard even though the animal may be neutered or the owner has no intentions of using <b>their</b> <b>pet</b> for breeding.|$|R
50|$|Leslie Irvine argues pet {{ownership}} prompts many to act responsibly, {{with many}} making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, {{and to avoid}} contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity {{for fear of being}} separated from <b>their</b> <b>pet.</b> Additionally, many refuse housing in shelters if <b>their</b> <b>pet</b> is not allowed to stay with them. Homeless pet owners will not sleep in shelters that do not allow pets, they will pass on the opportunity for housing if they cannot take <b>their</b> <b>pet,</b> and they will sacrifice their meal if food is limited. The role of caregiving to <b>their</b> <b>pet</b> is constructed as their primary reason for being in life. The pet is dependent on them for food and care and this gives the owner a sense of responsibility and a positive self-image and self-worth.|$|R

5|$|Nestlé Purina Petcare is {{operated}} as {{a subsidiary of}} Nestlé. It is headquartered in St Louis, Missouri and has operations in North America, Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and Oceania. There are sixteen buildings on 50 acres at its headquarters, including a four-story research facility built in 2010 and a Learning and Training center built in 2011. In 2010, Purina built the $10 million Purina Event Center for dog shows and competitions. Nestlé Purina Petcare sponsors various charitable activities, such as the Pet Care Pride Day annual event where employees do volunteer work. Employees are allowed to bring <b>their</b> <b>pets</b> to work. The company has on-site gyms, physical fitness trainers, medical care, and an employee turnover of approximately 5 percent.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{breeding}} {{populations are}} in Russia (up to 500,000pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines {{in much of}} the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through pesticide use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are adversely affected by disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where dog owners allow <b>their</b> <b>pets</b> to run loose, successful nests tend to be far from footpaths or human habitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid {{due to the}} 3D {{platforming}} and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials. The items needed to lure endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and <b>their</b> <b>pets</b> must also be avoided, distracted or stunned by a thrown object. For example, a phone card {{can be used to}} make a prank call to lure a householder away, catnip can be used to distract cats.|$|E
50|$|Dog hiking {{refers to}} a form of hiking in which dogs travel {{alongside}} their owners. It is most commonly done by dogs' owners when they go hiking to enjoy the companionship of <b>their</b> <b>pet,</b> to avoid having to leave <b>their</b> <b>pet</b> home, for added safety, and also to help provide some extra haulage capacity.|$|R

25|$|Pet names often {{reflect the}} owner's {{view of the}} animal, and their {{expectations}} they have for their companion.

25|$|Although {{white was}} not always a {{recognized}} color in the various German Spitz breeds, it was generally the preferred color in the US.

25|$|Humans {{typically}} have deep attachments to their dogs because dogs are adept at fulfilling emotionally supportive roles in people's lives {{which results in}} high levels of attachment. Dog owners who are single, childless, newly married, empty nesters, divorced, or in a second marriage tend to anthropomorphize <b>their</b> <b>pets</b> more often. Dogs can be emotional substitutes for family members such as children and spouses and they contribute to the moral maintenance {{of people who live}} alone.|$|E

25|$|Another scholar drew a {{connection}} between the microwave scene and urban legends about pets dying in microwave ovens. He described the portrayal of this urban legend in the film as successful, but that meant it seemed terrible.

After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.|$|E
25|$|Due to the breed's stoic nature, {{injuries}} can {{go unnoticed}} {{for a time}} as the dog will not give obvious signs of pain or distress like whining. For example, the first indication of a cut on the foot might be limping or favoring that foot {{a few days after}} the actual injury, so owners should be aware of <b>their</b> <b>pets</b> usual movement to spot irregularities. Excessive licking of a spot may also indicate a problem other than the skin conditions listed above.|$|E
50|$|The Richmond SPCA has {{a strict}} policy for relinquishing pets. Relinquishing pets, {{also known as}} surrendering, is when a pet owner decides to sign over their legal rights as a pet owner, pay a fee, and leave <b>their</b> <b>pet</b> with an animal shelter. Space is {{sometimes}} limited, so the Richmond SPCA cannot always admit new pets. There is however a waiting list for both cats and dogs to be relinquished to this shelter. As space becomes available the admissions department contacts members {{on the waiting list}} to schedule an appointment to discuss the relinquishment of <b>their</b> <b>pet.</b> “While pets are on the waiting list, our staff helps the owners resolve behavioral issues, gets the pet fully inoculated and spayed or neutered.” By the shelter doing this, families often decide in keeping <b>their</b> <b>pet</b> or finding him or her a new home on their own ("Richmond SPCA").|$|R
