5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over the rear of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> {{the front of the}} tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} weight reductions, a series of novel weight-saving measures were taken. The original round-ended nose design (which was to have resembled the EMD F7 nose used on the B class Diesel) was shortened and squared off to allow the frame to be reduced in size and weight, reducing the depth of <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> <b>and</b> requiring <b>the</b> driver to enter <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> via <b>the</b> engine room. Masonite was used in place of sheet metal to line <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> interior, <b>and</b> acrylic sheet was used in place of glass on some of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> windows.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the two airliners lost in the April and May 1958 collisions, {{investigators}} from a House of Representatives committeeconcerned about the lack of coordination between civil and military air traffic controllersimposed a 60-day deadline on <b>the</b> <b>CAB</b> <b>and</b> the Air Force to establish new control procedures. The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions.|$|E
5|$|From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 {{lightweight}} tender locomotives were {{allocated to}} Goole shed, and were soon {{operating on the}} Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield {{and all of the}} seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> <b>and</b> was low enough to provide good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and {{a new type of}} superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was investigated by <b>the</b> <b>CAB</b> <b>and</b> included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB {{concluded that the}} momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> <b>and</b> that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E

5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E
25|$|Following {{withdrawal}} from service a number of RM class were stored around the country.

40|$|An {{intriguing}} {{property of}} many organisms is {{their ability to}} exhibit rhythmic cellular events that continue independently of environmental stimuli. These rhythmic processes are generated by an endogenous mechanism known as the biological clock. We wished to determine whether Arabidopsis thaliana {{will serve as a}} model plant system for a molecular genetic dissection of the circadian clock. To this end, we investigated the expression of Arabidopsis chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (<b>cab)</b> genes throughout <b>the</b> circadian cycle. Steady-state mRNA levels of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>cab</b> 3 genes showed a dramatic circadian cycling in plants shifted from light/dark cycles to constant darkness, whereas <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> 1 mRNA level exhibited little or no cycling under the same conditions. Analysis of cab promoter fusions in transgenic tobacco revealed that both <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>cab</b> 2 5 [prime] upstream regions confer circadian-regulated expression on a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) reporter gene. In vitro nuclear run-on transcription assays also indicated that the transcription of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>cab</b> 2 genes is circadian regulated in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these data suggest that a post-transcriptional mechanism influences cab 1 mRNA levels in Arabidopsis. The identification of circadian-regulated cis-acting elements in <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>cab</b> 2 upstream regions will provide powerful tools for both molecular and genetic analysis of the higher plant circadian clock...|$|R
