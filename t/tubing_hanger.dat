2500|$|Production tubing is {{the main}} conduit for {{transporting}} hydrocarbons from the reservoir to surface (or injection material the other way). [...] It runs from the <b>tubing</b> <b>hanger</b> {{at the top of}} the wellhead down to a point generally just above the top of the production zone.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tubing</b> <b>hanger</b> is a {{component}} {{used in the}} completion {{of oil and gas}} production wells. It is set in the tree or the wellhead and suspends the production tubing and/or casing. Sometimes it provides porting to allow the communication of hydraulic, electric and other downhole functions, as well as chemical injection. It also serves to seal-in the annulus and production areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{workover}} {{begins by}} {{killing the well}} then removing the wellhead and possibly the flow line, then installing a B.O.P commonly known as a blow out preventer, then lifting the <b>tubing</b> <b>hanger</b> from the casing head, thus beginning to pull the completion out of the well. The string will almost always be fixed in place {{by at least one}} production packer. If the packer is retrievable it can be released easily enough and pulled out with the completion string. If it is permanent, then it is common to cut the tubing just above it and pull out the upper portion of the string. If necessary, the packer and the tubing left in hole can be milled out, though more commonly, the new completion will make use of it by setting a new packer just above it and running new tubing down {{to the top of the}} old.|$|E
50|$|During the 2009/10 season {{takes place}} the third {{car of the}} team, the CAT03. The team has 25 members and the car was new again. This time, half of the team had last years’ experience, which will {{facilitate}} the transfer of knowledge essential for a project of this type. The goal remains to reduce weight. Even get a final weight {{very similar to the}} previous model was to improve the rigidity of the chassis with steel pipes. The main improvement over the CAT02 were suspensions. It was decided to continue using the same technology, despite having had problems in the use of adhesives on <b>tubing</b> <b>hangers.</b> After several tests they were able to eliminate the problems of previous years. In terms of competition, that year it attends to three competitions, with the addition of Argentina to the FS competition calendar. Thus, the CAT03 went to competitions in Germany, Italy and Spain; substantially improved results with respect previous seasons, especially in Italy where they get a 12th position.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} briefly {{the main}} components of a deep water WOR and presents results of the structural and fatigue analyses on some of the most critical regions of the riser under normal conditions. The thesis considers both <b>Tubing</b> <b>hanger</b> mode for a 355 m stack up and Tree running modes for three different cases (400 m, 1000 m and 2000 m) ...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{operations}} regarding the <b>tubing</b> <b>hanger</b> crown plugs {{and the internal}} tree cap are studied and analyzed based on experience data collected from the Statoilo perated fields of Norne, Gullfaks, Åsgard and Heidrun. The Internal Tree Cap (ITC) has been analyzed considering operations involving puling of the lower <b>Tubing</b> <b>Hanger</b> Crown Plug (THCP) through the ball valve. Due {{to the extent of}} the problems seen with operating the ball valve, the cap is recommended pulled before pulling the lower crown plug. A contingency procedure is described in form of a decision tree, and should be use if the cap for some reason is not pulled. For the lower THCP problems have been identified for both pulling and setting operations. Problems with the Upper Wireline Plug (UWLP) are mostly during setting operations. For the lower THCP premature setting of the plug {{is one of the main}} problems. The premature setting is seen in connection with use of a brass pin as the upper shear pin in the CPHRT. A steel-steel combination for the two shear pins in the hydraulic running tool is therefore recommended. The CPHRT should also always be checked for water intrusion in order to ensure that the pistons in the RT are free to move all theway down when trying to lock the dogs into the <b>tubing</b> <b>hanger</b> nipple profile. It is recommended that the number of pistons in the running tool and the setting pressure should follow the table given in the Halliburton manual. Different methods have been used for pulling the THCP. Equalizing across the plug isseen as a necessity for a successful pulling operation. The pulling method with the highest success rate is the”Pressure up above” method. This method is currently just in use for the RLWI system but it is recommended that it be adapted and used for pulling through the WOR. Braided wire should be used when pulling the plug. Displacing fluid through the ¼” TCI-line between the upper and lower plug is seen asone of the challenges when trying to set the UWLP. Calculations done for setting inthe WOR and MR show that the pressure needed in the riser is dependent on the displacement velocity. The higher the pressure in the riser the faster the fluid willdisplace through the TCI-line. In the MR only hydrostatic pressure is available so alonger displacement time should be accounted for. A design failure with the UWLP setting tool has been investigated. When the runningtool is set in compression, a premature energizing of the plug locking dogs can occurand the plug is not able to set. It is recommended that the running tool should be held in tension until the plug has landed and it should be evaluated if a re-design of the tool is needed. New technology regarding the crown plugs is presented. This new technology includes an equalizing crown plug, a motorized setting tool and a pulling/jetting toolall under development for FMC Technologies. Best practice guidelines are developing for the installation and retrieval of the crown plugs based on the analyses performed. Best practice guidelines and recommendations are also made for operating the ITC. The analysis and recommendations given in this thesis should be used as a basis for developing a finalized best practice for crown plug operations. </p...|$|E
40|$|With the key {{drivers of}} rising energy demand and {{increasing}} prices, major operators are expanding {{their search for}} new hydrocarbon reserves, moving into deeper water, more hostile environments and targeting smaller pools and more remote reserves. [...] Thus, other type of challenges rise ahead, which require developing of new innovative, cost effective, and safe technology to put these fields into production. [...] One of Canada's important offshore areas {{that is expected to}} feed into the continental energy market is the East Coast offshore fields located on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and Labrador. In addition to the conventional challenges that accompany any offshore field development activity, wellhead protection from icebergs {{remains one of the most}} important challenges and takes the priority in any intended development on the Grand Banks. So far, several design strategies for iceberg risk mitigation have been suggested, and some are being already adopted, such as the glory hole concept which proved to be an efficient protection measure but at a high capital cost. [...] The thesis work gives a general overview of the oil and gas industry on the Grand Banks with a focus on the various strategies and concepts for the protection of the wellheads on the Grand Banks, and their application for marginal fields' development. [...] The present study favors the use of a shear link wellhead as a protection mechanism against floating and gouging icebergs, and accordingly an evaluation study was done for this system. [...] A detailed structural analysis was conducted, by performing a study to determine the wellhead section stresses generated due to a floating /gouging iceberg wellhead accidental interaction. The response of the well upper section (conductor and wellhead) to ice gouges and to floating icebergs events was analyzed by a 3 -D finite element numerical model using ABAQUS software. The parametric computations and creation of the ABAQUS input file employed a MATLAB code. The result was a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between floating/ gouging icebergs, soil mechanics and the subsea wellhead sections, where not much detailed engineering, structural and analytical work has been done previously. [...] The calculated stresses and their distribution along the wellhead sections were used to address the structural reliability and integrity of the well by highlighting the stress levels and loads on: the down-hole safety valves, the isolation valve on top of the hanger, the conductor stress limit (buckling), completion tubing stress limits (buckling and rupture), the shear key and the wellhead components. Another purpose for this analysis was to present a guide for the detailed engineering, which is not addressed in this thesis, of the shear link and the suggested isolation valve on top of the <b>tubing</b> <b>hanger.</b> [...] A detailed overview of well structure (Casing and Completion) and sealing barriers failure modes leading to leak paths and loss of well integrity is presented in the work where the probability of a leak occurrence in the event of X-mas tree displacement in the suggested system is done. Suggested intervention and work-over sequence to put the well into production following the event of an iceberg impact to the wellhead leading to the loss of the X-mas tree and the upper part of the well was discussed taking into consideration the safety of the operation and highlighting the practicality of the shear link wellhead system...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to provide input for {{choosing}} the optimal X-mas Tree (XT) configuration for a subsea production system. The subsea XT is used to direct, regulate, and stop the flow from a well. These functions and some more are achieved through several valves, a subsea control module, and some sensors. The choke valve has the worst inherent reliability of the components on a XT. Because of this the choke valve is designed for easy retrieval. The choke valve could also {{be placed in a}} separate flow control module. The subsea control module is the XT component with the second worst reliability. Both these components are modules because it is good method of improving system maintenance of unreliable components. The main XT configurations are the vertical XT, the horizontal XT, and the deepwater vertical XT. The main differences are how the main valves are placed and how the tubing with <b>tubing</b> <b>hanger</b> is installed. In subsea reliability it is common to use mean time to failure as a performance indicator and the exponential distribution to model lifetimes. A Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) analysis is frequently used to analyze the subsea production system. RAM analysis software use reliability block diagrams, flow diagrams, and Monte Carlos next event simulation to simulate the lifetime and the availability of the subsea production system. Two main sources of reliability data for subsea components are OREDA and SubseaMaster. When applying component reliability data in a RAM analysis, this often give a lower availability than experienced in real life. This could relate to how, from when, or from where the data are collected. Expert judgment can be used to calibrate the data so that the model fit the real life scenario. The sensitivity and uncertainty of assumptions and the analysis should also be considered. The model and analysis can then be used to optimize the reliability of the design. In OREDA the vertical XT has a lower inherent reliability than the horizontal XT. The low reliability may relate to the large share of older generation vertical XTs installed. Understanding the quality of the data is difficult and decisions should not be taken {{solely on the basis of}} unprocessed data. A key difference between the XT configurations is the maintainability of the tree and the tubing. Wells that are expected to have many tubing failures should be equipped with a horizontal XT and a vertical XT should be on a well with few tubing failures. This is mainly due to the order of which the components are installed as the HXT allows the tubing to be retrieved without retrieving the tree and vice versa for the VXT. A failure on the wellhead connector will have a large impact on the availability. Interventions on the horizontal XT are done with a blowout preventer. The height of both these components puts more strain on the wellhead than the other XT configurations. Tripping out tubing is one of the more dangerous operations in a well; this combined with the extra strain on the wellhead may cause bad consequences. This may give an advantage for the VXT in a risk perspective. A horizontal XT with a flow control module will have improved maintainability, but this adds potential leak paths and makes the design more complex. The vertical XT and deepwater vertical XT are easier to retrieve and may be better off with a simpler design without the flow control module. The deepwater vertical XT is easier to maintain than a vertical XT. It may be a good choice of configuration for wells with a medium amount of tubing failures. The DVXT is more complex and has more leak paths than the other two configurations and may have a higher infant mortality because of this. OneSubsea help their customers choose XT configuration with a tree selector tool. Ranking the importance of different aspects give an output of how the XT configurations fit this ranking. This gives a good indication of which configuration to choose for a well. CAPEX and OPEX are important factors in the decision process. A RAM analysis would give an overall look on the reliability and life cycle cost of the subsea production system. RAM analysis software is able to process the many varying factors that impact the optimal XT configuration for a subsea production system and should be the foundation of the decision process...|$|E
