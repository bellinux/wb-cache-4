500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake. The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> wanted to paint a picture lyrically that {{might be seen as}} a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's what some of the parts of being human are about, {{and this is what we}} can be at our worst.' So it's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Barzun Donnelly {{recommended}} to Hynes that he consider Lou Taylor Pucci {{for the lead}} role of Mercer, believing that he was [...] "perfect". Hynes watched Pucci's 2005 film Thumbsucker and thought that [...] "We'd be so lucky to have him." [...] He contacted Pucci about the role but was leaving for Norway {{in less than a}} week to attend a friend's wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving. Pucci was in San Francisco on a press tour and Hynes flew from Los Angeles to have lunch with him. Hynes said of the meeting, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> [...] each other," [...] and Pucci accepted the role a week later. Jena Malone signed on to portray Joely because she [...] "loved the script" [...] and was keen to play [...] "a woman on the cusp of learning to toy with her [...] sexual manipulation"; she only later learned that Hynes had written the role with her in mind, having previously worked with her on the short film Al as in Al. Hynes said that Zooey Deschanel, Maura Tierney, and Bill Duke each joined the cast because they [...] "read [...] and really liked it". He made a deliberate attempt to cast Deschanel and Malone against their previous types. He described Deschanel as a [...] "glamour girl" [...] and Malone as a sexually mature woman.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. Regarding {{the pace of}} the two-parter {{and the rest of the}} season episodes, he said, [...] "American Horror Story is always about a slow rollout of the season of reveals. The pace of these two is a little slower. The scenes are longer and I think more thoughtful than {{the pace of the}} first three. These are two of my favorite episodes in the history of the show. Also, in these episodes, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> understand the world a little more and what we're trying to write about which is the horror of the insane asylum back in the '50s and '60s and the degradation and the abuse, the real-life horrors. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> hit that in a great way in the Anne Frank story." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2013 Enele Sopoaga {{said that}} {{relocating}} Tuvaluans {{to avoid the}} impact of sea level rise [...] "should never be an option because it is self defeating in itself.

2500|$|The {{threat of}} climate change to the islands is not a {{dominant}} motivation for migration as Tuvaluans appear to prefer to continue living in Tuvalu for reasons of lifestyle, culture and identity. In 2013 Enele Sopoaga, {{the prime minister of}} Tuvalu, said that relocating Tuvaluans to avoid the impact of sea level rise [...] "should never be an option because it is self defeating in itself.

2500|$|While some {{commentators}} {{have called for}} the relocation of Tuvalu's population to Australia, New Zealand or Kioa in Fiji, in 2006 Maatia Toafa (Prime Minister from 2004–2006) said his government did not regard rising sea levels as such a threat that the entire population {{would need to be}} evacuated.

2500|$|The New Girl {{production}} {{offices are}} on the Fox lot in Los Angeles, next to those of Homeland. New Girl had 11 writers during its first season and 15 during the second season, half of them male. Stories are developed in a collaborative effort and are aimed at viewers of all genders. The first season had no planned story arcs, but focused on setting up the characters, while the second season was to show different sides of the characters. Overarching storylines usually culminate at a season's end; the actors are generally not told the ending. Meriwether said the writers did not [...] "have a lot of plans. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> just {{to try to go}} where the show wants to go." [...] The writers challenge themselves to create new stories and to change the show's dynamics to keep things fresh, while aiming to be [...] "as emotionally real as possible" [...] with [...] "Every story having to feel like it was grounded in some emotional arc as opposed to going from the joke into the story." [...] As the show's jokes rely on the actors' performance instead of perfectly constructed punch lines, Meriwether looks for the actors' strengths before writing. The A story generally revolves around Jess and has an emotional core. Still, Meriwether sees the show as an ensemble about friendship with [...] "everybody having their own stories and people being interested in all of the characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of {{the wreckage of the}} R.M.S. Titanic in 1985 attracted Yeston's interest in writing a musical about the famous disaster. [...] "What drew me to the project was the positive aspects of what the ship represented – 1) humankind's striving after great artistic works and similar technological feats, despite the possibility of tragic failure, and 2) the dreams of the passengers on board: 3rd Class, to immigrate to America for a better life; 2nd Class, to live a leisured lifestyle in imitation of the upper classes; 1st Class, to maintain their privileged positions forever. The collision with the iceberg dashed all of these dreams simultaneously, and the subsequent transformation of character of the passengers and crew had, it seemed to me, the potential for great emotional and musical expression onstage." [...] Librettist Peter Stone and Yeston knew that the idea was an unusual subject for a musical. [...] "I think if you don't have that kind of daring damn-the-torpedoes, you shouldn't be in this business. It's the safe sounding shows that often don't do well. You have to dare greatly, and I really want to stretch the bounds of the kind of expression in musical theater," [...] Yeston explained. [...] Yeston saw the story as unique to turn-of-the-century British culture, with its rigid social class system and its romanticization of progress through technology. [...] "In order to depict that on the stage, because this is really a very English show, I knew I would have to have a color similar to the one found in the music of the great composers at that time, like Elgar or Vaughan Williams; this was for me an opportunity to bring in the musical theater an element of the symphonic tradition that I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> haven't had before. That was very exciting." ...|$|E

60|$|One {{afternoon}} I {{was sitting}} outside the Cafe de la Paix, watching the splendour and shabbiness of Parisian life, and wondering over my vermouth at the strange panorama {{of pride and}} poverty that was passing before me, when I heard some one call my name. I turned round, and saw Lord Murchison. We had not met since we had been at college together, nearly ten years before, so I was delighted to come across him again, and we shook hands warmly. At Oxford we had been great friends. I had liked him immensely, he was so handsome, so high-spirited, and so honourable. We used to say of {{him that he would}} be the best of fellows, if he did not always speak the truth, but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> admired him all the more for his frankness. I found him a good deal changed. He looked anxious and puzzled, and seemed to be in doubt about something. I felt it could not be modern scepticism, for Murchison was the stoutest of Tories, and believed in the Pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the House of Peers; so I concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was married yet.|$|E
5000|$|Topher's {{arrival and}} {{induction}} into {{the group was}} not entirely well received, with reviewer Paul Brian McCoy mentioning [...] "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> needed to introduce new characters yet since we still don’t really know who these kids and their parents are." ...|$|E

5000|$|Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue {{consists}} of four lines of minimalist lyrics which are about youthful boredom and inhaling the solvent vapors contained in glue.

We did a lot more pre-session demos, not just with Albini, but also using an 8-track reel-to-reel that we had bought to record our practices. It really changed the way we were able to work out the songs. It also helped us school ourselves a bit on how to engineer a basic recording.” ...|$|E
