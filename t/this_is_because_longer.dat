30|$|Figure  4 a {{shows that}} {{synchronization}} judgment {{is based on}} the value of r ranging between 0.9 and 0.95. Ultimately, the trend of the synchronization is not reached. Due to the expansion of network scale, Fig.  4 b has been unable to intuitively provide the difference between different network structures. From Table  2, the degree of the nodes is essentially at normal distribution, but the average length of path is long. Pursuant to the analysis for small-scale networks, we conclude that the synchronization of the system can be severely restricted if the distance between nodes in the network is long and the shortest average distance distribution is not uniform. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>longer</b> distance gets the communication among nodes blocked. Compared with small-scale network in Fig.  3 a, the synchronization state can be achieved at a certain stage of evolution, while the network in this scale is unable to even reach the synchronization of the whole viewpoint in a short time. Therefore, the shortest average length of distance in a network structure is an important index to ensure the synchronous evolution result, meaning the shortest average distance needs to be within a limited range to ensure that the synchronous evolution achieves better results. At the same time, the high clustering coefficient can cause the local node to be too close, falling into local synchronous state. Apparently, it will cause difference comparing with the overall synchronization effect.|$|E

The improvement in the propagation loss indicated the diffusion of the QD layers and an unintentional passivation of the device. When measuring the propagation loss, shorter waveguides from the batch of devices were cleaved instead of using actual DUTs. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>longer</b> devices will give much finer mode spacing, and this would result in less accurate data.|$|R

30|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the {{duration}} of the CFP phase has {{a significant impact on the}} delay encountered by the HP traffic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because,</b> the <b>longer</b> the CFP (to accommodate the several LP flows in a network), the more the time required for the system to transition into the CP, thereby making the HP traffic wait for a longer period of time to get an opportunity to transmit their delay sensitive data. We intend to address this issue in a quantitative manner in our future study. In Section 4, we provide a numerical analysis of the above fact. We want to emphasize that an absence of LP traffic flow in the network will make our scheme behave exactly in the standard 802.11 e fashion. Thus, no undue delay will be encountered by the HP traffic flows. In summary, the extra opportunity to transmit data by the LP flows during the CFP phase leads to significant increase in their throughput with minor dent in the delay performance of the HP flows.|$|R

The polarization resistance of Ti 36 in normal saline containing fluoride decreases by one order of magnitude as compared to that of pure normal saline just on immersion whereas the difference increases to three orders of magnitude after 240 hours of immersion. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> at <b>longer</b> immersion times, the fluoride ion is able to interfere in the anodic dissolution process, resulting in a significant increase in anodic current density.

40|$|As {{software}} defined radio (SDR) becomes more prevalent in wireless communications nowadays, a symbol timing recovery (STR) system with configurability of the symbol rate would be {{required in order to}} support different wireless standards. Convergence time i. e. how much time needed to achieve a synchronous status during alignment of timing phase, is one of the factors to determine STR performance. In the existing multi-symbol-rate STRs, convergence time varies depending on the moment of the symbol rate switching even without considering noise effect. A longer convergence time results in more initial errors in the symbol decision. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> undesirable <b>because</b> <b>longer</b> preamble bits <b>are</b> required for synchronization thus reducing the throughput rate. This paper presents a configurable STR using digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms, with fast convergence time that can be achieved by searching for the minimum timing error (which occurs at the optimal sampling instant) within each symbol period, and then capturing the associated optimal symbol sample at the zero-crossing of the filtered signal. The convergence time is calculated based on the predefined symbol period regardless the moment of the symbol rate switching. The proposed configurable STR is implemented using Xilinx Virtex- 4 FPGA. Implementation results show that at least 21 % of the FPGA hardware utilization has been saved for the proposed configurable STR as compared to the existing configurable STRs. 6 page(s...|$|R

Here, we present {{an investigation into the}} microlensing characteristics of haloes with spatially varying PDMFs and anisotropic velocity dispersion tensors. One attractive possibility – suggested by baryonic dark cluster formation in pregalactic and protogalactic cooling flows – is that the inner halo is dominated by stellar mass objects, whereas low mass brown dwarfs become more prevalent on moving outwards. The contribution to the microlensing rate must be dominated by dark remnants (∼ 0. 5 M⊙) to recover the observed timescales of the microlensing experiments. But, even though stellar remnants control the rate, they do not dominate the mass of the baryonic halo, and so the well-known enrichment and mass budget problems are much less severe. Using a simple ansatz for the spatial variation of the PDMF, models are constructed in which the contribution of brown dwarfs to the mass of the baryonic halo is ∼ 55 % and to the total halo is ∼ 30 %. An unusual property of the models is that they predict that the average timescale of events towards M 31 is shorter than the average timescale towards the LMC. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the <b>longer</b> line of sight towards M 31 probes more of the far halo where brown dwarfs are the most common constituent...|$|R

Fibre laser surface treatment reduced the surface hardness and produced smaller crack lengths in comparison with the as-received surface.
