5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath,</b> often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E
25|$|Tendons form in {{the embryo}} from {{fibroblasts}} which become more tightly packed as the tendon grows. As tendons develop they lay down collagen, which is the main structural protein of connective tissue. As tendons pass near bony prominences, they are protected by a fluid filled synovial structure, either a <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath</b> or a sac called a bursa.|$|E
25|$|A ventral forearm muscle, the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) {{originates}} on {{the anterior}} {{side of the}} radius distal to the radial tuberosity and from the interosseous membrane. It passes through the carpal tunnel in a separate <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath,</b> after which it lies between {{the heads of the}} flexor pollicis brevis. It finally attaches onto the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve (C7-C8) It is a persistence of one of the former contrahentes muscles that pulled the fingers or toes together.|$|E

25|$|Horses may acquire cellulitis, usually {{secondarily}} to a wound (which can {{be extremely}} small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath,</b> or joint. Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{high hopes}} that the Red Sox would finally vanquish their nemesis from the Bronx, the series started disastrously for them. Curt Schilling pitched with the torn <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath</b> in his right ankle he had {{suffered}} in Game 1 of the Division Series against Anaheim, and was routed for six runs in three innings. Yankee starter Mike Mussina had six perfect innings, and held an 8–0 lead. Despite the Sox' best effort to come back (they scored seven runs to make it 8–7), they ended up losing 10–7. In Game 2, already with his Yankees leading 1–0 {{for most of the}} game, John Olerud hit a two-run home run to put the New York team up for good. The Sox were soon down three games to none after a 19–8 loss in Game 3 at home. In that game, the two clubs set the record for most runs scored in a League Championship Series game. At that point in the history of baseball, no team had come back to win from a 3–0 series deficit (only the 1998 Atlanta Braves and 1999 New York Mets had ever gotten as far as a Game 6).|$|E

500|$|The Yankees won {{the first}} three games of the series, {{including}} a 19–8 rout in Game 3. No team {{in the history of}} baseball had ever won a best-of-seven series after being down three games to none. Entering {{the bottom of the ninth}} inning of Game 4 at Fenway Park, Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera was attempting to close out a 4–3 lead. But after issuing a leadoff walk to Kevin Millar, pinch-runner Dave Roberts stole second and came around to score on an RBI single by Bill Mueller. Boston won the game in the bottom of the 12th inning on a home run by David Ortiz. Game 5 featured another extra-inning Boston comeback, as the Red Sox tied the game in the 8th inning, and won it in the 14th on a single hit by Ortiz that drove in Damon from second to make it 4-3 Red Sox. In Game 6, Curt Schilling, who tore a <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath</b> in his right ankle during the American League Divisional Series against Anaheim, pitched seven innings of one-run ball. 4 innings in and the Yankees had still yet to get a hit off Schilling. Schilling's tendon was sutured to his ankle to relieve the discomfort and was given local anesthetic and painkillers for the game. During the game, his sock started to absorb the blood from his freshly sutured ankle, dubbed [...] "the bloody sock". During the game a controversial call was called on Alex Rodriguez when he knocked the ball out of Arroyo's hand on his sprint to first. Boston won the contest, 4–2. They then completed their historic comeback with a blowout win in Game 7, by a score of 10–3. New York Yankees blowing the 3–0 lead has been considered the biggest collapse in the history of the rivalry.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the anti-adhesive mechanisms of PXL 01 in sodium hyaluronate (HA) {{by using the}} rabbit lactoferrin peptide, rabPXL 01 in HA, in a rabbit model of healing <b>tendons</b> and <b>tendon</b> <b>sheaths.</b> The mechanism of action for PXL 01 in HA is interesting since a recent clinical study of the human lactoferrin peptide PXL 01 in HA administered around repaired tendons in the hand showed improved digit mobility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On days 1, 3, and 6 after tendon injury and surgical repair, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) {{was used to assess}} mRNA expression levels for genes encoding the mucinous glycoprotein PRG 4 (also called lubricin) and a subset of matrix proteins, cytokines, and growth factors involved in flexor tendon repair. RabPXL 01 in HA was administered locally around the repaired tendons, and mRNA expression was compared with untreated repaired <b>tendons</b> and <b>tendon</b> <b>sheaths.</b> RESULTS: We observed, at all time points, increased expression of PRG 4 mRNA in tendons treated with rabPXL 01 in HA, but not in <b>tendon</b> <b>sheaths.</b> In addition, treatment with rabPXL 01 in HA led to repression of the mRNA levels for the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, and IL- 8 in <b>tendon</b> <b>sheaths.</b> CONCLUSIONS: RabPXL 01 in HA increased lubricin mRNA production while diminishing mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators, which in turn reduced the gliding resistance and inhibited the adhesion formation after flexor tendon repair...|$|R
30|$|Synovial sarcoma is a {{malignant}} neoplasm of soft tissues. It occurs {{mainly in the}} extremities and {{is closely related to}} <b>tendons,</b> <b>tendon</b> <b>sheaths,</b> and bursal structures. Primary synovial sarcoma of the pleura and lungs is extremely rare.|$|R
40|$|The primary lesion in gonococcal {{infection}} {{is determined by}} the portal of entry and by the ability of the gonococcus to survive in the given environment. The spread of infection from the primary lesion may be directly along the mucous membrane, by the lymphatics, or by the blood stream. Once the organisms enter the circulat-ing blood they are cleared rapidly. Commonly, they focalize in the joints or <b>tendon</b> <b>sheaths</b> where they are able to survive.

50|$|In this condition, {{cartilaginous}} metaplasia {{takes place}} within the synovial membrane of the joint. Metaplastic synovium organizes into nodules. With minor trauma, nodules are shed as small bodies into the joint space. In some patients, the disease process may involve <b>tendon</b> <b>sheaths</b> and bursal sacs.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Tendon</b> and {{synovial}} <b>sheath</b> {{disease is}} common. A method of monitoring {{the status of}} <b>tendons</b> and <b>sheaths</b> is important for both diagnosis of pathology and evaluation of the efficacy of treatments. For this study, an ultrasound scoring tool was developed and its reliability tested between raters. The tool is novel in that it scores <b>tendons</b> and <b>sheaths</b> separately, an important consideration since disorders of these structures are not necessarily concurrent. Methods: Thirty diseased <b>tendons</b> and <b>sheaths</b> were included in this pilot cross-sectional study. <b>Tendon</b> and <b>sheath</b> measurements were taken and the semi-quantitative five-grade score was applied to assess tendon greyscale, tendon Doppler activity and sheath Doppler activity. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement exercises were undertaken to test {{the reliability of the}} scoring tool. Results: The Intra-class Correlation Coefficient values for both the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability tests showed excellent agreement for the <b>tendon</b> and <b>sheath</b> measurements. Unweighted kappa estimations for inter-rater scores showed excellent agreement for tendon Doppler; good agreement was shown for scoring sheath Doppler, while poor agreement was shown for tendon grey-scale scoring. The intra-rater reliability scores demonstrated similar results. Conclusion: Overall, the study strongly supports the use of this scoring tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of <b>tendon</b> and <b>sheath</b> disorders. The results may be used as a starting point from which to base further work in this important area. Future studies should address the limitations found in this research with a strong focus on improving tendon grey-scale measurement accuracy and agreement...|$|R

50|$|A {{synovial}} sheath {{is one of}} the two membranes of a <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath</b> {{which covers}} a tendon. The other membrane is the outer fibrous <b>tendon</b> <b>sheath.</b> The tendon invaginates the synovial sheath from one side so that the tendon is suspended from the membrane by the mesotendon, through which the blood vessels reach the tendon, in places where the range of movement is extensive. The mesotendon disappears or remains in the form of narrow tendinous bands as threads known as vincula tendina.|$|E
