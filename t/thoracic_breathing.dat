40|$|Objectives: Konstantin Buteyko, M. D., Ph. D., {{claimed that}} breath holding time (BHT) {{can be used}} to detect chronic {{hyperventilation}} and that BHT predicts alveolar CO 2 (Paco 2) according to his patented mathematical formula. The Buteyko Breathing Technique (BBT) is believed to correct chronic hyperventilation as evidenced by increased BHT. In this study, we test Buteyko&# 039;s claims and explore the relationship between BHT and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) as well as measures of dysfunctional breathing (DB) including the Nijmegen questionnaire, the Self Evaluation of <b>Breathing</b> Questionnaire, and <b>thoracic</b> dominant <b>breathing</b> pattern. Subjects: Eighty-three (83) adults healthy or suspected of having dysfunctional breathing, 29 with abnormal spirometry readings, 54 with normal spirometry. Outcome measures: BHT, performed according to BBT protocols, was measured along with ETCO 2 and other measures of DB including the Nijmegen questionnaire, and manual assessment of respiratory motion, a palpatory technique for measuring thoraco-abdominal balance during breathing. Correlations between measures of DB were made in the whole sample and also in subgroups with normal or abnormal spirometry. DB measures were compared in normal and abnormal spirometry groups. Results: The results revealed a negative correlation between BHT and ETCO 2 (r = − 0. 241, p < 0. 05), directly opposite to Buteyko&# 039;s claims. BHT was significantly shorter in people with abnormal spirometry (FEV 1 or FVC < 15 % below predicted), with no difference in ETCO 2 levels between the abnormal and normal spirometry groups. In the abnormal spirometry group, lower BHT was found to correlate with a <b>thoracic</b> dominant <b>breathing</b> pattern. (r = − 0. 408, p < 0. 028). Conclusions: Although BHT does not predict resting ETCO 2, it does correlate with breathing pattern in subjects with abnormal spirometry. It is proposed that altered breathing pattern could contribute to breathing symptoms such as dyspnea and that breathing therapies such as BBT might influence symptoms by improving the efficiency of the biomechanics of breathing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{radiation}} therapy, {{the estimation}} of torso deformations due to respiratory motion is an essential component for real-time tu-mor tracking solutions. Using range imaging (RI) sensors for continuous monitoring during the treatment, the 3 -D surface motion field is recon-structed by a non-rigid registration of the patient’s instantaneous body surface to a reference. Typically, surface registration approaches rely on the pure topology of the target. However, for RI modalities that addition-ally capture photometric data, we expect the registration to benefit from incorporating this secondary source of information. Hence, in this pa-per, we propose a method for {{the estimation of}} 3 -D surface motion fields using an optical flow framework in the 2 -D photometric domain. In ex-periments on real data from healthy volunteers, our photometric method outperformed a geometry-driven surface registration by 6. 5 % and 22. 5 % for normal and deep <b>thoracic</b> <b>breathing,</b> respectively. Both the qualitative and quantitative {{results indicate that the}} incorporation of photometric information provides a more realistic deformation estimation regarding the human respiratory system. ...|$|E

This study investigates a technique for evaluating and quantifying {{breathing pattern}}, called the Manual Assessment of Respiratory Motion (MARM) and compares it to measures performed with Respiratory Induction Plethysmography (RIP). About 12 subjects altered their breathing and posture while 2 examiners assessed their breathing using the MARM. Simultaneous measurements with RIP were taken. Inter-examiner agreement and agreement between MARM and RIP were assessed. The ability of the measurement methods to differentiate between diverse breathing and postural patterns was compared. High levels of agreement between examiners were found with the MARM for measures of the upper rib cage relative to lower rib cage/abdomen motion during breathing but not for measures of volume. The measures of upper rib cage dominance during breathing correlated with similar measures obtained from RIP. Both RIP and MARM measures methods were able to differentiate between abdominal and <b>thoracic</b> <b>breathing</b> patterns, but only MARM was able to differentiate between breathing changes occurring as result of slumped versus erect sitting posture.

40|$|Abstract. Detection, {{analysis}} and compensation of respiratory motion {{is a key}} issue {{for a variety of}} medical applications, such as tumor tracking in fractionated radiotherapy. One class of approaches aims for predict-ing the internal target movement by correlating intra-operatively cap-tured body surface deformations to a pre-operatively learned deformable model. Here, range imaging (RI) devices assume a prominent role for dense and real-time surface acquisition due to their non-intrusive and markerless nature. In this work we present an RI based statistical model built upon sparse principal axes for body surface deformations induced by respiratory motion. In contrast to commonly employed global models based on principal component analysis, we exploit orthomax rotations in order to enable the differentiation between distinctive and local res-piratory motion patterns such as <b>thoracic</b> and abdominal <b>breathing.</b> In a case study, we demonstrate our model’s capability to capture dense respiration curves and the usage of our model for simulating realistic distinctive respiratory motion patterns. ...|$|R

Different examples of the experimental preparation in the presence of stimuli of different kinds are analysed. The resultant signal patterns are found to be self-consistent and capable of exhibiting systematically differing features in systematically differing experimental conditions, thus supporting the validity of the analysis and the choice of the estimator. It is concluded that a more detailed analysis of the requirements of this approach is then warranted. Such requirements are discussed, and, specifically, results that bear on the adequacy of spatial sampling rate are presented.

Several groups have analysed the feasibility of using the Kinect camera to monitor respiratory motion for respiratory gated or four-dimensional CT-based continuous radiotherapy [3 – 5]. Though the results seem promising, to our knowledge, no clinical studies utilising the Kinect have been published yet. The Kinect-based respiratory motion monitoring systems are mostly compared with the RPM Gating System (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA, USA), a clinically available respiratory motion tracking system that utilised the movement of a marker box placed on the patient’s chest to gate radiation therapy. This system is not suitable for interventional procedures because the box has to be placed on disinfected skin and can easily be knocked out of place. As it only tracks the movement of a single marker, it {{would not be able to}} detect a change in breathing pattern either. During interventional procedures, patients are more likely to alter from <b>thoracic</b> to abdominal <b>breathing,</b> or vice versa, rendering the tracking inaccurate. The value of skin surface motion tracking in combination with a tightly positioned vacuum mattress is that all respiratory movement can be visualised and thus be used as patient feedback.|$|R

40|$|The use of ephedrmne in the {{induction}} of spinal anesthesia was recommended by Ockerblad and Difion (1). However, {{the exact nature}} of the spinal anesthetic crises which they sought to pre-vent remains a matter of controversy. Seevers and Waters (2) interpret spinal anesthetic accidents as the result of gradual anoxemic damage to central structures, dependent upon the abolition of <b>thoracic</b> <b>breathing.</b> They be-lieve this damage is the consequence of impaired circulation, developing from intercostal insu. fficiency combined with the de-pression of other muscular elements. Bowers (3) and others agree fundamentally with Seevers and Waters. Ferguson and North (4) also emphasize the importance of the abolition of thoracic respiration. Although these investigators expressly deny the existence of any pooling of splanchnic blood in spinal anesthetic crises, they recommend the use of ephedrine supple-mentary to oxygen or artificial respiration. If the pooling of blood in spinal anesthesia can be ruled out, vasopressor effects cannot be entirely responsible for the unquestioned benefits of ephedrine. Lundy (5), and Burch and Harrison (6), have stressed the value of ephedrmne as a circulatory stimulant in their experimental study of spinal anesthesia. The pharmacodynamic evidence presented in this paper sup-ports the assumption that there is an intrinsic analeptic effect of ephedrine upon medullary centers during procaine depression...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Breathing {{disturbances}} during snoring {{have been}} quantified by face mask pneumotachography and oesophageal catheters. In order to nonobtrusively investigate respiratory mechanics during nonapnoeic snoring {{in relation to}} sleep disturbances, we employed calibrated respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP). In 10 snorers, RIP recordings were studied during nonapnoeic snoring without arousals in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, nonapnoeic snoring with repe-titive arousals in NREM sleep and wakefulness. Results were compared to RIP recordings in undisturbed NREM sleep and wakefulness in seven healthy non-snorers. Compared to wakefulness and undisturbed NREM sleep in nonsnorers, snoring was associated with predominant <b>thoracic</b> <b>breathing,</b> ribcage/abdominal asynchrony, and increased fractional inspiratory time. Preceding arousals during snoring, inspi-ratory flattening of time-derivatives of RIP volume signals, and marked ribcage/abdom-inal asynchrony indicated pronounced flow limitation. Low variation coefficients of respiratory cycle time (< 10 %) and tidal volume (< 20 %) discriminated snoring periods without arousals from snoring periods with arousals and from wakeful-ness periods, with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 99 %. Snoring periods with arousals were identified {{by the presence of}} snoring combined with high coef-ficients of variation of cycle time (≥ 10 %) and tidal volume (≥ 20 %), with a sensi-tivity of 96 % and a specificity of 100 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} and hypopnea {{syndrome}} (OSAHS) is a disorder that causes clinical symptoms (e. g. snoring, {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} and impaired concentration) that may {{increase the risk of}} traffic accidents, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and reduce the quality of life. A recently developed device (Somnolter®) detects apneas and hypopneas in a home setting, allowing to detect OSAHS in a more comfortable environment compared to the gold standard polysomnography. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the Somnolter® is useful in family practice to identify patients with OSAHS. METHODS: Questionnaires were offered to patients in five general practitioner (GP) practices. Based on the questionnaire and body mass index, patients with an increased risk of OSAHS were contacted to collaborate in the study. In this convenience sample, 18 patients were successfully tested with the Somnolter® measuring SaO 2, mandibular movements, body position, heart rate, nasal air flow and <b>thoracic</b> and abdominal <b>breathing</b> movements. The Somnolter® automatically analyses the data and different parameters to detect OSAHS. Afterwards, the data were manually revised by the researchers. RESULTS: Out of 365 subjects, 31 met the inclusion criteria and 18 were successfully tested at home. Sixteen out of 18 patients had an Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) [*]≥[*] 5, ten of them had mild OSAHS, 3 were categorized as moderate OSAHS and finally 3 matched the criteria of severe OSAHS. CONCLUSION: The proposed case-finding strategy still needs optimization, but is considered helpful in selecting patients at high risk of OSAHS. OSAHS was detected in 14 out of 18 patients tested with the Somnolter®. In the future the Somnolter® might be a feasible alternative to diagnose OSAHS...|$|R
40|$|Background: The normal inspiratory to expiratory {{ratio is}} 1 : 2. However, the {{duration}} of inspiration can be increased voluntarily till the ratio becomes 2 : 1. This is called as inverse ratio breathing. The effects of inverse ratio ventilation have been studied on patients with respiratory failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. No studies {{have been carried out}} to study the effects of inverse ratio breathing in voluntarily breathing individuals. Hence this study was carried out to find the immediate effects of inverse ratio breathing versus diaphragmatic breathing on inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion. Methods: 30 healthy adult females in the age group 20 - 25 years were included in the study. Inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion at 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostal space was measured using a digital spirometer and an inelastic inch tape respectively. Diaphragmatic breathing was administered for one minute and the same parameters were measured again. A washout period of one day was given and same outcome measures were measured before and after individuals performed inverse ratio breathing {{with the help of a}} visual feedback video for one minute. Results: Data was analysed using Wilcoxon test. There was extremely significant difference between the mean increase in the inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion at the 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostals space after inverse ratio breathing as compared to diaphragmatic breathing (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion increase significantly after inverse ratio breathing.

40|$|Background The {{commonly}} held idea that &# 039;proper&# 039; breathing {{is important for}} health is generally accompanied by the view that incorrect or &# 039;dysfunctional&# 039; breathing has adverse effects on health. It has been proposed that correction of dysfunctional breathing through breathing therapy reduces symptoms and improves the health of patients with conditions such as asthma, anxiety, speech disorders, chronic muscular skeletal dysfunction and medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, investigation {{of the impact of}} dysfunctional breathing and breathing therapies is hampered by the fact that dysfunctional breathing is not well defined and that there are few validated measures or standard ized protocols to measure it. Aims The four main objectives of the experimental portion of thesis are: • To further develop and validate some clinical tools for assessment of dysfunctional breathing; • To explore and evaluate current methods for assessing dysfunctional breathing particularly those used by breathing therapists; • To investigate the relationships between measures of dysfunctional breathing with a view to understanding the possible definitions and dimensions of dysfunctional breathing; and • To explore possible mechanisms of breathing therapy. Method A series of seven studies were untaken. Various non-experimental and quasi-experimental study designs were used These papers, which are all published (or in press) manuscripts, form the experimenta l portion of this thesis. The seven studies presented in the empirical section of this thesis are grouped in four sub-sections - The first of these contains two studies on the topic of &# 039;Measuring Breathing Pattern&# 039;, the second contains one study on the topic &# 039;Evaluating Dysfunctional Breathing Symptoms&# 039;, the third include two studies that investigate &# 039;Relationships between Measures of Breathing Functionality&# 039; and the final sub-section contains two studies that explores &# 039;Measures of Dysfunctional Breathing and Breathing Therapy&# 039;. Results/Discussion Manual techniques for evaluating breathing pattern appear to be useful and reasonably accurate for evaluating <b>thoracic</b> dominant <b>breathing</b> and paradoxical breathing. The Self Evaluation of Breathing Quest ionnaire appears to have two dimensions that might be related to biochemical and biomechanical aspects of breathing dysfunction. Poor relationships between different categories of measures of dysfunctional breathing suggest that dysfunctional breathing has several dimensions. Breathing pattern appears to moderate dyspnea and altering breathing pattern may be one mechanism of breathing therapy. Conclusion While dysfunctional breathing cannot be strictly defined at present, for practical purposes dysfunctional breathing is probably best characterized as multidimensional. Dysfunctional breathing can occur in at least three dimensions: biochemical, breathing pattern and breathing related symptoms and these might not co-exist.   Comprehensive measurement of dysfunctional breathing should include measures that evaluate all these dimensions. The therapeutic mechanisms of breathing theory are likely to be comple x and include psychological, biomechanical and physiological parameters. However, dysfunctional patterns of breathing are one factor that influences patients&# 039; response to breathing therapy. Also correction of dysfunctional breathing patterns is one likely therapeutic pathway of breathing therapy, particularly for patients with dyspnea...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Respiratory motion during deep breathing and lung volumes were measured in 20 patients (mean age 65 years, SD 16) before and after median sternotomy. Chest x-rays were analyzed pre- and postoperatively and a variety of perioperative variables were measured. RESULTS [...] Average abdominal motion decreased to 57 % of preoperative values bilaterally 1 week postoperatively, the average lower thoracic motion decreased to 72 %, and the average upper thoracic motion decreased to 87 %, whereas the right upper thoracic motion increased 3 % compared with preoperative values. Lung volumes decreased to around 60 % of preoperative values (p< 0. 05). Significant correlations were found between the decrease in pulmonary function and the mean respiratory movements.

Method: Cross-sectional study with mouth breathers (initial n= 116 and final n= 48) and nasal breathers (initial n= 131 and final n= 24) from elementary school, aged between 7 and 14 years. Chest expansion, using cirtometry, the breathing pattern {{and the use of}} accessory muscles, by means of clinical evaluations and photogrammetry, and flexibility tests were evaluated in both groups. Subsequently, the mouth breathers were asked to complete the quality of life questionnaire. Statistical tests: Chi-square, odds ratio, Mann-Whitney, and binomial tests were first applied followed by logistic regressions. Results: <b>Thoracic</b> <b>breathing</b> (p= 0. 04), using of accessory muscles (p= 0. 03) and reductions in flexibility (p= 0. 001) increased the chances of an individual being a mouth breather when compared to nasal breathers. Subsequently, using of accessory muscles decreased the chances of snoring among mouth breathers (p= 0. 03); the presence of shoulder asymmetry reduced the chances of experiencing quiet sleep (p= 0. 05) and increased the chances of coughing or being tired when playing or running (p= 0. 008). Finally, forward head position reduced the chances of waking up at night (p= 0. 04) and experiencing shortness of breath (p= 0. 05). Conclusions: Respiratory and postural adaptations increased the chances of individuals persisting with mouth breathing. Additionally, these adaptations could be associated with mouth breathers' self-perceived quality of life...|$|E
40|$|A 7 {{year old}} spayed female Labrador Retriever {{presented}} to Cornell University Hospital for Animals’ (CUHA) Orthopedic Service for progressive hind limb lameness/paresis {{two weeks in}} duration. She was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a younger dog. She was treated with deracoxib and dexamethasone, but only responded transiently to the latter. Upon presentation to CUHA she was paraplegic with absent pelvic limb proprioception. Pain {{was present at the}} level of T 10 -T 11. A complete blood count revealed thrombocytopenia and a stress leukogram. The chemistry panel showed an increase in liver enzymes. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Thoracic radiographs revealed no obvious lesions. Differential diagnoses included, in order of priority, fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE), neoplasia, intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) and infectious disease (e. g. neospora, rabies). An abdominal ultrasound was conducted the following day and did not disclose any neoplasia. An MRI showed a large lesion in her spinal cord suggestive of an infarct, but no evidence of compression. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was suggestive of a primary central nervous system disease. These results ruled out IVDD and supported FCE or neoplasia as the top differentials. Nine days after admission, the patient’s lung sounds were increased and she had moderate difficulty <b>breathing.</b> <b>Thoracic</b> radiographs did not reveal overt signs of aspiration pneumonia, but this was the presumptive diagnosis. She was placed on oxygen, started on enrofloxacin and ampicillin with sulbactam and treated with nebulization and coupage. The following morning, she began to show vestibular signs. Later that morning, she had a seizure, which was treated with diazepam, but seizures recurred. The owners elected euthanasia later that day. Her body was submitted for necropsy, which ultimately revealed CD 3 + intravascular neoplastic cells, consistent with intravascular T cell lymphoma. Neoplastic cells were identified in sections of the brain, spinal cord, liver, stomach and lung. This is a rare neoplasia that is reported in the dog, and is also described in humans. This neoplasia is often neurotropic in nature; however, the mechanism of this tropism is currently unknown...|$|R
40|$|Key points Excessive exercise-induced {{shortness}} of breath is a common complaint. For some, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is the primary cause and for a small minority {{there may be an}} alternative organic pathology. However for many, the cause will be simply reaching their physiological limit or be due to a functional form of dysfunctional breathing, neither of which require drug therapy.; The physiological limit category includes deconditioned individuals, such as those who have been through intensive care and require rehabilitation, as well as the unfit and the fit competitive athlete who has reached their limit with both of these latter groups requiring explanation and advice.; Dysfunctional breathing is an umbrella term for an alteration in the normal biomechanical patterns of breathing that result in intermittent or chronic symptoms, which may be respiratory and/or nonrespiratory. This alteration may be due to structural causes or, much more commonly, be functional as exemplified by <b>thoracic</b> pattern disordered <b>breathing</b> (PDB) and extrathoracic paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder (pVFMD).; Careful history and examination together with spirometry may identify those likely to have PDB and/or pVFMD. Where there is doubt about aetiology, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be required to identify the deconditioned, unfit or fit individual reaching their physiological limit and PDB, while continuous laryngoscopy during exercise is increasingly becoming the benchmark for assessing extrathoracic causes.; Accurate assessment and diagnosis can prevent excessive use of drug therapy and result in effective management of the cause of the individual’s complaint through cost-effective approaches such as reassurance, advice, breathing retraining and vocal exercises.; This review provides an overview of the spectrum of conditions that can present as exercise-­induced breathlessness experienced by young subjects participating in sport and aims to promote understanding of the need for accurate assessment of an individual’s symptoms. We will highlight the high incidence of nonasthmatic causes, which simply require reassurance or simple interventions from respiratory physiotherapists or speech pathologists...|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} {{world in which we}} live, we are {{surrounded}} by portable electronic devices limited in terms of time and energy, by the batteries they need and utilize. There are abundant types of energies in the environment which, in fact, represent an infinite source, such as the one produced by human. We might take advantage and utilize this energy in our favour and thus, we could have an extra source of power for our portable electronic devices. This thesis aims to discuss a design method for the fabrication of an active fibre composite (AFC) capable of producing electric energy from body movements, such as the stretching of the thigh when walking or the stretching produced in the <b>thoracic</b> cavity when <b>breathing.</b> These types of movements would exert a bending stress and a force of around 1 N in the composite. An AFC is a composite composed by a polymer matrix, which contains piezoelectric fibres inside, able to produce electric energy when submitted to stress (and vice-versa) and some electrodes which are responsible of conducting the electricity between the fibres and either the battery or directly the electronic device. As a result of this research, a promising method has been proposed in order to fabricate the composite utilizing SBXTM liquid resist emulsion, PZT 5 A piezoelectric fibres and an interdigitated electrode (IDE). For this IDE, three techniques have been attempted: evaporation, sputtering and screen-printing, made from a combination of gold and chromium, aluminium and from silver epoxy respectively. In this thesis, two polymers namely PDMS and SBX have been considered as a matrix, SBX being more adequate. Two different ways to align the fibres in the polymer matrix were proposed, aligning with designed masks and with a rig frame. Tests results and graphs have been generated with regard to the behaviour of SBX in terms of shrinkage when casted and the relation between the rotational speed and thickness when spun. This investigation also contains data with relation to the curing and development of the SBX, in addition to mechanical tests done to different samples with a Deben Microtester. Eventually, some ideas have also been included on how to arrange carbon or glass fibres around the PZT fibres in a later stage, so as to enhance the stress by applying increased stress in different places along them...|$|R
