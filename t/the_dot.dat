5|$|The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) {{concluded}} in 1975 that DST might reduce the country's electricity usage by 1% during March and April, but the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) reviewed <b>the</b> <b>DOT</b> study in 1976 {{and found no}} significant savings.|$|E
5|$|The {{pale blue}} color of <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> {{is the result}} of {{polarization}} and scattering of the light reflected from Earth. The polarization in turn depends on various factors such as cloud cover, exposed areas of oceans, forests, deserts, snow fields etc.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the intersubband {{electronic}} properties of two laterally coupled dome-shaped InAs/GaAs quantum <b>dots</b> were investigated. <b>The</b> envelope functions and eigenenergies were calculated as function of distance between <b>the</b> <b>dots.</b> <b>The</b> coupling between <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> was studied using transition lifetime between <b>the</b> <b>dots.</b> <b>The</b> {{results showed that}} in close distances (smaller than 3 nm) <b>the</b> quantum <b>dots</b> are coupled and by increasing the distance transition lifetime fall down drastically and <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> become uncoupled.

50|$|Example: A {{player has}} the seven of <b>the</b> <b>Dots</b> tiles and <b>the</b> nine of <b>the</b> <b>Dots</b> tiles, he {{requires}} the eight of <b>the</b> <b>Dots</b> tiles {{to complete the}} winning hand. He cannot declare his combination of tiles to be a Sequence Hand if another player discards the eight of <b>the</b> <b>Dots</b> tiles. That is, the four point awarded to the Sequence Hand does not count. He can, however, still win the game by virtue of other points he has already scored, by drawing animals for example. But, if he manages to draws the eight of <b>the</b> <b>Dots</b> tiles by himself(自摸zì-mō), his winning combination {{is considered to be}} a Sequence Hand.|$|R
5000|$|Connect <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> (also {{known as}} dot to <b>dot</b> or join <b>the</b> <b>dots)</b> {{is a form}} of puzzle {{containing}} a sequence of numbered dots.

5|$|The Department of Transportation Act, {{passed on}} October 15, 1966, {{the same day}} as the National Historic Preservation Act, {{included}} provisions that addressed historic preservation. <b>The</b> <b>DOT</b> Act is much more general than Section 106 NHPA in that it refers to properties other than those listed in the Register.|$|E
5|$|The station {{broadcasts}} traffic {{reports for}} the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metro area with {{data provided by}} the Minnesota Department of Transportation. From 1989 to 2005, the station was paid approximately $400,000 by <b>the</b> <b>DOT</b> for this service. MnDOT had planned to cancel the contract, but due to public demand the state continued the relationship.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of <b>the</b> <b>DOT,</b> the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), regulates safety for the U.S. trucking industry. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs {{set by the}} Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for interstate commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways known as the National Network (NN). Provided the truck remains on the NN, it {{is not subject to}} state limits. These limits (which can be lower or higher than federal limits) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic, provided the vehicle is not on the NN.|$|E
30|$|Note {{that there}} are two types of space charge {{distribution}} around the QDs: (1) a uniform spherical surface distribution with a radius greater than the exciton Bohr radius, which results in no change to the electronic wave function of <b>the</b> <b>dots,</b> and (2) an inhomogeneous charge distribution around <b>the</b> <b>dots,</b> which can change the excitonic wave function in <b>the</b> <b>dots.</b> In this study, the distribution of cationic adsorbents is considered nonuniform and the uniform charge distribution around <b>the</b> <b>dots,</b> which has not been evidenced so far, is not considered.|$|R
40|$|Coupled {{quantum dots}} are {{potential}} candidates for qubit systems in quantum computing. We use a non-invasive voltage probe {{to study the}} evolution of a coupled dot system from a situation where <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> are coupled to the leads to a situation where they are isolated from the leads. Our measurements allow us to identify the movement of electrons between <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> and we can also identify the presence of a charge trap in our system by detecting the movement of electrons between <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> and <b>the</b> charge trap. The data also reveals evidence of electrons moving between <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> via excited states of either <b>the</b> single <b>dots</b> or <b>the</b> double <b>dot</b> molecule.

2500|$|Later in September 2009, <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> {{were changed}} to spheres yet {{again when the}} network's current slogan Welcome Home was launched. <b>The</b> <b>dots</b> were made smaller like the old logo. It also began to reuse the iconic [...] "Still The One" [...] theme tune in its idents. In March 2010, Adelaide and Perth {{stations}} finally revived <b>the</b> <b>dots,</b> after four years since using the unified identity.|$|R
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT {{conservatively}} {{identified a}} 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS review of <b>the</b> <b>DOT</b> study found {{no differences in}} traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on <b>the</b> <b>dot.</b> This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
50|$|In the {{adjacent}} image, the solid lines correspond to actual particles (of momentum p1 and so on), while <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> line {{corresponds to a}} virtual particle carrying momentum k. For example, if the solid lines were to correspond to electrons interacting {{by means of the}} electromagnetic interaction, <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> line would correspond to the exchange of a virtual photon. In the case of interacting nucleons, <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> line would be a virtual pion. In the case of quarks interacting by means of the strong force, <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> line would be a virtual gluon, and so on.|$|R
40|$|We {{fabricated}} GaAs/AlGaAs {{quantum dots}} by droplet epitaxy method, and obtained the geometries of <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> from scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} data. Post-thermal annealing is essential for the optical activation of quantum dots grown by droplet epitaxy. We investigated the emission energy shifts of <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> and underlying superlattice by post-thermal annealing with photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements, and specified the emissions from <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> by selectively etching the structure down to a lower layer of quantum <b>dots.</b> We studied <b>the</b> influences of the degree of annealing on the optical properties of <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> from <b>the</b> peak shifts of the superlattice, which has the same composition as <b>the</b> <b>dots,</b> since <b>the</b> superlattice has uniform and well-defined geometry.

25|$|In matrix multiplication, {{there is}} a {{distinction}} between the cross and <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> symbols.

25|$|In other words, <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> {{product of}} {{transformed}} image and a template {{is equal to}} <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> product of original image and inversely transformed template.

25|$|All Morse code {{elements}} depend on <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> length. A dash is {{the length of}} 3 dots, and spacings are specified in number of dot lengths.

40|$|We {{consider}} a superconducting film, placed upon a magnetic dot array. Magnetic moments of <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> are normal {{to the film}} and randomly oriented. We determine how the concentration of the vortices in the film depends on the magnetic moment of a dot at low temperatures. The concentration of the vortices, bound to <b>the</b> <b>dots,</b> {{is proportional to the}} density of <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> and depends on the magnetization of a dot in a step-like way. The concentration of the unbound vortices oscillates about a value, proportional to the magnetic moment of <b>the</b> <b>dots.</b> <b>The</b> period of the oscillations is equal to the width of a step in the concentration of the bound vortices.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} Ge-rich dots on Si(100), grown by molecular beam epitaxy.

5000|$|If {{the effect}} of a passage was <b>dotted,</b> <b>the</b> {{compelling}} rhythm of <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> notes, or notes inégales, would sometimes simply override all the rules.

25|$|In the {{geometrical}} {{and physical}} settings, {{sometimes it is}} possible to associate, in a natural way, a length or magnitude and a direction to vectors. In addition, the notion of direction is strictly associated with the notion of an angle between two vectors. If <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> product of two vectors is defined — a scalar-valued product of two vectors —, then it's also possible to define a length; <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> product gives a convenient algebraic characterization of both angle (a function of <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> product between any two non-zero vectors) and length (the square root of <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> product of a vector by itself). In three dimensions, it is further possible to define the cross product, which supplies an algebraic characterization of the area and orientation in space of the parallelogram defined by two vectors (used as sides of the parallelogram). In any dimension (and, in particular, higher dimensions), it's possible to define the exterior product, which (among other things) supplies an algebraic characterization of the area and orientation in space of the n-dimensional parallelotope defined by n vectors.|$|E
