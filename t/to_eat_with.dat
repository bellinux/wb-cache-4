5|$|Mellitus {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates {{that one reason}} for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> the Roman missionaries.|$|E
5|$|South east of {{the keep}} was the hall, built by Roger Clifford in the late 14th century as a {{replacement}} for an earlier hall. It provided space for the castle's garrison, swelled by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, and was a location for the lord <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> his soldiers. The hall had large windows which may have detracted from the building's defensive capability, although it has been postulated that casements bore large wooden shutters. The kitchen, which served the entire castle, was set in the south-east corner of the fortification. Along the south wall were arranged more lodgings, a well, and a chapel, the latter another addition by Roger Clifford. In the south-west corner of the castle was the Tower of League, built around 1300 by Roger Clifford. It included further rooms for accommodation, but notably would also have allowed defenders to fire on an enemy emerging from the gatehouse. Four storeys tall and with a single room at each level, the presence of a garderobe and fireplace on each floor suggests that the tower was reserved for high-status visitors. The tower's square plan is typical of such structures built in northern England at this time, as seen at castles such as Warkworth and Egremont, although it contrasts with rounded towers preferred in the south.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, it was {{announced}} that Clarett would be changing prisons to a close-security prison in a single person cell at Toledo Correctional Institution, where he was able <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> and exercise with other inmates.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to explore whether motivational procedures are needed to maintain a retardate's continued use of previously trained eating skills. A profoundly retarded child who <b>ate</b> food <b>with</b> her hands was trained by a manual guidance procedure <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> properly <b>with</b> a spoon, but the child still did not use the spoon after having learned to do so. When a motivational-maintenance procedure was applied, the child did begin <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> properly. When maintenance was discontinued, the child returned <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>with</b> her hands. Proper eating returned when maintenance was applied again; when discontinued, the child returned <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>with</b> her hands. These results demonstrate that continued motivational procedures are needed after training to maintain the retardate's continued use of proper eating skills...|$|R

25|$|The {{allegory of}} the long spoons is a parable that shows the {{difference}} between heaven and hell by means of people forced <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> long spoons. It is attributed to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok, {{as well as other}} sources.|$|E
25|$|Rover was {{sometimes}} {{brought into the}} studio to assist with advertisements for Pal dog food.

25|$|The Vedic texts neither {{mention the}} concept of {{untouchable}} people nor any practice of untouchability.

25|$|The {{mention of}} the son's longing <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> the swine in Luke 15:16 could refer to how the Pharisees viewed the sinners (and Christ, for eating with them) in Luke 15:2. The Pharisees, caught up in their ideas of ritual cleanliness, might have thought of these people as filthy pigs.|$|E

25|$|The {{first group}} of prisoners was treated {{reasonably}} well under the circumstances, despite the inadequacy of the grounds, barracks, and sewer and water systems. Sewers were not authorized until June 1863 for the camp, and took time to be completed. Initially the prisoners received enough <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> <b>with</b> cooking stoves and utensils to aid in preparation, and clothing. A good sutler store was set up.|$|E

25|$|A {{sample survey}} in 2014, {{conducted}} by Dalit Adhikar Abhiyan {{and funded by}} ActionAid, found that among state schools in Madhya Pradesh, 88 per cent discriminated against Dalit children. In 79 per cent of the schools studied, Dalit children are forbidden from touching mid-day meals. They are required to sit separately at lunch in 35 per cent of schools, and are required <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> specially-marked plates in 28 per cent.|$|E
25|$|According to John Dominic Crossan, Jesus {{sent his}} disciples out to heal and to {{proclaim}} the Kingdom of God. They were <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> those they healed {{rather than with}} higher status people who might well be honored to host a healer, and Jesus directed them to eat whatever was offered them. This implicit challenge to the social hierarchy was part of Jesus' program of radical egalitarianism. These themes of healing and eating are common in early Christian art.|$|E
25|$|His simple origins {{became clear}} right after his election, when {{he wore a}} {{pectoral}} cross made of gilded metal {{on the day of}} his coronation and when his entourage was horrified, the new pope complained that he always wore it and that he had brought no other with him. He was well known for cutting down on papal ceremonies. He also abolished the custom of the pope dining alone, which had been established by Pope Urban VIII, and invited his friends <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E

25|$|Stó:lō {{society was}} {{organized}} into classes: the sí:yá:m (or upper classes), the ordinary people, and the slaves, who were usually captives taken from enemy tribes in raids or warfare. A person's family status {{was important in}} determining their role within Stó:lō society, and within Longhouse ceremonies, though this has faded over time. Slaves may have been treated relatively well, {{but they were not}} permitted <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> others at the Longhouse fire. They were primarily responsible for daily tasks such as gathering nuts, fruits and other foods, or firewood. The use of slaves died out in the nineteenth century. In some bands, the memory of which families descend from slaves may persist.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2012, John McAreavey {{said he was}} handcuffed {{by police}} {{officers}} and they examined his body for marks. He also {{saw one of the}} accused (Avinash Treebhoowoon) on two occasions within a number of minutes the day his wife died. McAreavey said that he had gone back to the hotel room looking for his wife when she failed to return to the restaurant after leaving him to get some biscuits from their room <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> their cups of tea. He found her unconscious in the bath, with the tap running and laid her on the floor and then tried to revive her. The DNA test made by a forensic expert from England revealed that no DNA traces of the two men accused and the other two original suspects were found on Michaela McAreavey body and at the crime scene except the DNA of John McAreavey.|$|E

500|$|Ryan White {{attended}} Western Middle School for {{eighth grade}} {{for the entire}} 1986–87 school year, but was deeply unhappy and had few friends. The school required him <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> disposable utensils, use separate bathrooms, and waived his requirement to enroll in a gym class. Threats continued. When a bullet was fired through the White's living room window (no one was home at the time), the family decided to leave Kokomo. After finishing the school year, {{his family moved to}} Cicero, Indiana, where the school district required him to enroll at Hamilton Heights High School, located in Arcadia, Indiana. On August 31, 1987, a [...] "very nervous" [...] Ryan White was greeted by school principal Tony Cook, school system superintendent Bob G.

500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at two in the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E
