5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed <b>the</b> <b>Truman</b> administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried <b>the</b> <b>Truman</b> administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, <b>the</b> <b>Truman</b> administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the Marshall Plan, Kennan and <b>the</b> <b>Truman</b> administration {{hoped that the}} Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies in Eastern Europe.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the 1948 - 1952 White House renovation, the State Dining Room color was changed, and <b>the</b> <b>Trumans</b> wanted a new china service to match the color of the soft celadon green walls. <b>The</b> <b>Trumans</b> ordered 1,572 pieces of Lenox china in 1951. The pattern {{included}} a border of celadon green flanked by an etched gold band and a twenty-four karat gold rim on an ivory body. It included a raised gold presidential seal, surrounded by 48 gold stars. Following the end of World War II, Harry Truman had issued an executive order in 1945 to standardize the seal; he had the head of the eagle turned toward the olive branch, representing peace, instead of toward the arrows, representing war. The china adhered to Truman's order. The service was first used on April 3, 1952, at a luncheon for the Dutch royal family.|$|R

5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of <b>the</b> <b>Truman</b> administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{changes in}} {{political}} leadership {{on both sides}} shifted the dynamic of the Cold War. Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January.

5|$|The administration's new vigorously anti-Soviet policy {{also became}} evident when, at Kennan's suggestion, the U.S. changed its hostility to Francisco Franco's anti-communists regime in Spain {{in order to}} secure U.S. {{influence}} in the Mediterranean.
