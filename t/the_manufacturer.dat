40|$|The {{introduction}} of independent retailers {{has long been}} recognized as a buffer that alleviates the price competition between channels. In this paper, we argue that this effect may be counter-balanced if <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> compete along dimensions that differ from prices (such as advertising). We find that delegating to retailers may intensify other non-price competition between <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and therefore make <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> worse off. Our analysis shows that the "retailer buffer" may be a two-edged sword and thus suggests that channel structure may critically depend on the specific dimensions along which <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> compete with each other. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R
