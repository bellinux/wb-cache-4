5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition into <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> system.|$|E

30|$|Some {{opposition}} to a universal approach seems to arise from a concern that it would inevitably be implemented by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> are highly ineffective, particularly for disadvantaged children. The relative effectiveness of <b>public</b> and private <b>schools</b> has been long debated, but evidence suggests at best small advantages of private education for achievement (Lubienski, Weitzel, & Lubienski, 2009; Peterson, 2008; Rouse & Barrow, 2009). In the preschool realm where much more of the provision is outside <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools,</b> comparisons of program quality and impacts on children’s learning and development favor <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> over private programs or Head Start (Barnett, 2008). However, private providers have delivered public preschool education to a high standard {{on a large scale}} in collaboration with <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R
50|$|Indianola Academy, {{a private}} school and former {{segregation}} academy, is in Indianola. As of 2012 most white teenagers in Indianola attend Indianola Academy instead of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> high <b>schools.</b> Sarah Carr of The Atlantic explained {{that there are two}} explanations of why the private academies in Indianola and other towns still exist. One says that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> suffered from poor leadership and wrongdoing and that the private academies thrive because of the failings of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools,</b> and <b>the</b> other says that the white leadership starved <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> of resources after the academies were enacted, leading to the failings of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools.</b> There is one other private school, Restoration Ministries Christian Academy.|$|R
5|$|Baden-Powell invited {{boys from}} {{different}} social backgrounds to the camp, a revolutionary idea during the class-conscious Edwardian era.

Seven came from the Boys' Brigade at Bournemouth, and three came from the Brigade at Poole & Hamworthy. Baden-Powell's nine-year-old nephew Donald Baden-Powell also attended. The camp fee was dependent on means: one pound for <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> boys, and three shillings and sixpence for the others.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{stint as}} {{president}} of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, where he pastored the First Presbyterian church of Lexington, Kentucky, and was appointed superintendent of public education by Governor William Owsley.

The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizes <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|E

5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> fund by drawing {{money from the}} state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund {{a survey of the}} state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it".|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, South Dakota has a total {{primary and}} {{secondary}} school enrollment of 136,872, with 120,278 of these students being educated in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> system. There are 703 public schools in 168 school districts, giving South Dakota {{the highest number of}} schools per capita in the United States. The current high school graduation rate is 89.9%, and the average ACT score is 21.8, slightly above the national average of 21.1. 89.8% of the adult population has earned at least a high school diploma, and 25.8% has earned a bachelor's degree or higher. South Dakota's 2008 average public school teacher salary of $36,674, compared to a national average of $52,308, was the lowest in the nation. In 2007 South Dakota passed legislation modeled after Montana's Indian Education for All Act (1999), mandating education about Native American tribal history, culture, and heritage in all the schools, from pre-school through college, in an effort to increase knowledge and appreciation about Indian culture among all residents of the state, as well as to reinforce Indian students' understanding of their own cultures' contributions.|$|E
