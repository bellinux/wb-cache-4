40|$|Fuji’ and ‘McIntosh’ {{apple trees}} (Malus x domestica Borkh.) on Geneva® 41 (G. 41), CG. 4013, CG. 5179, Geneva® 202 (G. 202), Geneva® 16 (G. 16) (N, liners from normal stool beds; T, liners from stool beds {{established}} with tissue cultured plants), M. 9 NAKBT 337, M. 26 EMLA, Supporter 1, Supporter 2, and Supporter 3 rootstocks were planted at several sites per cultivar throughout North America as a uniform trial coordinated by the NC- 140 Multi-State Research Committee. Partial plantings were established at two sites per cultivar. Geneva® 935 (G. 935) {{was included in}} two ‘Fuji’ and four ‘McIntosh’ plantings. After ten growing seasons, ‘Fuji’ mortality was greater than ‘McIntosh,’ and <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> M. 9 NAKBT 337 showed the greatest loss, with more than 35 % mortality. Tree size measurements of trunk cross-sectional area, tree height, and canopy spread were all affected by rootstock and were used to allocate each rootstock into one of four size categories. <b>Trees</b> <b>on</b> CG. 4013 were semidwarfs, larger than those on M. 26 EMLA. <b>Trees</b> <b>on</b> G. 202 and G. 935 were large dwarfs, similar in size to M. 26 EMLA. <b>Trees</b> <b>on</b> CG. 5179, G. 41, G. 16 N, and G. 16 T were moderate dwarfs, between <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> M. 26 EMLA and M. 9 NAKBT 337 and likely similar to the larger M. 9 clones. <b>Trees</b> <b>on</b> Supporter 1, Supporter 2, and Supporter 3 were small dwarfs, similar in size to <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> M. 9 NAKBT 337. Burr knot development was reasonably low but affected the greatest portion of the rootstock shank’s circumference of both ‘Fuji’ and ‘McIntosh’ <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> CG. 5179, G. 16 N, and G. 16 T. Root suckering was greatest from ‘Fuji’ <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> CG. 4013, CG. 5179, G. 202, and M. 9 NAKBT 337. Very little root suckering was seen with ‘McIntosh,’ but the greatest numbers were from <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> CG. 4013, CG. 5179, and M. 9 NAKBT 337. Cumulative yield per tree {{was positively related to}} tree size. The most yield efficient ‘Fuji’ <b>trees</b> were <b>on</b> CG. 5179, G. 41, and Supporter 1, and the least efficient were on M. 26 EMLA and CG. 4013. The most yield efficient ‘McIntosh’ <b>trees</b> were <b>on</b> Supporter 1, Supporter 2, Supporter 3, G. 41, and CG. 5179, and the least efficient were on G. 202, M. 26 EMLA, and CG. 4013. Average fruit weight was only modestly affected by rootstock. Generally, <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> G. 41, M. 9 NAKBT 337, and M. 26 EMLA had the largest fruit size, while <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> Supporter 2 and Supporter 3 had the smallest fruit size...|$|R

5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> his chest and back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters {{a little boy with}} a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E

40|$|In Rwanda, <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> {{farms are}} widely {{recognized}} for increasing and diversifying farm productivity while releasing pressure on existing forests. However, {{the motivation of}} rural households to plant <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> farms is often unclear. This study evaluates rural households demographic and socio-economic characteristics, {{as well as their}} attitudes, that influence the presence of <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> farms. Data used in this study were collected from a survey of 480 households across three altitude regions of Rwanda. Binary logistic regression analysis using PASW Statistics was applied to determine relevant predictor variables for the presence of <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> farms. The results show regional variation in explaining the presence of <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> farms. When data from the three regions were analysed together, significant predictor variables comprise the gender of head of the household, the number of salaried members of the households, the amount of farm fuelwood, the number of meals per day, the geographical location of the households and the selling of tree products. The presence of different <b>tree</b> species <b>on</b> farms was driven by economic factors, of which availability of food, firewood, and poles, and total income were most common. The results of the study imply that policy measures that target food security and income diversification in rural areas may, at the same time, enhance tree planting. Moreover, it is concluded that rural development and extension in agriculture should be site specific, to account for biophysical conditions and specific rural household motivations to plant <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> farms...|$|R

5|$|After 1995 the white-red-white flag {{is used as}} {{a symbol}} of the {{opposition}} to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, most notably at the protests after the 2006 and 2010 presidential elections and at mass rallies on Freedom Day celebrations as well as Dziady memorial marches. The flag is not officially banned from public usage, but is treated by the authorities as an unregistered symbol which means that demonstration of it by political activists or sports fans can lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags. In early 2010, the political activist Siarhei Kavalenka was arrested for placing the white-red-white flag atop a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> the central square of Vitsebsk. The court gave Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which was followed by a second arrest and Kavalenka's several weeks long hunger strike. The hunger strike was interrupted by force-feeding on 16 January 2012.|$|E

His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain.

5|$|After {{performances}} in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand in March/April 2006, the Rolling Stones tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe; during this break Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall from a <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> Fiji, {{where he had}} been on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006 it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his programme of rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Two out of the 21 shows scheduled for July–September 2006 were later cancelled due to Mick Jagger's throat problems. The Rolling Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest grossing tour of all time.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several countries along its path, Waka left {{the most significant}} losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, {{and much of the}} nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185km/h (115mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population {{due to the lack of}} fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33years.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places the cherry <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> {{top of the hill}} under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E
