In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E

This article examines the issues and challenges involved in developing a standardized optical network control plane. The control of optical <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> is decomposed into provisioning models, a circuit provisioning process based on signaling, a neighbor and service discovery process, and a topology and resource discovery process. Unique properties and challenges of optical <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> are explained {{in the context of}} these functions...|$|R
5|$|The UERL {{became part}} of London Transport in 1933, but the focus {{remained}} on high quality design. Under Pick, Holden's attention to detail and idea of integrated design extended to all parts of London's <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> from designing bus and tram shelters to {{a new type of}} six-wheeled omnibus. In the late 1930s, Holden designed replacement stations at Highgate, East Finchley and Finchley Central and new stations at Elstree South and Bushey Heath for the Northern line's Northern Heights plan. Holden's designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations: Dick Whittington for Highgate, a Roman centurion at Elstree South and an archer for East Finchley. Much of the project was postponed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was later cancelled. Only East Finchley station was completed in full with Highgate in part; the other plans were scrapped. East Finchley station is located on an embankment and the platforms are accessed from below. Making use of the station's air-rights, Holden provided staff office space spanning above the tracks accessed through semi-circular glazed stairways from the platforms. Eric Aumonier provided the statue The Archer, a prominent feature of the station.|$|E
5|$|The London Transport Museum is in a Victorian {{iron and}} glass {{building}} {{on the east side}} of the market square. It was designed as a dedicated flower market by William Rogers of William Cubitt and Company in 1871, and was first occupied by the museum in 1980. Previously the transport collection had been held at Syon Park and Clapham. The first parts of the collection were brought together at the beginning of the 20th century by the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) when it began to preserve buses being retired from service. After the LGOC was taken over by the London Electric Railway (LER), the collection was expanded to include rail vehicles. It continued to expand after the LER became part of the London Passenger Transport Board in the 1930s and as the organisation passed through various successor bodies up to TfL, London's transport authority since 2000. The Covent Garden building has on display many examples of buses, trams, trolleybuses and rail vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> has had on the city and its population.|$|E

40|$|Under urbanisation, {{transport}} infrastructures may {{be improved}} when urban population grows. Meanwhile, land use patterns may vary and this urban dynamics may drive variations in mode choice of commuters and spatial features of <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> Empirical studies have observed scaling laws between {{the amount of}} transport infrastructures and city sizes. This thesis is aiming to provide a modelling framework for the analytical investigation of network growth and present some empirical observations of the variation in spatial features of <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> First, a simple linear monocentric city model is formulated and the global performance of transport systems is derived. Two cases according to strategies of urban intensification and sprawl have been studied to examine the consequence of the scaling-law growth in transport infrastructures. Second, this thesis proposes a modelling framework. The framework includes two congestible modes, the scaling-law growth of transport infrastructures and housing allocation of residents so that phenomena under urban dynamics could be modelled. The experiments show that the proposed modelling framework could investigate the trade-off of investment on the highway and public transport system. Third, empirical observations of spatial features in <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> are reported in this thesis. The thesis measures circuity of <b>transport</b> <b>networks,</b> because this indicator could examine how aggregate <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> are and the efficiency of network structures. Then research methods that can deal with several data sources are developed. The empirical observation shows that there is an exponential decay between the circuity and travel time in public <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> Meanwhile, this thesis also presents that the average circuity in road networks is less than that in public <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> for the same sample of trips, which to some extent show the difference of spatial features between road and public <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> Additionally, correlations between circuity, accessibility and mode share are analysed...|$|R
40|$|Human {{mobility}} {{has played}} a major role in the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) through transportation; however, its pattern and mechanism have remained unclear. This study used <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> as a proxy for human mobility to generate the spatial process of TB incidence. It examined the association between TB incidence and four types of <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> at the provincial level: provincial roads, national roads, highways, and railways. Geographical information systems and geospatial analysis were used to examine the spatial distribution of 2217 smear-positive TB cases reported between 2009 and 2011 in the Shandong province. The study involved factors such as population density and elevation difference in conjunction with the types of <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> to predict the disease occurrence in space. It identified spatial clusters of TB incidence linked not only with <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> of the regions but also differentiated by elevation. Our research findings provide evidence of targeting populous regions with well-connected <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> for effective surveillance and control of TB transmission in Shandong.
