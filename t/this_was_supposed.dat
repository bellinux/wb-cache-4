5|$|During the evening, the 14th RWF {{launched}} a minor trench raid. On 8 July, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> {{to develop into}} {{an attack on the}} southern tip of the wood. While the division prepared to launch a battalion-sized attack, XV Corps commander Lieutenant General Henry Horne ordered a smaller attack by a platoon. The day was spent in confusion; conflicting orders were issued and Horne travelled to the division to clarify his intentions. In the end, no attack was launched.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} Cold War, NATO's watch {{against the}} Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not {{actually}} lead to direct military action. On 1July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until {{a decision was made}} to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.|$|E

25|$|Hershey is {{introducing}} new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots {{for the upcoming}} Easter season.

25|$|This episode's {{original}} ending {{involved the}} Doctor, following {{the final scene}} where he is alone in the TARDIS, being alerted to something on the monitor and as he checks two Cybermen rise up behind him. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to lead directly into The Next Doctor, but Davies was convinced by Benjamin Cook (who was corresponding with Davies for the book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale) to drop the scene, as he felt that a cliffhanger was not appropriate after such a sad ending.|$|E

25|$|His first short {{stop was}} at a Greek airport. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be {{a stop on the}} way to Stockholm. Instead of Stockholm he was {{transferred}} to Russia. Russia did not grant him sanctuary. On November 14, 1999, Öcalan arrived in Rome, Italy accompanied by Ramon Mantovani, a member of the Communist Refoundation Party, from Moscow. His arrival was a surprise to the Italian government, which had not been notified, and an international crisis began as Turkey requested Öcalan's extradition.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tradition}} derived {{the date}} of Christmas {{from that of the}} Annunciation, the virginal conception of Jesus. Since <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to have taken place on 14 Nisan in the Jewish calendar, calculated to have been either 25 March or 6 April, it was believed that {{the date of}} Christ's birth will have been nine months later. A tractate falsely attributed to John Chrysostom argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as 25 March, a computation also mentioned by Saint Augustine of Hippo.|$|E

25|$|Aware that Sherman's army {{moving through}} North Carolina might combine with Grant's army at Petersburg if General Joseph E. Johnston's army {{could not stop}} Sherman, and that Lee's own declining army could not hold the Richmond and Petersburg {{defenses}} much longer, in March 1865, General Lee accepted a plan by Major General John Brown Gordon to launch an attack on Union Fort Stedman. The objective would be to break the Union lines east of Petersburg, {{or at least to}} compel the Union forces to shorten their lines by gaining ground in a substantial attack. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to permit Lee to shorten the Confederate lines and send a substantial force to help Johnston, or if necessary to give the Confederates a head start in evacuating Richmond and Petersburg and combining Lee's entire force with Johnston's dwindling army.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{plans for}} the 1995 Triplemanía III series of events {{included}} a storyline where Los Gringos Locos members Eddy Guerrero and Art Barr would turn on team mate Konnan {{in the fall of}} 1994. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to turn técnico and set up a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, between Konnan and Art Barr where both would put their hair on the line. AAA booker Antonio Peña was hoping to actually sell out the 130,000 seat Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The plans never came to fruition as Art Barr died suddenly on November 23, 1994 before the storyline even had a chance to start. Barr's death, coupled with the Mexican peso crisis in 1994 led to Guerrero leaving AAA to work in the United States instead and thus made a Los Gringos Locos storyline impossible to piece together. AAA still planned on making the 1995 Triplemanía III event a series of shows, spread out over several weeks, serving as the Super Bowl of AAA's year.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} that Philip was {{suspected}} of a tendency toward Zwinglianism. His sympathy for the Reformers associated with Zwingli in Switzerland and Bucer in Strasburg was intensified by the anger of the emperor at receiving from Philip a statement of Protestant tenets composed by the ex-Franciscan Lambert, and the landgrave's failure to secure any common action {{on the part of}} the Protestant powers regarding the approaching Turkish war. Philip eagerly embraced Zwingli's plan of a great Protestant alliance to extend from the Adriatic to Denmark to keep the Holy Roman Emperor from crossing into Germany. This association caused some coldness between himself and the followers of Luther at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, especially when he propounded his irenic policy to Melanchthon and urged that all Protestants should stand together in demanding that a general council alone should decide religious differences. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be indicative of Zwinglianism, and Philip soon found it necessary to explain his exact position on the question of the Eucharist, whereupon he declared that he fully agreed with the Lutherans, but disapproved of persecuting the Swiss.|$|E

500|$|Even {{with this}} clause removed, the team {{could not afford}} to redevelop Plough Lane when {{required}} to do so the following year. Wimbledon moved about [...] across south London {{before the start of the}} 1991–92 season to share Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park ground. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be a temporary arrangement while Wimbledon arranged the construction of their own new ground in a more local area, but the move was still unpopular among fans. Critics alleged that it was at least partly motivated by financial considerations, particularly the profit that might be gained from selling the old ground. The respective Wimbledon and Crystal Palace reserve teams groundshared at Plough Lane after the Wimbledon first team left.|$|E
500|$|Wimbledon rose {{through the}} {{professional}} divisions unusually rapidly {{in what has been}} called a [...] "fairytale", {{and by the end of}} the 1980s were playing at the top of the English game. In 1991, after the Taylor Report ordered the redevelopment of English football grounds, the team entered a groundshare at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park stadium, about [...] east of Plough Lane. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be a temporary arrangement while the Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam sought a new stadium site in south-west London, but this search proved frustratingly long, both for Hammam and the club's fans. Much to the anger of most Wimbledon supporters, Hammam proposed new locations for the team outside London, including the Irish capital Dublin. He sold the club to two Norwegian businessmen, Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten, in 1997 and the following year sold Plough Lane for a supermarket redevelopment.|$|E

He became involved with politics as well, joining the groups of Miguel de Azcuénaga and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña. Those groups sought to generate great political and social changes, and would lead to the May Revolution. He was selected {{to take part in the}} open cabildo celebrated on 22 May to decide the fate of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, as well as other twenty-seven ecclesiastics. He was among the nineteen that voted for the removal of the viceroy, supporting the proposal of Cornelio Saavedra.

Planché also participated in state ceremonial within England; in 1856 he and other officers of arms proclaimed peace following the conclusion of the Crimean War. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to take place [...] "according to precedent", but the 'stage management' of the event left something to be desired; among other things the gates at Temple Bar, where the officers of arms customarily demand entry to the City of London, were left open.|$|E
