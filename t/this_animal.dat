5|$|All {{but one of}} {{the major}} iguana {{concentrations}} are either partially or fully protected by the Cuban government. Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas (the National Center for Protected Areas) has suggested it will explore this route in the future. In 1985 the Cuban government issued a commemorative peso depicting a Cuban iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for <b>this</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Common {{trees are}} oaks, willows and alders, which {{tolerate}} wet soils. Because the phreatic table {{is very close}} to the surface, soils hardly freeze in winter and drought rarely occurs in summer. The nature reserve also has meadows and reed beds. Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve is home to the largest fallow deer population in France. <b>This</b> <b>animal</b> was introduced to the area in 1854.|$|E
5|$|In December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale {{appeared in the}} Firth of Tay off the shore of Dundee, at that time Scotland's major whaling port, and attracted much local interest. The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic, but as the whaling boats were in harbour for the winter, some of the whalers decided to hunt <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> in their own waters.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>animal's</b> {{height is}} said to be {{approximately}} 1 m (3 feet).|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>animal's</b> {{habitat is}} dry, open {{eucalypt}} forests and grassy woodlands at altitudes between sea level and 1,000 meters.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>animal's</b> {{specific}} epithet, delcourti, {{is taken}} from the surname of French museum worker Alain Delcourt, who discovered the forgotten specimen {{in the basement of}} the Natural History Museum of Marseille.|$|R
5|$|The Utila iguana has a grey-brown {{to black}} {{coloring}} when young, the only species of spiny-tail iguana {{with such a}} dark color when young. Other members of the genus have a green or yellow coloring when young and turn darker with age. As <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> matures {{it can be a}} blue or light gray in color, depending on heat conditions or even the animal's temper.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{specimen}} {{was obtained by}} W.G. Palmer in 1904 and the next year, Oldfield Thomas of the British Museum of Natural History described <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> as the holotype of a new species he named Nectomys dimidiatus. He placed it in the genus Nectomys, commenting that it was much smaller than but otherwise similar to previously known members of that genus. The species was listed as a Nectomys in taxonomic overviews in the next decades, including a 1944 review of the genus by Philip Hershkovitz.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a more thorough}} analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida. They mentioned {{the condition of the}} hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of Ambondro, by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the distal metacristid. In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.|$|E
5000|$|Illicit {{smuggling}} for the pet {{trade is}} another {{area in which}} <b>this</b> <b>animal's</b> population has been harmed. [...] In April 1994, photographs of this subspecies appeared in pictures of Florida reptile wholesalers' inventory in a magazine article.|$|R
50|$|Because of <b>this</b> <b>animals</b> {{size and}} stealthiness, the range {{in which they}} occur is not {{completely}} known. Although, {{it has been documented}} that they prefer locations that are easy for them to hide in that are also near rivers.|$|R
5000|$|Their unusual {{displays}} involve drumming noises from inflatable throat sacs, head throwing, and erecting short crests. Plumage sequences are complicated, {{and aging}} difficult. Plumage {{is vital for}} survival because of <b>this</b> <b>animals</b> tendency {{to spend time in}} the water.|$|R
5|$|The primary {{wildlife}} reservoirs for Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, woodrats, and mice. Opossums {{are particularly}} important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> without having to re-enter the insect vector. Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3% to 37.5%.|$|E
5|$|The right whales' two known predators are {{humans and}} orcas. When danger lurks, {{a group of}} right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which {{sometimes}} proves to be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, {{the sheer size of}} <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> is its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.|$|E
5|$|The shark tourist {{industry}} has some financial leverage in conserving <b>this</b> <b>animal.</b> A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000. That is {{a fraction of}} the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between £50 and £150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.|$|E
50|$|A {{well-known}} {{example of}} zoopharmacognosy occurs when dogs eat grass to induce vomiting. However, the behaviour is more diverse than <b>this.</b> <b>Animals</b> ingest or apply non-foods such as clay, charcoal and even toxic plants and invertebrates, apparently to prevent parasitic infestation or poisoning.|$|R
40|$|Alpaca {{breeding}} is {{an important}} animal resource {{for the people who}} lives in the andean high plateau of the north of Chile, <b>this</b> <b>animals</b> are well adapted to the extreme conditions of the high altitude grasslands. In the last six year exist an increasing interest for breeding <b>this</b> <b>animals</b> in the dry low lands of the central and south region of Chile. The aim of this work is to show the principal results of the observation and management of a 140 alpaca herd maintained during 5 years in the central zone of Chile. Monthly discussion of the productive, reproductive and sanitary management is given in order to contribute with the knowledge of the alpaca breeding in a zone with different characteristics to the altiplano. ...|$|R
50|$|Melbourne Zoo is Australia's oldest zoo and {{was modeled}} on London Zoo. The zoo was opened on 6 October 1862 at the Royal Park site of 55 acre on land {{donated by the}} City of Melbourne. Before <b>this,</b> <b>animals</b> were housed at the botanical gardens in Melbourne.|$|R
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|During a 2003 {{biological}} {{inventory of}} the Mikea Forest, a forest region of southwestern Madagascar, a single specimen of the rodent genus Macrotarsomys was collected. <b>This</b> <b>animal</b> {{turned out to be}} distinct from both previously known species of the genus—bastard big-footed mouse, which is widespread in western Madagascar, and the larger greater big-footed mouse, known only from the Ankarafantsika National Park. Accordingly, Steven Goodman and Voahangy Soarimalala named it in 2005 as a new species, Macrotarsomys petteri. The specific name, petteri, honors French zoologist Francis Petter for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents. Petter's big-footed mouse, the largest species in the genus, is most similar to greater big-footed mouse, which may be its closest relative.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{are used}} in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The {{traditional}} Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. <b>This</b> <b>animal</b> is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.|$|E
50|$|Takin attract {{attention}} {{due to their}} unusual appearance; taxonomists were originally uncertain of <b>this</b> <b>animal's</b> phylogeny and many people describe it as a “bee-stung moose”. Bhutan takin (Budorcas taxicolor whitei) is listed as a vulnerable species of goat-antelope, native to Bhutan, India and the People's Republic of China.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} {{pocket gopher}} is plentiful in suitable habitat {{over most of}} its range although some populations are small and may come and go. The population trend is unknown but no specific threats have been identified and the IUCN has listed <b>this</b> <b>animal's</b> conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
40|$|There {{is now a}} {{considerable}} literature on the brain and behaviour of Octopus (for reviews see Wells, 1966; Young, 1964).

These experi...|$|R
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. <b>This</b> <b>animal</b> competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E
5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. <b>This</b> <b>animal</b> is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Diplodocus were {{described}} between 1878 and 1924. The first skeleton {{was found at}} Cañon City, Colorado, by Benjamin Mudge and Samuel Wendell Williston in 1877, and was named Diplodocus longus ('long double-beam'), by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878. Although not the type species, D. carnegii is the most completely known and most famous species due to {{the large number of}} casts of its skeleton in museums around the world. Diplodocus remains have since been found in the Morrison Formation of the western U.S. States of Colorado, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Fossils of <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> are common, except for the skull, which has never been found with otherwise complete skeletons. D. hayi, known from a partial skeleton and skull discovered by William H. Utterback in 1902 near Sheridan, Wyoming, was described in 1924. In 2015, it was renamed as the separate genus Galeamopus, and several other Diplodocus specimens were referred to that genus, leaving no definite Diplodocus skulls known.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, paleontologists Jorge Orlando Calvo and José Fernando Bonaparte named Andesaurus, {{which refers}} to the Andes and also {{includes}} the Greek word sauros ("lizard"), because of the proximity of <b>this</b> <b>animal's</b> remains to the Andes. Andesaurus fossils were found by Alejandro Delgado, after whom the single known species (A. delgadoi) is named.|$|R

25|$|Native {{peoples and}} early {{settlers}} also ate <b>this</b> <b>animal's</b> meat. Through trap and transfer and habitat conservation, beavers made a nearly complete recovery by the 1940s. The current beaver {{population has been}} estimated to be 10 to 15 million; one estimate claims that there may at one time have been as many as 90 million.|$|R
5|$|The {{elongation}} of {{the neck}} appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest that vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15mya or 18–14.3mya and whose deposits {{have been found in}} Libya. <b>This</b> <b>animal</b> was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. Giraffokeryx appeared 15mya in the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones. Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remains of}} tyrannosaurids were {{uncovered}} during expeditions {{led by the}} Geological Survey of Canada, which located numerous scattered teeth. These distinctive dinosaur teeth were given the name Deinodon ("terrible tooth") by Joseph Leidy in 1856. The first good specimens of a tyrannosaurid {{were found in the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, and consisted of nearly complete skulls with partial skeletons. These remains were first studied by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876, who considered them a species of the eastern tyrannosauroid Dryptosaurus. In 1905, Henry Fairfield Osborn recognized that the Alberta remains differed considerably from Dryptosaurus, and coined a new name for them: Albertosaurus sarcophagus ("flesh-eating Alberta lizard"). Cope described more tyrannosaur material in 1892, in the form of isolated vertebrae, and gave <b>this</b> <b>animal</b> the name Manospondylus gigas. This discovery was mostly overlooked for over a century, and caused controversy in the early 2000s when it was discovered that this material actually belonged to, and had name priority over, Tyrannosaurus rex.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} the blue-tailed ground lizard are predation and habitat loss. The species only occurs across the dry forests of southwestern Puerto Rico; accordingly, this habitat specialist requires very hot and dry climates to metabolize food and remain active throughout the day. Introduced mammals including small cats and mongooses affect <b>this</b> <b>animal's</b> populations.|$|R
50|$|Tropotaxis is {{displayed}} by organisms with paired receptor cells. When the stimuli {{coming from a}} source are balanced equally the organisms show movement. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>animals</b> are able to move sideways, unlike klinotaxis where the organisms can move only in a straight line. The movement of grayling butterflies and fish lice clearly demonstrates tropotaxis.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>this</b> <b>animal's</b> {{remains were}} first {{mentioned}} in print in 1959, {{it was not}} named until the description written by Brazilian paleontologists Rodrigo Santucci and Reinaldo Bertini in 2006. It was the first dinosaur named in that year. The type specimen, the only material known of the genus, consists of the second through seventh caudal vertebrae and two chevrons.|$|R
