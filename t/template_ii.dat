40|$|Motivation: Biological {{pathways}} provide significant {{insights on}} the interaction mechanisms of molecules. Presently, many essential pathways still remain unknown or incomplete for newly sequenced organisms. Moreover, experimental validation of enormous numbers of possible pathway candidates in a wet-lab environment is time-and effort-extensive. Thus, {{there is a}} need for comparative genomics tools that help scientists predict pathways in an organism’s biological network. Results: In this article, we propose a technique to discover unknown pathways in organisms. Our approach makes in-depth use of Gene Ontology (GO) -based functionalities of enzymes involved in meta-bolic pathways as follows: (i) Model each pathway as a biological functionality graph of enzyme GO functions, which we call pathway functionality <b>template.</b> (<b>ii)</b> Locate frequent pathway functionality patterns so as to infer previously unknown pathways through pattern matching in meta-bolic networks of organisms. We have experimentally evaluated the accuracy of the presented technique for 30 bacterial organisms to predict around 1500 organism-specific versions of 50 reference pathways. Using cross-validation strategy on known pathways, we have been able to infer pathways with 86 % precision and 72 % recall for enzymes (i. e. nodes). The accuracy of the predicted enzyme relationships has been measured at 85 % precision with 64 % recall. Availability: Code upon request...|$|E
40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} study white matter (WM) degeneration in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders. In order to compare diffusion measures across subjects in an automated way, voxel-based analysis (VBA) methods were introduced. In VBA, all DTI data are transformed to a template, after which the diffusion measures of control subjects and patients are compared quantitatively in each voxel. Although VBA has many advantages compared to other post-processing approaches, such as region of interest analysis or tractography, VBA results need to be interpreted cautiously, since it has been demonstrated that they depend on the different parameter settings that are applied in the VBA processing pipeline. In this paper, we {{examine the effect of}} the template selection on the VBA results of DTI data. We hypothesized that the choice of template to which all data are transformed would also affect the VBA results. To this end, simulated DTI data sets as well as DTI data from control subjects and multiple sclerosis patients were aligned to (i) a population-specific DTI <b>template,</b> (<b>ii)</b> a subject-based DTI atlas in MNI space, and (iii) the ICBM- 81 DTI atlas.

40|$|Principled {{syntactic}} code completion enables {{developers to}} change source code by inserting code templates, thus increasing developer efficiency and supporting language exploration. However, existing code completion systems are ad-hoc and neither complete nor sound. They are not complete and only provide few code templates for selected programming languages. They also are not sound and propose code templates that yield invalid programs when inserted. This paper presents a generic framework that automatically derives complete and sound syntactic code completion from the syntax definition of arbitrary languages. A key insight {{of our work}} is to provide an explicit syntactic representation for incomplete programs using placeholders. This enables us to address the following challenges for code completion separately: (i) completing incomplete programs by replacing placeholders with code <b>templates,</b> (<b>ii)</b> injecting placeholders into complete programs to make them incomplete, and (iii) introducing lexemes and placeholders into incorrect programs through error-recovery parsing to make them correct so we can apply one of the previous strategies.

40|$|Treatment {{of large}} and complex bone defects remains a {{significant}} clinical problem. Due to the defect size, the regeneration cannot rely on natural bone healing process for recovery. Traditional scaffold design supports bone formation through intramembranous ossification, which limits vascularization leading to graft core necrosis and poor bone formation. Functional long bones can be regenerated following a developmental engineering approach, {{which requires a}} transient hypertrophic-cartilage template that contains all necessary signals to initiate bone tissue formation, vascularization, remodeling, and establishment of a functional bone marrow. This dissertation will present {{the design of a}} hybrid matrix system consisting of a mechanically stable polymeric microsphere and a hyaluronan-fibrin hydrogel phase which will support the formation of hypertrophic-cartilage template. Thus, the specific aims of this thesis are (i) to design and fabricate Hyaluronan-Fibrin hydrogel phase that mimics the natural ECM and supports formation of hypertrophic-cartilage <b>template,</b> (<b>ii)</b> in vitro evaluation of polymer-hydrogel scaffold system’s potential for bone formation through endochondral ossification, and (iii) in vivo assessment of polymer-hydrogel scaffold system’s bone formation via endochondral ossification using a critical-calvarial mouse (NSG/Col 3. 6 Tpz) model. With the in vitro and animal studies, we concluded with confidence that the engineered hybrid matrix supported the formation of a rich hypertrophic-cartilage template and its subsequent mineralization.

Zirconium titanium oxides (25 : 75 mol %) with three different pore structures were synthesized in order to relate polymer loading capacity to macropore architecture. Sol−gel chemistry was used to prepare the materials in conjunction with (i) agarose gel <b>templating,</b> (<b>ii)</b> no <b>template,</b> and (iii) stearic acid templating. The three materials possessed high surface areas (212 − 316 m 2 g− 1). Surface modification was performed postsynthetically using propionic acid (a monomer), glutaric acid (a dimer), and three molecular weights of poly(acrylic acid) (2000, 100000, and 250000 g mol− 1). Higher loading (mg g− 1) was observed for the polymers than for the small molecules. Following surface modification, a perceptible decrease in surface area and mesopore volume was noted, but both mesoporosity and macroporosity were retained. The pore architecture had a strong bearing on the quantity and rate of polymer incorporation into metal oxides. The templated pellet with hierarchical porosity outperformed the nontemplated powder and the mesoporous monolith (in both loading capacity and surface coverage). The materials were subjected to irradiation with 60 Co γ-rays to determine the radiolytic stability of the inorganic support and the hybrid material containing the monomer, dimer, and polymer.

Using bioinformatic tools, we developed metabarcodes for several groups of organisms: fungi, bryophytes, enchytraeids, beetles and birds. The ability of these metabarcodes to amplify the target groups was systematically evaluated by (i) in silico PCRs using all standard sequences in the EMBL public database as <b>templates,</b> (<b>ii)</b> in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from surface soil samples from a site in Varanger, northern Norway and (iii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from permanently frozen sediment samples of late-Pleistocene age (∼ 16 000 - 50 000 years bp) from two Siberian sites, Duvanny Yar and Main River.

The initial focus on the pathological effects usually accompanying infection by viroids soon shiftedto their molecular features—they are circular molecules that fold upon themselves adopting compactsecondary conformations—and then to how they manipulate their hosts to be propagated. Replicationof viroids—in the nucleus or chloroplasts through a rolling-circle mechanism involving polymerization,cleavage and circularization of RNA strands—dealt three surprises: (i) certain RNA polymerases are redi-rected to accept RNA instead of their DNA <b>templates,</b> (<b>ii)</b> cleavage in chloroplastic viroids is not mediatedby host enzymes but by hammerhead ribozymes, and (iii) circularization in nuclear viroids is catalyzedby a DNA ligase redirected to act upon RNA substrates.

Various types of RNA-RNA crossovers were described including crosses between the same or different viral RNAs or between viral and cellular RNAs. Likewise, a variety of molecular mechanisms are known to support RNA recombination, such as replicative events (based on internal or end-to-end replicase switchings) along with nonreplicative joining among RNA fragments of viral and/or cellular origin. Such mechanisms as RNA decay or RNA interference are responsible for RNA fragmentation and trans-esterification reactions which are likely accountable for ligation of RNA fragments. Numerous host factors were found to affect the profiles of viral RNA recombinants and significant differences in recombination frequency were observed among various RNA viruses. Comparative analyses of viral sequences allowed for the development of evolutionary models in order to explain adaptive phenotypic changes and co-evolving sites. Many questions remain to be answered by forthcoming RNA recombination research.

In both cases the measured lag (t_cen) of Fe II is longer than that of H-beta, although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of Fe <b>II</b> <b>template</b> used in the fit. For spectral decompositions done using the Fe <b>II</b> <b>template</b> of Veron-Cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(Fe II) /t_cen(H-beta) = 1. 9 +- 0. 6 in NGC 4593 and 1. 5 +- 0. 3 in Mrk 1511. The detection of highly correlated variations between Fe II and continuum emission demonstrates that the Fe II emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, located predominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

30|$|Biometric hashing schemes {{are simple}} yet {{powerful}} biometric template protection methods [22 – 26]. Biohash is a binary and pseudo-random {{representation of a}} biometric template (e.g., face or fingerprint), and biometric hashing schemes perform an automatic verification of a user based on her biohash which is a binary string. The two inputs to a biometric hashing scheme are (i) biometric <b>template</b> and (<b>ii)</b> user specific secret key. A biometric feature vector is transformed into another space using a pseudo-random set of vectors which are generated from the user’s secret key. Then, the result is binarized to produce a pseudo-random bit string which is called the biohash. What is unique or specific to each user is the random projection matrix {{and it can be}} stored in a USB token or smartcard. In a practical system, user-specific random matrix is calculated based on a seed (user-specific secret key) that is stored in a USB token or smartcard microprocessor through a pseudo-random number generator. The seed is the same as those users recorded during the enrollment and is different among different users and different applications [7].|$|R
40|$|PCR {{analyses}} of ancient and degraded DNA suffer from their extreme sensitivity to contamination by modern DNA originating, in particular, from carryover contamination with previously amplified or cloned material. Any strategy for limiting carryover contamination {{would also have}} to be compatible with the particular requirements of ancient DNA analyses. These include the need (i) to amplify short PCR products due to <b>template</b> fragmentation; (<b>ii)</b> to clone PCR products in order to track possible base misincorporation resulting from damaged templates; and (iii) to avoid incomplete decontamination causing artifactual sequence transformation. Here we show that the enzymatic decontamination procedures based upon dUTP- and uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) can be adapted to meet the specific requirements of ancient DNA research. Thus, efficiency can be improved to vastly reduce the amplification of fragments < or = 100 bp. Secondly, the use of an Escherichia coli strain deficient in both UNG and dUTPase allows for the cloning of uracil-containing PCR products and offers protection from plasmid DNA contamination, and, lastly, PCR products amplified from UNG-degraded material are free of misleading sequence modifications...|$|R
