In {{the course of this}} research, we visited a number of schools that offer boarding opportunities to disadvantaged young people. We wish to thank those who invited us to visit and took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> about the important work they do. We want to express our appreciation to the educators, school founders, and children and youth services professionals who talked with us about the young people they work with and the challenges they face. Thanks also go to the families of children attending community boarding schools who took time to sit down and share with us their reasons for choosing this educational option. The thoughtful engagement of the members of our advisory committee contributed to the project in many ways, from spurring us to rethink our conceptua...|$|E
40|$|We wish {{to thank}} all those who generously agreed {{to be interviewed for}} this {{important}} project. Although we cannot name individuals and groups specifically, we were fortunate that 128 individuals took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Most especially, we want to thank the international and U. S. women who are survivors of trafficking and prostitution-many of whom are still in situations where they are exploited and have few resources-who consented to be interviewed. We thank also the dedicated social service providers, health workers, advocates, and law enforcement personnel who spoke with us. In the process of completing this work, several individuals worked tirelessly on this project as research assistants. We thank Lisa Przyuski, Nadine Mendelsohn, Kelly Brooks and Laura Joy Sporcic, all of whom did an immense amount of work during the course of two years. Finally, we acknowledge with gratitude the support of the National Institute of Justice who funded this project. We thank especially Dr. Leora Rosen who was both a source of clarity an...|$|E

25|$|One of the {{identified}} {{causes of the}} waste {{in the health care}} system is a lack of communication between doctors and patients. The decisions of physicians account for most of a patient's expenses, yet physicians work under various pressures including limited <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> patients and review their information. Patients sometimes make requests for treatment against their doctor's advice in cases where more effective choices would be made if doctors had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> consult expert medical opinion.|$|R

Also employed by the Marconi Company was David Sarnoff, who later headed RCA. Wireless communications were reportedly maintained for 72 hours between Carpathia and Sarnoff, but Sarnoff's involvement has been questioned by some modern historians.

60|$|Ten {{or twelve}} years later, Redpath was earning his living in Boston {{as chief of}} the lecture {{business}} in the United States. Fifteen or sixteen years after his Kansas adventures I became a public lecturer, and he was my agent. Along there somewhere was a press dinner, one November night, at the Tremont Hotel in Boston, and I attended it. I sat near {{the head of the}} table, with Redpath between me and the chairman; a stranger sat on my other side. I tried several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> the stranger, but he seemed to be out of words and I presently ceased from troubling him.

40|$|Children of {{all ages}} are {{affected}} by the death of a significant person in their lives. Two researchers, Renzo Vianello and Maria Lucamante, investigated the differences in how healthy and seriously ill children understand death. Their results “suggest that children, healthy or sick, are left alone with the problem of death and are not helped either by their parents or by their doctors ” (2001, p. 305). Young children usually base their idea of death on what they understand. Because young children’s cognitive abilities are still developing, it is critically important for adults <b>to</b> make the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> them about death with age-appropriate language. Infants also “experience feelings of loss ” (Walsh-Burke, 2006, p. 32). Upon separation from their primary caregiver, infants may cry inconsolably or be quiet and unresponsive...|$|R
60|$|Indeed I {{had little}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> Bes about such light matters, since things moved apace in Memphis. Within six days {{all the great}} lords left in Upper Egypt were sworn to the revolt under the {{leadership}} of Peroa, and hour by hour their vassals or hired mercenaries flowed into the city. These it was my duty to weld into an army, and at this task I toiled without cease, separating them into regiments and drilling them, also arranging for the arming and victualling of the boats of war. Then news came that Idernes was advancing from Sais with a great force of Easterns, all the garrison of Lower Egypt indeed, as his messengers said, to answer the summons conveyed to him under the private Seal of seals.|$|R
30|$|Other {{instructors}} described {{alternatives to}} confronting students or ways {{to lower the}} anxiety of responding when called on. Michelle assigned groups and seats for the entire semester so students {{get to know each}} other and are invested in others’ success, while Peter assigned project teams and had students discuss with their neighbors before asking for volunteers. Benjamin always called on teams instead of individuals. Tracey offered whiteboard markers to students who seem disengaged and invited them to work on the next step in group problem-solving. Esther and Peter found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> teams or individuals privately to understand why students are not participating and discuss the implications of non-participation. On the other hand, some instructors, like Justin and David, mentioned forgoing approaching non-participating students if they make it clear they do not want to participate after repeated attempts.|$|R

40|$|The current fault-based tort system {{assumes that}} claims made against {{physicians}} are {{inversely related to}} the quality of care they provide. In this study we identified physician characteristics associated with elements of medical care that make physicians vulnerable to malpractice claims. A sample of physicians (n = 248) thought to be at high or low risk for claims was surveyed on various personal and professional characteristics. Statistical analysis showed that 9 characteristics predicted risk group. High risk was associated with increased age, surgical specialty, emergency department coverage, increased days away from practice, and the feeling that the litigation climate was "unfair. " Low risk was associated <b>with</b> scheduling enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> patients, answering patients' telephone calls directly, feeling "satisfied" with practice arrangements, and acknowledging greater emotional distress. Prediction was more accurate for physicians in practice 15 years or less. We conclude that a relationship exists between a history of malpractice claims and selected physician characteristics...|$|R
500|$|Many {{accounts}} concerning Eystein {{in later}} sagas {{are characterized by}} literary motifs, and have little value as sources on his life. Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic author of the early 13th century Heimskringla mastered this literary style particularly well, stylistically and psychologically. His stories includes a so-called mannjevning (literally [...] "comparison of men") between Eystein and Sigurd, {{in which the two}} boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other. In a similar fashion, Snorri also tells a story about how Eystein managed to cure the melancholy of a friend, by agreeing <b>to</b> regularly clear <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> him about what troubled him. On his physical appearance, Snorri wrote that Eystein [...] "was the handsomest man that could be seen. He had blue open eyes; his hair yellow and curling; his stature not tall, but of the middle size." [...] More reliable information, particularly about Eystein's building-projects, is offered in earlier sagas such as the work of Theodoric the Monk, a Norwegian chronicler who wrote in the late 12th century.|$|R
30|$|In the ILS framework, {{the manner}} in which adults {{interact}} verbally with children and the social context in which children’s language interaction is stimulated are key. Low-anxiety social settings that afford opportunities for purposeful verbalizations and build upon the interests of the child facilitate language skill development most effectively, and this includes second language learners (Lessow-Hurley 2003). In addition, when adults properly extend or restate what children say, model and distinctly enunciate quality language, and intentionally make <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> children, the process of language acquisition is accelerated (Cornerstones 2009; Pence and Justice 2008). These interactions are most effective when they are directed toward the child’s current focus or interest (stimulus) and current level of language development with appropriate scaffolding in a risk-free informal setting (Owens 2008 b). In brief, for young language learners, it is preferable for teachers to more closely follow the child’s lead, limiting extensions of the child’s language by using indirect and less complex language stimulation techniques more closely matched to the child’s early language level (Tsybina et al. 2006).|$|R
