This hygroscopic trait can also prompt chemical reactions on a surface, especially upon metals. Inorganic dust particles may have tough sharp edges which can cause a number of types of damage from tearing fibers <b>to</b> <b>abrading</b> softer surfaces if not properly removed.

The three amino acids were {{translocated}} with similar velocities and mass transfer rates on a molar basis, {{although they were}} metabolized differently in the sink tissue. The concentration dependence of leucine translocation showed a triphasic saturation response, while sucrose translocation showed a biphasic saturation response to increasing concentration. Apparent Km and Vmax for leucine and sucrose loading in the phloem differed. Both leucine and sucrose translocation were inhibited by uncouplers, high K+, and p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid. Treatment with 0. 8 m sorbitol {{had little effect on}} sucrose translocation but stimulated leucine translocation, indicating an apoplastic route of loading for leucine. No effect on mass transfer rates was observed when sucrose and amino acids were applied exogenously together. These data provide evidence that phloem loading of amino acids and sucrose is mediated by different and separate carriers, both being dependent on an energy-requiring mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|Physical {{disintegration}} is {{the first}} stage in the transformation of parent material into soil. Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path {{toward the center of}} the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of [...] "shells". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles <b>to</b> be <b>abraded</b> <b>to</b> a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock. Finally, organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals. Grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation.|$|R

In view of the characteristic epidermal neutrophil infiltrate in psoriasis, the presence of leukotriene B 4 in samples from untreated lesional and uninvolved skin has been sought. Chambers were fixed <b>to</b> <b>abraded</b> skin and filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After 35 mm, the fluid was removed, and acidic lipids were extracted and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Extracts were purified by both straight- and reversed-phase HPLC, and assay of evaporated fractions by an agarose microdroplet chemokinesis technique indicated the presence of leukotriene B 4 -like material. No significant leukotriene B 4 - like activity was found in samples from uninvolved skin. Subsequent experiments using a modification of the initial skin chamber method indicated that leukotriene B 4 was being released from deeper layers of lesional skin and not only from superficial scale. Monohydroxy-ei- cosatetraenoic acid-like activity was also seen in lesional samples as determined by straight-phase HPLC and chemokinesis assay.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the oncogenic potential of HSV type 2 (HSV- 2) in vivo. A mouse model for lip carcinogenesis was designed to combine HSV- 2 infection, u. v. exposure and tetradecanoyl-phorbol-acetate (TPA) application. HSV- 2 inoculation on <b>to</b> <b>abraded</b> mouse lips was capable of causing vesicular ulcerative lesions which healed completely after 10 to 14 days. Ultraviolet irradiation of the HSV lesion site daily for 6 min at 42 ergs/mmVs on days 3 to 6 post-infection caused hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and dyslblasia to develop in several lips; while the same u. v. exposure by itself failed to alter the histologic appearance. The addition of repeated TPA application to the HSV+ u. v. regimen promoted tumour emergence. Thirty-two of 156 Balb/c mice developed tumours. Although the majority were papillomas, six were squamous cell carcinomas. These tumour-bearing mice had increased HSV-specific antibody titres. HSV antigens were shown to be present in outgrowths from explanted tumours as well as in tumour biopsies by immunoperoxidase staining with HSV-specific antisera. It is suggested that the in vivo u. v. -irradiated HSV acted as the inducer and TPA as the promoter, analogous to the classical two-stage carcinogenesis model...|$|R
40|$|To study H 2 O 2 production, the {{epidermal}} {{surfaces of}} hypocotyl segments from etiolated seedlings of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) were gently abraded. Freshly abraded segments were not constitutively competent for rapid H 2 O 2 elicitation. This capacity developed subsequent to abrasion in a time-dependent process that was greatly enhanced in segments exhibiting an acquired resistance to penetration of their epidermal cell walls by Colletotrichum lagenarium, because of root pretreatment {{of the respective}} seedlings with 2, 6 -dichloroisonicotinic acid. When this compound or salicylic acid was applied <b>to</b> <b>abraded</b> segments, it also greatly enhanced the induction of competence for H 2 O 2 elicitation. This process was fully inhibited by 5 [mu]M cycloheximide or 200 [mu]M puromycin, suggesting a requirement for translational protein synthesis. Both a crude elicitor preparation and a partially purified oligoglucan mixture from Phytophthora sojae also induced, in addition to H 2 O 2 production, a refractory state, which explains the transient nature of H 2 O 2 elicitation. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} the cucumber hypocotyl epidermis becomes conditioned for competence to produce H 2 O 2 in response to elicitors by a stimulus resulting from breaching the cuticle and/or cutting segments. This conditioning process is associated with protein synthesis and is greatly enhanced when substances able to induce systemic acquired resistance are present in the tissue...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time, the {{efficiency}} of different surface pretreatment approaches prior to adhesive bonding of a fibreglass-reinforced epoxy vinyl ester thermoset composite has been investigated. It was found that grit-blasting generally had a negligible effect on the surface free energy (SFE) calculated using the Owens, Wendt, Rabel, and Kaelble method, {{as well as the}} Lifshitz-van der Waals/acid-base (LWAB) approach. However, contrary <b>to</b> <b>abrading,</b> grit-blasting has shown its efficiency to flatten sharp surface irregularities and introduce surface roughness features suitable to adhesive bonding processes. With or without a previous grit-blasting step, argon gas atmospheric cold plasma treatment has shown a slight to moderate efficiency in increasing the SFE polar component of the composite. However, {{it was found that the}} addition of 0. 07 % oxygen to the argon plasma readily allows an important gain in the SFE polar component. Indeed, when processed at a speed of 30 m/min on a previously grit-blasted composite surface, the Ar/O 2 atmospheric cold plasma treatment increases the surface free energy to values > 73 mJ/m 2, making the surface condition optimized for structural adhesive bonding. An oxidation mechanism of the composite surface exposed to atmospheric cold plasma was suggested on the basis of correlations established between the polar part of SFE obtained from the Owens et al. method, acid/base components calculated using the LWAB approach, and ATR infrared spectroscopy signatures obtained for a model polyolefin material.

40|$|In most plants, sucrose is {{exported}} from source {{leaves to}} carbon-importing sink tissues {{to sustain their}} growth and metabolism. Apoplastic phloem-loading species require sucrose transporters (SUTs) to transport sucrose into the phloem. In many dicot plants, genetic and biochemical evidence has established that SUT 1 -type proteins function in phloem loading. However, the role of SUT 1 in phloem loading in monocot plants is not clear since the rice (Oryza sativa) and sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid) SUT 1 orthologues {{do not appear to}} function in phloem loading of sucrose. A SUT 1 gene was previously cloned from maize (Zea mays) and shown to have expression and biochemical activity consistent with a hypothesized role in phloem loading. To determine the biological function of SUT 1 in maize, a sut 1 mutant was isolated and characterized. sut 1 mutant plants hyperaccumulate carbohydrates in mature leaves and display leaf chlorosis with premature senescence. In addition, sut 1 mutants have greatly reduced stature, altered biomass partitioning, delayed flowering, and stunted tassel development. Cold-girdling wild-type leaves to block phloem transport phenocopied the sut 1 mutants, supporting a role for maize SUT 1 in sucrose export. Furthermore, application of 14 C-sucrose <b>to</b> <b>abraded</b> sut 1 mutant and wild-type leaves showed that sucrose export was greatly diminished in sut 1 mutants compared with wild type. Collectively, these data demonstrate that SUT 1 is crucial for efficient phloem loading of sucrose in maize leaves...|$|R
