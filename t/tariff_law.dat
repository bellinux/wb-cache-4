25|$|In April 1929, it was {{reported}} that President Herbert Hoover would appoint Edge United States Ambassador to France. He did not resign from the Senate and take office as Ambassador, however, until November 21, 1929, a delay attributable to political issues involving the appointment of a Republican successor to fill his Senate seat and the desire to have his expertise in the Senate while tariff legislation was considered. During the course of the tariff debates, Edge proved a protectionist who voted in favor of higher tariffs on imported goods. The resulting <b>tariff</b> <b>law,</b> the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, was not enacted until the spring of 1930, several months after Edge left the Senate.|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1832, Jackson {{signed into}} law the Tariff of 1832. It was {{designed}} to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates, but the nullifiers in South Carolina remained unsatisfied. On November 24, the South Carolina legislature officially nullified both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828, to be null and void as of February 1, 1833. In response, Jackson sent U.S. Navy warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang Calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession. Tensions eased after both sides agreed to the Compromise Tariff of 1833 on March 2, which was proposed by Henry Clay, now a senator, to change the <b>tariff</b> <b>law</b> {{in a way that}} satisfied Calhoun, who by then was in the Senate. On the same day, Congress passed the Force Bill, which empowered the President of the United States to use military force to ensure state compliance with federal law. South Carolina accepted the tariff, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill. In Calhoun's speech against the Force Bill, delivered on February 5, 1833, no longer as vice president, he strongly endorsed nullification, at one point saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{name has}} been {{associated}} with Jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties. [...] "The Age of Jackson" [...] shaped the national agenda and American politics. Jackson's philosophy as President was similar to that of Thomas Jefferson, advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation. Jackson took a moral tone, with the belief that agrarian sympathies, and a limited view of states rights and the federal government, would produce less corruption. He feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values. When South Carolina opposed the <b>tariff</b> <b>law,</b> he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.|$|E

The feed in-tariff has also kept electricity prices steady, as a tweak in the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>law</b> {{accounts for the}} volatility associated with power generated from wind and solar sources. It is also estimated that in Germany {{nearly half of the}} country's energy capacity was run by cooperatives or owned by citizens through private installations.|$|E

However, many of the delegates' governments did the opposite, starting in 1928 when France passed a new <b>tariff</b> <b>law</b> and quota system.|$|E
50|$|In September 1922, the Fordney-McCumber Tariff bill (named after Joseph Fordney, {{chair of}} the House Ways and Means Committee, and Porter McCumber, {{chair of the}} Senate Finance Committee) was signed by President Warren Harding. In the end, the <b>tariff</b> <b>law</b> raised the American ad valorem tariff rate {{to an average of}} about 38.5 percent for {{dutiable}} imports and an average of 14% overall. The measure was defensive tariff rather than an offensive. An ad valorem tariff was determined by the cost of production and market value.|$|E
50|$|The grain supply, {{road traffic}} and spirits referendums were popular initiatives, which {{required}} a double majority; {{a majority of}} the popular vote and majority of the cantons. The decision of each canton was based on the vote in that canton. Full cantons counted as one vote, whilst half cantons counted as half. The <b>tariffs</b> <b>law</b> question was an optional referendum, requiring only a majority of voters in favour.|$|R

However, the United States Senate speedily substituted a bill written by Aldrich, calling for fewer reductions and more increases in tariffs.|$|R

5000|$|Smyth v. Ames, 171 U.S. 361 (1898), {{also called}} The Maximum Freight Case, was an 1898 United States Supreme Court case.

The Court defined the constitutional limits of governmental power to set railroad and utility rates by stating that regulated industries {{have the right to}} a [...] "fair return".

5000|$|Puerto Rico was not {{a foreign}} country for tariff {{purposes}} but was a United States territory because, by treaty, the district was ceded to and {{in the possession of}} the United States.

25|$|The United States needed $3.1 {{billion to}} pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War — over $400million just in 1862.

Second came much higher tariffs, through several Morrill <b>tariff</b> <b>laws.</b> Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.|$|R
