5|$|An {{extensive}} canal {{system remains}} from the Industrial Revolution, {{with the city}} having more miles of canal than Venice, although because Birmingham is much larger than Venice <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> are less of a prominent feature {{than they are in}} Venice. Nowadays <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> are mainly used for leisure purposes, and canalside regeneration schemes such as Brindleyplace have turned <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> into tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>canals</b> are {{the subject}} of active {{restoration}} projects. Local interest resulted {{in the formation of the}} Neath and Tennant Canals Preservation Society in 1974, to promote restoration of the canal, and carry out clearance and repairs using volunteers. In 2006 it was renamed the Neath and Tennant Canals Trust. They have worked alongside the two Canal companies, Neath Port Talbot Council, and a wide range of funders and bodies working for regeneration of the Neath valley, to enable significant sections of <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> to return to use.|$|E

25|$|In 1913 Mr A.J.Harmsworth {{tried to}} {{navigate}} <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> {{in a boat}} called Basingstoke. The journey was motivated {{by a desire to}} keep <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> open since <b>the</b> <b>Canal</b> Act of 1778 specified that if <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> was not used for 5 years then <b>the</b> land <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> was built on would be returned to the original owners. It is thought that it proved impossible to navigate <b>the</b> entire <b>canal</b> but despite this <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> was not abandoned.|$|R
5|$|An {{extensive}} canal network, {{including the}} Manchester Ship Canal, {{was built to}} carry freight from the Industrial Revolution onward; <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> are still maintained, though now largely repurposed to leisure use.• In 2012, plans were approved to introduce a water taxi service between Manchester city centre and MediaCityUK at Salford Quays.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the body}} of many species is almost {{radially}} symmetrical, the main axis is oral to aboral (from the mouth to the opposite end). However, since only two of <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> near the statocyst terminate in anal pores, ctenophores have no mirror-symmetry, although many have rotational symmetry, in other words if the animal rotates in a half-circle it looks the same as when it started.|$|E
5|$|The Company {{bought out}} the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1846, the Sheffield Canal in 1848, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1849. They then amalgamated with the South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway in 1850, {{to become the}} South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company. This in turn was leased to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1864. In order to allow an {{extension}} of the railway from Mexborough to Sheffield to pass under the railway line to Rotherham Westgate railway station, the Holmes cut below Ickles lock was diverted into the river, and the Eastwood cut below Rotherham lock was diverted to the east in 1864. The original bed was then filled in and the railway built along its course. Despite attempts to divert coal traffic to the railway, <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> maintained their traffic levels, carrying 982,000 tonnes in 1878 and 927,254 in 1888. However, there was dissatisfaction among users of <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> that the rates for traffic were higher than on the railways, and <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> were failing to modernise, as steam boats were banned, despite them having been in use for 50 years on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation.|$|E
2500|$|Several Aqueducts [...] {{were built}} {{along the route}} of <b>the</b> <b>Canal</b> du Midi.

25|$|<b>The</b> Grand <b>Canal</b> {{nominally}} runs between Beijing and Hangzhou over a {{total length}} of , however, only the section from Hangzhou to Jining is currently navigable. Its course is today divided into seven sections. From south to north these are <b>the</b> Jiangnan <b>Canal,</b> <b>the</b> Li <b>Canal,</b> <b>the</b> Zhong <b>Canal,</b> <b>the</b> Lu <b>Canal,</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Canal,</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Canal,</b> and <b>the</b> Tonghui River.|$|R
5|$|The Hyogo Unga is {{the generic}} {{name for the}} network of five canals located along the {{southern}} coast of Hyogo and Nagata Wards, facing Osaka Bay. <b>The</b> <b>canals</b> have a total length of 6,470 metres and total area of almost 34 hectares, {{making it one of}} the largest canal networks in Japan. They were first planned in the 1870s and completed in December 1899.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>canals</b> faced {{competition}} from the Vale of Neath Railway after 1851, but remained profitable until the early 1880s, {{in the case of}} the Neath Canal, and the 1890s for the Tennant. An unusual aspect of the Tennant's success was that tolls were maintained, although tonnage dropped. Most canals at this time made significant cuts to tolls in an attempt to remain competitive with the railways. After 1883, the Neath Canal carried small amounts of silica and gunpowder, but traffic had virtually ceased by 1921. Navigation on the Neath Canal came to an end in 1934, and on the Tennant Canal soon afterwards. However, most of the infrastructure was maintained as <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> supplied water to local industries.|$|E
5|$|The {{network was}} {{expanded}} by {{the opening of}} the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1802, linking to the River Trent, the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1804, linking to Barnsley, and the Sheffield Canal in 1819, which provided better access to Sheffield. All three were bought out by the Don Navigation in the 1840s, after which <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> were owned by a series of railway companies. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company was created in 1889 and eventually succeeded in buying back <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> and the Don Navigation in 1895, but plans for expansion were hampered by a lack of capital. One success was {{the opening of the}} New Junction Canal in 1905, jointly funded with the Aire and Calder Navigation.|$|E

5|$|The plan to {{regenerate}} central Scotland's canals and reconnect Glasgow with Edinburgh {{was led by}} British Waterways with support and funding from seven local authorities, the Scottish Enterprise Network, the European Regional Development Fund, and the Millennium Commission. Planners decided early on to create a dramatic 21st-century landmark structure to reconnect <b>the</b> <b>canals,</b> instead of simply recreating the historic lock flight.|$|E
5|$|A plan {{to upgrade}} the {{waterways}} to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats {{led to the formation}} of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1million, in addition to the cost of acquiring <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by compulsory purchase if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted negotiation and legal battles that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of <b>the</b> <b>canals,</b> and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some further developments took place.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. <b>The</b> <b>canals</b> leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> also directly lead {{to the root of}} the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E

5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> were {{owned by}} the London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on what they could carry, and <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a surplus of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a surplus of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats {{owned by the}} company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E
5|$|Originally an {{agricultural}} area noted for dairy farming, domestic spinning and weaving {{led to a}} considerable silk and, in the 20th century, cotton industry. Leigh also exploited the underlying coal measures particularly after the town was connected to <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> and railways. Leigh had an important engineering base. The legacy of Leigh's industrial past {{can be seen in}} the remaining red brick mills– some of which are listed buildings– although it is now a mainly residential town, with Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing packed around the town centre. Leigh's present-day economy is based largely on the retail sector.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{dramatic}} loss of any group of animals has been to wading birds. Their numbers were estimated by eyewitness accounts to be approximately 2.5million in the late 19th century. However, snowy egrets (Egretta thula), roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), and reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens) were hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction for the colorful feathers used in women's hats. After about 1920 when the fashion passed, their numbers returned in the 1930s, but over the next 50years actions by the C further disturbed populations. When <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> were constructed, natural water flow was restricted from the mangrove forests near the coast of Florida Bay. From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number than before <b>the</b> <b>canals</b> were constructed.|$|E
