5|$|For the 2010–2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among {{the groups}} are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations run <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>from</b> sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of Terminator 2 spanned 171 days between October 9, 1990, and March 28, 1991, {{during which}} the crew filmed at the Mojave Desert before visiting 20 different sites throughout California and New Mexico. These locations ran <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>from</b> the crowded Santa Monica Place shopping mall, where the two Terminators converged on John, with brief shots coming from the Westfield MainPlace and Los Cerritos Center, to flood control channels in the San Fernando Valley, which played host to the chase between the Terminators and John; a river had to be redirected to allow filming on the otherwise wet channels. Cameron and his crew also filmed Terminator 2 at The Corral Bar and the Lake View Medical Center (known as Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in the film), both located in Lake View Terrace. The external shots of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation were filmed on location at an office building {{on the corner of}} Gateway Boulevard and Bayside Parkway in Fremont, California. Working with up to 1,000 crew members, the production team oversaw numerous stunts and chase sequences, the most notable of which took place on the Los Angeles–Long Beach Terminal Island Freeway, prior to Terminator 2s climax. Tenmiles (16km) of electric cables were laid to illuminate the night-time chase, which saw a full-scale helicopter crash, a sliding tanker, and other elaborate paraphernalia.|$|E

In its early phase, exhibited by the Oikumene of the Demon Princes series, this expanding, loose and pacific agglomerate has an aura of colonial adventure, commerce and exoticism. Later it becomes peace-loving and stolidly middle class.|$|E
25|$|Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander's persona runs <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>from</b> {{friendly}} charismatic, to terrifyingly sociopathic. His charm can twist {{intentions and}} morals, {{so that his}} rhetoric actually reads as plausible and relatable to his minions. Psychoanalysts who have studied his case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures across the globe.|$|E

25|$|Books {{requiring}} restoration or conservation treatment run <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>from</b> {{the very}} earliest of texts to books with modern bindings that have undergone heavy usage.

Many people choose to rebind books, from amateurs who restore old paperbacks on internet instructions to many professional book and paper conservators and restorationists, who often in the United States are members of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).|$|E

Participants in meetings had included Steinbeck, Bruce Ariss, Joseph Campbell (who {{had worked at}} the lab as Ricketts' assistant), Adelle Davis, Henry Miller, Lincoln Steffens and Francis Whitaker. Amidst the tumult of commercial activity and tourist attractions that Cannery Row has become in recent decades, the modest and mostly unnoticed and unmarked lab stands as a silent witness to the bygone era celebrated in Steinbeck's work.|$|E

25|$|Northwest Spain (Asturias, Galicia and Cantabria) {{is home to}} a {{distinct}} musical tradition extending back into the Middle Ages. The signature instrument of the region is the gaita (bagpipe). The gaita is often accompanied by a snare drum, called the tamboril, and is played in processional marches. Other instruments include the requinta, a kind of fife, as well as harps, fiddles, rebec and zanfona (hurdy-gurdy). The music itself runs <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>from</b> uptempo muinieras to stately marches. As in the Basque Country, Cantabrian music also features intricate arch and stick dances but the tabor pipe does not play as an important role as it does in Basque music. Traditionally, Galician music included a type of chanting song known as alalas. Alalas may include instrumental interludes, and were believed to have a very long history, based on legends.|$|E
25|$|The Libyan {{civil war}} has brought forth many new {{magazines}} and newspapers, including Al-Jazirah Al-Libiyah, Intifada Al-Ahrar, Al-Kalima, Libya Hurriya (Free Libya), Akhbar Al-Aan and many others.

So far all are weeklies and almost all are in Arabic. The Libya Post is the first all English language publication. Staffs run <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>from</b> enthusiastic amateur to professional. In spite of the large number of new publications, much of the coverage of the Libyan conflict has been left to international media outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera, in part {{due to a lack of}} experienced professional staff, in part to years of living under a repressive media regime, and in part due to a shortage of financing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There {{are very}} {{complicated}} nonlinear relations between input value and presentation color of digital prepress devices, {{as well as}} in <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> mapping among different devices. Not all the relations can be described by linear model properly. In recent years, neural network and black box theory are introduced to describe the relations. In this research, <b>the</b> printer <b>gamut</b> is divided into micro space sections, a relative colorimetric rending mapping method is proposed based on BP neural network theory to complete <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> mapping <b>from</b> monitor <b>gamut</b> to color printer. Experimental results show that the model reduces the color error of color blocks between the two devices, and the color rendering method can be used for gamut mapping of image with less continuous tone...|$|R
