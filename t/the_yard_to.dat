The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.|$|E

25|$|The {{colliery}} features both {{a standard}} gauge and narrow gauge railway - the former representing how coal was transported to its onward destination, {{and the latter}} typically used by Edwardian collieries for internal purposes. The standard gauge railway is laid out to serve the deep mine - wagons being loaded by dropping coal from the heapstead - and runs out of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> sidings laid out along {{the northern edge of}} the Pit Village.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s the Burntisland yard {{switched}} from shipbuilding to prefabricating modules of superstructure for offshore oil platforms, but orders were intermittent {{and by the}} 1980s the yard was largely idle. In 1990 new owners returned <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> production as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab, resuming the manufacture of superstructure modules for oil platforms. Under a management buyout in 2001 the Burntisland yard returned to being an independent company.|$|E
25|$|After fifty minutes, {{the hole}} was large enough to drag the {{patients}} through, and the men– save Privates Waters and Beckett, who hid in the wardrobe (Waters was wounded and Beckett died of assegai wounds)– were now in the last room, being defended by Privates Robert Jones and William Jones. From here, the patients clambered out through a window and then made their way across <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> the barricade.|$|E

25|$|On 8 December 1943, the US Navy {{seized control}} of Los Angeles SB under an {{executive}} order signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Bowen found <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> be in worse condition than the investigating board realized. Management {{was turned over to}} Todd Shipyards, which operated a number of other shipyards around the country. Todd would manage the yard for the Navy until the war ended after which Todd purchased the yard outright.|$|E
25|$|Sir Ivor holds a ball, {{to which}} members of the New Zealand's high society has been invited (including Louisa's parents). While waiting at the fence for a chance for Nicholas to go to <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> pour the neutralising agent in the container, music can be heard from Sir Ivor's ballroom and Nicholas teaches Jo to dance the old way. During the dance, Nicholas and Jo kiss each other, and Louisa and Tama shyly hold hands.|$|E
25|$|The first area of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> {{be removed}} was the 'Collingwood Sidings' in the {{northern}} corner, near the intersection of Wellington Parade South and Jolimont Road. The area was cleared of tracks during 1987 and 1988 and was offered for sale as a development site. Purchased by a company that later collapsed, {{it was not until}} the mid-1990s that the present apartment buildings have been built. High-rise apartments featured in the final stage, that ran into opposition in the early 2000s, but was approved in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Christen Christensen {{took over}} Rødsverven in 1868 and bought <b>the</b> other <b>yards</b> one by one. He started Sandefjord Flytedokker A/S in 1884. In 1892, he privately owned {{almost all of}} the {{properties}} that later became A/S Framnæs mek.Værksted. In the meantime, he also bought Kamfjordverven and Stubbverven. In order to finance the conversion of <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> steel shipbuilding, Christensen reorganized the corporate structure of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in 1898, <b>to</b> a shareholders' company. Sandefjord Flytedokker was dissolved and the two docks sold. New docks were then built by <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|R

50|$|Almost all ships used {{in modern}} times are fitted with steel safety wires (sometimes erroneously called jackstays) along <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> which sailors attach {{themselves}} using a harness. This is a relatively recent innovation - cargo-carrying and naval sailing ships were not so equipped and falling from <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> represented a real (though less than commonly imagined) risk.|$|R
25|$|During the Cuban {{missile crisis}} in 1962, the {{families}} of military personnel were evacuated from the base. Notified of the evacuation on 22 October, evacuees were told to pack one suitcase per family member, to bring evacuation and immunization cards, to tie pets in <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>to</b> leave {{the keys to the}} house on the dining table, and to wait {{in front of the house}} for buses. Dependents traveled to the airfield for flights to the United States, or to ports for passage aboard evacuation ships. After the crisis was resolved, family members were allowed to return to the base in December 1962.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 1973 the Yom Kippur War begun, {{causing the}} 1973 oil crisis, tripling oil prices to US$10 per barrel, halting {{economic}} growth. Newly build ships sometimes went straight from <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> lay-up. The situation worsened when the Suez Canal was reopened in 1975. Just {{when the situation}} began to improve in 1979, the Iranian Revolution caused the second oil crisis, causing oil prices to rise to US$30. Ships were sometimes sent to the breakers after being in service for only ten years. It took {{until the end of}} the 1980s before any profits were being made in oil transport.|$|E
25|$|An {{electrical}} substation {{was also}} erected {{to the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>to</b> feed power into the overhead wires. Of 18,000 kilowatt capacity, it was fitted with four 4500 kilowatt rotary converters and was the largest substation on the network until demolished in the early 1970s {{to make room for the}} City Loop portals for the Caulfield Group. Additional sidings were also provided in the triangle formed by the lines bound for Richmond and Jolimont. Located on the site of the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, the ground was acquired by the Victorian Railways and the Essendon Football Club played their final season there in 1921.|$|E

25|$|During {{his tenure}} at the navy yard Boarman {{supervised}} the fitting out of the Japan expedition under Commodore Matthew C. Perry. In May 1855, responding to reports by the Pierce Administration of a possible filibustering expedition being headed by Henry L. Kinney, Boarman used the naval forces under his command to form a blockade around Kinney's ship moored at an East River wharf effectively blocking Kinney and associate Joseph W. Fabens from leaving New York Harbor; the two were subsequently arrested. Four months after this incident, on September 18, 1855, Boarman {{was placed on the}} reserve list, less than a month before turning over command of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> Captain Abraham Bigelow, holding the rank of captain.|$|E
25|$|At {{its height}} Harland & Wolff boasted 35,000 {{employees}} {{and a healthy}} order book, but {{in the years following}} the cranes' construction the workforce and business declined. The last ship to be launched at <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> date was a roll-on/roll-off ferry in March 2003. Since then the yard has restructured itself to focus less on shipbuilding and more on design and structural engineering, as well as ship repair, offshore construction projects and competing for other projects to do with metal engineering and construction. Initially there was concern that the now largely redundant cranes would be demolished. However, later in the year they were scheduled as historic monuments under Article 3 of the Historic Monuments and Archaeological Objects (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, {{the yard}} was amalgamated into Upper Clyde Shipbuilders along with four others, {{in an attempt to}} {{increase}} competitiveness. The general elections in 1970 saw a change of government, and funding for {{the yard was}} withheld, resulting in the closure of John Brown's. It was bought from the receivers by the Houston, Texas-based Marathon Manufacturing Company for oil rig construction. [...] In 1980 Marathon sold <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> the French company Union Industrielle et d’Entreprise (UiE). UIE's owners, Bouygues Offshore closed the yard in 2001 and the site was earmarked for redevelopment.|$|E
50|$|The main {{thoroughfare}} in Rowhedge, the High Street, runs {{parallel to the}} Colne. At one time, it connected two areas of ship and boat construction and maintenance - <b>the</b> Upper <b>Yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, and <b>the</b> Lower <b>Yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. These were often known as 'Up Street' and 'Down Street' respectively. With the decline of ship building, housing estates have been built in both areas.|$|R

500|$|The two-story {{building}} {{was built in}} Georgian Revival style, and boasted a single schoolroom on the first floor, as well as six rooms for the teacher, their family, and student boarders {{from other parts of}} Vancouver Island. [...] A large brick fireplace, as well as a stove, provided heating for the building, and a bell salvaged from the wrecked steamship Major Tompkins was hung in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> call students to class. [...] Initially, the school was accessible from {{the main part of the}} farm only by boat, but the 1856 completion of the first Craigflower bridge linked the two parts of the farm together.|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Shelly Johnson, in {{collaboration}} with director Lurie and the design team, also used lighting and camerawork to signify the shifting of powers. For example, the yard is at first naturally lit and more influenced by daylight, in contrast to Winter's office, which is artificially illuminated by lamps. As the film progresses, the office is more fully infiltrated by exterior light through a broken window. The shift of power is also emphasized through camera techniques. Hand-held cameras were used when filming in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> make the audience {{feel as if they}} were [...] "participants in the action". However, a very precise, sterile camera composition was used in the warden's office. The prisoners' world gets more precise during the film, while the colonel's world is filmed more loosely.|$|E
500|$|After the {{recruitment}} project ended, the Admiralty sold {{the land to}} the British army for £2800 (£204,081 as of 2010) {{for use as a}} military prison. The first 70 prisoners arrived in 1856. At this time, flogging was gradually being phased out as a punishment for military members, who were instead imprisoned under the Mutiny Act of 1844; the purchase of Melville Island allowed these prisoners to be removed from the overcrowded Halifax Citadel. A 22-man military guard supervised the prisoners, who were subjected to hard labour: the chief warder imported [...] of granite from Purcell's Cove for them to break. Punishments included solitary confinement or [...] "shot drill", where an inmate was made to carry [...] cannonballs from one end of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> the other. A new 34-cell prison building was constructed in 1884 to alleviate overcrowding. There were some escape attempts during this period, the most violent of which involved the stone hammers used to break stone being repurposed as projectiles and weapons.|$|E
