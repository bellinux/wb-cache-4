5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} therefore appointed {{three new}} {{members to the}} commission on 6 February 1987 and ordered a new investigation of the accident. The new members were Appeal Judge Christian Borchsenius, Erik Øie of the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration and Professor Janne Carlzon of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The expanded commission was ordered to especially look into three issues: all air movements in the area at the time; how <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the torque tube was caused; {{and the use of}} medication by the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} most {{extensive}} recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, {{who was responsible for}} restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Musée Napoléon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to Mona Lisas left elbow with watercolour.|$|E

500|$|Mint {{director}} Nellie Tayloe Ross {{had long}} admired Franklin, and {{wanted him to}} be depicted on a coin. [...] In 1947, she instructed her chief engraver, John R. Sinnock, to prepare designs for a Franklin half dollar. Sinnock's designs were based on his earlier work, but he died before their completion. The designs were completed by Sinnock's successor, Gilroy Roberts. [...] The Mint submitted the new designs to the Commission of Fine Arts ("Commission") for its advisory opinion. The Commission disliked the small eagle and felt that depicting <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the Liberty Bell would expose the coinage to jokes and ridicule. [...] Despite the Commission's disapproval, the Mint proceeded with Sinnock's designs.|$|E
500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness {{was placed in a}} Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now {{it was time for a}} casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform and tried to make it [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E
500|$|Chibnall {{was elected}} by {{executive}} producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger to write a two-part episode about {{the return of the}} Silurians.

The episode is also connected to the series' story arc, as <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the universe returns {{at the end of the}} episode. [...] "The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] were filmed in October and November 2009, with scenes in [...] "Cold Blood" [...] shot in Llanwynno, Wales, Cardiff's Temple of Peace, Plantasia, and an array of locations and sets for parts of the Silurian city, which the production team did not want to look like a cave. The episode was watched by 7.49 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics. Some reviewers were disappointed by the plot and characteristics of the Silurians, but the emotional ending was widely praised.|$|E

We have examined in this manner both <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> annealed samples and as-indented cracks. We have found that the fracture behavior for <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> these two types of samples differ quite significantly, with <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> annealed samples exhibiting a partial crack closure characteristic and <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> as-indented samples displaying both crack closure and crack growth effects...|$|R

In addition, the [...] "wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey" [...] line {{has been used to}} describe several of Moffat's complex time travel stories, such as [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] and [...] "The Big Bang". The line was also referenced in the first episode of the fifth series, [...] "The Eleventh Hour", when the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) scans <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> young Amelia Pond's (Caitlin Blackwood) wall with his sonic screwdriver.

River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the Doctor says he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell to ask him about the condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing on his arms, indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume.

He {{triggers}} Amy's memories, {{but as she}} remembers, it is revealed that the centurion Rory is actually an Auton—a duplicate of living plastic—created from Amy's memories to help capture the Doctor. Rory's consciousness tries to fight his programming, but he is compelled to shoot and kill her. Amy's body is kept alive in the Pandorica, a special prison intended to trap the Doctor. The Auton Rory protects it for 2000 years. The Doctor realises that Amy {{is connected to the}} cracks in the universe which originated from a temporal explosion on her wedding day. He tells her that her parents had been erased by <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> her wall and urges her to remember them. After he uses the Pandorica to reboot the universe, the Doctor travels back through his timeline and is able to plant memories in Amy of the TARDIS. Amy awakes on her wedding day in a timeline where her parents are again part of reality and marries a restored Rory. Her memories are stirred by the TARDIS-shaped diary River Song (Alex Kingston) leaves for her. Once Amy remembers the Doctor, he is restored to reality. It is mentioned in The Sarah Jane Adventures serial Death of the Doctor that the Doctor dropped Amy and Rory off on a [...] "honeymoon planet", and the couple continues their honeymoon aboard an interstellar cruise ship which the Doctor saves from crashing into a populated planet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} coarse-graining {{technique}} to reduce a given atomistic model into an equivalent coarse grained continuum model. The developed technique is tailored for problems involving complex <b>crack</b> patterns <b>in</b> 2 D and 3 D including crack branching and coalescence. Atoms on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> surface {{are separated from}} the atoms not on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> surface by employing the centro symmetry parameter. A rectangular grid is superimposed on the atomistic model. Atoms on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> surface <b>in</b> each cell are used to estimate <b>the</b> equivalent coarse-scale <b>crack</b> surface of that particular cell. <b>The</b> <b>crack</b> path <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coarse model is produced by joining <b>the</b> approximated <b>crack</b> paths <b>in</b> each cell. The developed technique serves as a sound basis to study <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> propagation <b>in</b> multiscale methods for fracture...|$|R
