5|$|Both parties {{reached a}} {{settlement}} on 20 April 2007, agreeing {{to drop their}} respective lawsuits. Under {{the terms of the}} settlement, Thompson has been barred from suing to ban the sale or distribution of games by Take-Two or its subsidiaries. He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop <b>the</b> <b>contempt</b> of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. <b>The</b> <b>contempt</b> of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E

5|$|In 1983's Never Say Never Again, Edward Fox played M as a bureaucrat, {{contemptuous of}} Bond—far {{removed from the}} {{relationship}} shared between Bernard Lee's M and Sean Connery's Bond; the academic Jeremy Black notes that <b>the</b> <b>contempt</b> felt for the 00 section by Fox's M was reciprocated by Connery's Bond. Fox's M is also younger {{than any of the}} previous incarnations. The media historian James Chapman notes that whilst M considers Bond to be an out-dated relic, the Foreign Secretary orders the 00 section to be re-activated.|$|E
5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often centring on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He {{came to believe that}} the historical Jesus bore little relationship to the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and <b>the</b> <b>contempt</b> of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's father, King Thomas, {{had great}} ambitions for him. An attempt {{to expand into}} Croatia proper by marrying Stephen to a wealthy widow failed, and {{negotiations}} for a marital alliance with the Sforzas of Milan were abandoned when a more prestigious opportunity presented itself: marriage to the heiress Maria of Serbia in April 1459 made Stephen the ruler of {{the remnants of the}} neighbouring country. The intent was to unite the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Serbian Despotate under Stephen to combat the expanding Ottoman Empire. Stephen's Catholicism made him unpopular in Orthodox Serbia. After ruling it for merely two months, however, Stephen surrendered it to the encroaching Ottoman forces and fled back to his father's court, which earned him <b>the</b> <b>contempt</b> of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus and other Christian rulers in Europe.|$|E

25|$|In April 1930, Capone {{was arrested}} on {{vagrancy}} charges when visiting Miami Beach; the governor had ordered sheriffs to run {{him out of the}} state. Capone claimed that Miami police had refused him food and water and threatened to arrest his family. He was charged with perjury for making these statements, but was acquitted after a three-day trial in July. In September, a Chicago judge issued a warrant for Capone's arrest on charges of vagrancy, and then used the publicity to run against Thompson in the Republican primary. In February 1931, Capone was tried on <b>the</b> <b>contempt</b> of court charge. In court, Judge James Herbert Wilkerson intervened to reinforce questioning of Capone's doctor by the prosecutor.
