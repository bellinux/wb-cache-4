5|$|The silver medals {{from the}} 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to run, {{and he took}} a more serious, more mature stance towards his career. Bolt {{continued}} to develop in the 100 m, and he entered to run in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s <b>tail</b> <b>wind,</b> improving his personal best from 10.03 s. This was the second-fastest legal performance {{in the history of the}} event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy. Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, praising Bolt's form and technique especially. Michael Johnson, who was observing the race, said that he was shocked at how quickly he had improved over the 100 m distance. The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2005, a Dash 8-100 {{registered}} LN-WIK crashed during {{landing at}} Hammerfest Airport. Just before landing the wind speed veered and increased, creating a <b>tail</b> <b>wind.</b> The {{increase in the}} descent rate was compensated, but was insufficient, and the aircraft touched down on the right main landing gear, with the leg failing and the aircraft sliding on its belly. The aircraft was written off and Widerøe was criticized for permitting landings under high winds and gusts. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority imposed stricter wind regulations on the airport.|$|E
25|$|Her {{definite}} international breakthrough came in 2007. She improved {{both her}} personal best jumps with good margins. In May in Belém she jumped 6.88 metres, and in São Paulo in June she jumped 14.57 metres for a continental and championship record at the 2007 South American Championships in Athletics. She {{also won the}} silver medal {{in the long jump}} behind Maggi. In May she had become the first South American woman to break the 15-metre-barrier. However, her 15.10 m jump in Uberlândia, Brazil had a <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> of 2.7 m/second, and thus could not be accepted. When jumping 14.57, she established a new South American record. At the 2007 Pan American Games she won two silver medals, and at the 2007 World Championships in August she finished ninth in the triple and seventh in the long jump competition. At the World Athletics Final {{towards the end of the}} season, she finished sixth in the triple and fifth in the long jump.|$|E

50|$|On 28 April 2007 in Berkeley, California, Atkins again {{lowered the}} {{national}} record, to 9.98 seconds. He also ran 9.86 s and 9.83 s, though with <b>tail</b> <b>winds</b> of 2.3 and 2.4 m/s.|$|R
50|$|Her 21.71 second {{performance}} for 200 m was {{run into a}} head wind of -0.8 m/s. By comparison, Marita Koch's 21.71 second runs in 1979 and 1984 had <b>tail</b> <b>winds</b> of +0.7 m/s and +0.3 m/s respectively.|$|R
500|$|The Widerøe Dash 8-103 {{aircraft}} LN-WIK {{underwent a}} hard landing on 1 May 2005. The aircraft, on route from Tromsø, was landing on Runway 05 when it experienced a veering wind which changed direction, {{resulting in an}} increased <b>tail</b> <b>wind.</b> The pilot attempted to counteract the increased descent rate by increasing to full throttle. This was not sufficient and the aircraft carried out a hard landing just inside the threshold, with the starboard landing gear collapsing. The aircraft slid on its belly along the runway for [...] and was damaged beyond repair. Widerøe permitted aircraft to land in the maximum certified wind conditions, a cross-wind of 18meters per second (36knots) and 5meters per second (10knots) <b>tail</b> <b>wind.</b> Twenty-five passengers and the three crew members were all transported to hospital, although there were no serious injuries. Widerøe enforced its strictest wind restrictions of any airport at Hammerfest after the accidents.|$|E
500|$|Bolt {{set a new}} 100 m {{world record}} on 31 May 2008. At the Reebok Grand Prix held in the Icahn Stadium in New York City, Bolt ran 9.72 s with a <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> of 1.7m/s. This race was Bolt's fifth senior 100 m. Gay again {{finished}} second and said of Bolt: [...] "It looked like his knees were going past my face." [...] Commentators noted that Bolt appeared to have gained a psychological advantage over fellow Olympic contender Gay.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2013 season Tyson started off with a world leading time of 9.86 seconds at the Jamaican invitational meet. At the 2013 National Championships Gay did not come away from the blocks well, but pulled away from Justin Gatlin to win his 100m semi-final in a windy 9.76 seconds. In the final, he again did not start well, but at 70 meters he pulled away to win in a World Leading time, and his 3rd fastest ever, of 9.75 seconds with a <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> of 1.1 meters per second. He was [...]14 seconds ahead of the second place Gatlin, who ran a season best of 9.89 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Inclement weather such as clouds, rain, thunderstorms, {{and snow}} may be encountered. Time of day {{is also part}} of the game (daytime, sunset, and night). Every airport at any time can have no <b>wind,</b> head <b>winds,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>winds,</b> cross winds, and a variety of wind speeds. The flight path and wind {{patterns}} become more difficult with each successive landing as players progress.|$|R
50|$|The IAAF {{considers}} marks set at {{high altitude}} as acceptable for record consideration. However, high altitude can significantly assist sprint performances. One estimate suggests {{times in the}} 200m sprint can be assisted by between 0.09 s and 0.14 s with the maximum allowable <b>tailing</b> <b>wind</b> of (2.0 m/s), and gain 0.3 s at altitudes over 2000 m. For this reason, unofficial low-altitude record lists have been compiled.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the case}} of transcontinental {{migration}} where distances are large, the flying speed of the butterfly ( [...] {{of the order of}} 3 metres per second or less) is inadequate for timely completion of journey. The migration is carried out by relying on heavy winds; a persistent wind speed of 10 metres per second being able to provide a displacement of 300 to 400 kilometers in a single day. For example, the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) migrates from Africa to Spain aided by <b>tail</b> <b>winds.</b>|$|R
500|$|All of Gay's 200m runs {{during the}} season were wind aided, which meant not only would he need to place in the National Championships, {{he would need to}} achieve the [...] "A Standard" [...] of 20.52 seconds. In his semi-final, he did surpass the {{standard}} with a run of 20.07, although it was another wind aided run. During the replay of the race, it was revealed that Gay had stepped on the line of his inside lane, which would normally result in a disqualification, but it was overlooked and Gay safely advanced to the final. During the final, Gay lead all of the way. He powered down the home straight to win in a World Leading time of 19.74 seconds, with a legal <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> of 1.6 meters per second.|$|E
2500|$|Five {{hours into}} the flight, Hegenberger decided to alter course to confirm his {{calculations}} with another visual checkpoint. Using its noon position, he plotted an intercept of the Matson passenger liner SS Sonoma, overflying the ship at 2:45p.m. when it was [...] from San Francisco. Hegenberger recorded that the C-2 had picked up a strong <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> around noon, pushing them {{for the remainder of}} the flight at an average speed of , and plotted a new course parallel to the original.|$|E
2500|$|The raiders faced several {{unforeseen}} challenges {{during their}} flight to China: night was approaching, the aircraft were running low on fuel, {{and the weather}} was rapidly deteriorating. None would have reached China if not for a <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> as they came off the target, which increased their ground speed by [...] for seven hours. The crews realized they would probably {{not be able to}} reach their intended bases in China, leaving them the option of either bailing out over eastern China or crash-landing along the Chinese coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{facilities}} at INS Utkrosh have been significantly upgraded. The runway has been lengthened to almost 11000 ft. Except for the civilian terminal {{operated by the}} Airports Authority of India, all other air traffic operations over Port Blair are undertaken by INS Utkrosh.The geography makes this a difficult airfield for aircraft, as a hillock at one end means that planes can land or take off only in one direction. Winds change here every six months, so pilots have to either take off or land with strong <b>tail</b> <b>winds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fire control}} system calculates a firing {{solution}} manifested by the barrel’s {{angle of elevation}} using target range information from the laser rangefinder (the rangefinder is activated by pushing {{a button on the}} pistol grip, below the trigger), corrected manually by the shooter through a push-button interface (add/subtract buttons) on the FCS top cover to take account for head or <b>tail</b> <b>winds</b> that could affect the desired range. The F2000 FCS also contains software with the ballistic properties of up to six types of 40 mm grenades and can be reprogrammed to take advantage of future munition improvements. Batteries for the FCS are located {{in the bottom of the}} buttstock.|$|R
50|$|Garfield sends Sullivan a {{suggestion}} for conserving fuel that he fears Sullivan will disregard as disparaging his flying ability. Dan's experience {{tells him that}} their luck would be better trying to make land than ditching in the rough seas at night, and he recognizes that fear rather than judgment is governing Sullivan's decisions. When Sullivan panics and prepares to ditch immediately, Dan slaps {{him back to his}} senses. Dan adjusts the controls without Sullivan's permission to save gas. A recalculation of the remaining fuel convinces Dan the fuel supply is barely sufficient to reach San Francisco if the <b>tail</b> <b>winds</b> continue to increase, which persuades Sullivan to make the gamble.|$|R
2500|$|Pigeons {{are sexually}} mature at {{about six months}} of age. However, fanciers will often wait until the pigeon {{is at least a}} few months older before breeding. [...] The first egg is laid and not {{incubated}} until the clutch is complete, with eggs being laid every other day. A hen bird will usually only lay two eggs in a clutch. The incubation period is 17 days. Pigeon breeders are careful in selecting birds to pair together so as to continue improving the breed and gain a competitive edge. It is this selective breeding that has given rise to the racing pigeons of today, capable of finding their way home from over [...] away and flying at speeds in excess of [...] with a <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> but average [...] on a calm day. Hens are often capable of laying upwards of 12 eggs per year, and squabs usually leave the nest at approximately three to four weeks of age.|$|E
2500|$|During the mid-1950s, {{planners}} {{devised the}} idea of extending the wall of powerful land-based radar seaward with Airborne early warning and control units. [...] This was done by equipping two wings of Lockheed RC-121 Warning Star aircraft, the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, based at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, and the 552nd AEWCW, based at McClellan Air Force Base, California, one wing stationed on each coast. [...] The RC-121s, EC-121s and Texas Towers, it was believed, would contribute to extending contiguous east-coast radar coverage some 300 to 500 miles seaward. In terms of the air threat of the 1950s, this meant a gain of at least 30 extra minutes warning time of an oncoming bomber attack.	ADC's Operation <b>Tail</b> <b>Wind</b> on 11–12 July tested its augmentation plan that required Air Training Command interceptors participate in an air defense emergency. A total of seven ATC bases actively participated in the exercise, deploying aircraft and aircrews and supporting the ADC radar net. [...] As the USAF prepared to deploy the Tactical Air Command E-3 Sentry in the later 1970s, active-duty units were phased out EC-121 operations {{by the end of}} 1975. [...] All remaining EC-121s were transferred to the Air Force Reserve, which formed the 79th AEWCS at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida in early 1976. The active duty force continued to provide personnel to operate the EC-121s on a 24-hour basis, assigning Detachment 1, 20th Air Defense Squadron to Homestead AFB as associate active duty crews to fly the Reserve-owned aircraft. Besides monitoring Cuban waters, these last Warning Stars also operated from NAS Keflavik, Iceland. Final EC-121 operations ended in September 1978.|$|E

50|$|Even in a free-flight area, {{air traffic}} control still {{requires}} a position report about once an hour. Flight planning systems organise this by inserting geographic waypoints at suitable intervals. For a jet aircraft, these intervals are 10 degrees of longitude for eastbound or westbound flights and 5 degrees of latitude for northbound or southbound flights. In free-flight areas, commercial aircraft normally follow a least-time-track so as to use as little time and fuel as possible. A great circle route would have the shortest ground distance, but is unlikely to have the shortest air distance, due {{to the effect of}} head or <b>tail</b> <b>winds.</b> A flight planning system may have to perform significant analysis to determine a good free-flight route.|$|R
