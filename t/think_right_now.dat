She said her previous tour, Wonder World Tour, focused more on theatrics and costume changes. The singer wanted the show to focus on the music and letting the audience see a different side of her that is not portrayed on television.

Sh-'s gonna be hot as a mofo ... Miss this and you be missing the biggest dance party of the year!"The set list is mainly derived from Kesha's first album Animal, and follow-up extended play (EP) Cannibal. Besides tracks from those albums, Kesha incorporated covers of the Beastie Boys song, [...] "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" [...] to [...] "give the show a more rock'n'roll edge." [...] She told Kevin O'Donnell of Spin, [...] "I've been on this Iggy Pop kick — he's just so inspiring to watch as a performer, ...

That's my mentality with this tour — party as hard as we can and make it as infectious as possible. It's unlike anything anyone else in pop music is doing." [...] Visually, the theaters and auditoriums hosting the show will be transformed and presented as [...] "basement rave-ups". The inspiration came from her earlier life when she was growing up in Tennessee where she would attend parties. To achieve this look, the singer worked with the creative team responsible for Daft Punk's concerts. The look is described as Mad Max and [...] "intergalactic spaceship" [...] combination.|$|E

Let me deal with the consequences." [...] —Morgan's take on Kristina's decisions Along with the reality show storyline comes a new love interest for Kristina in Erik Valdez's Trey Mitchell, a grad student from Yale who convinces her to launch the Mob Princess series. According to Morgan, Kristina is very much blindsided by Trey as she is going through a time in her life where she is trying to find some stability. Coming from such an unconventional family where her parents never actually tried to be together leaves Kristina yearning for that family unit she never had with her parents. Even though Trey appears to be manipulating her, Kristina hopes the relationship will turn into something more when they marry on August 28, 2012. Kristina's need for a stable family is reflected in her concern for her sister, Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) when her marriage begins falling apart. Though Kristina has always dreamed of having that [...] "perfect family," [...] she does not see her marriage to Trey being a major deal because she expects the marriage will be over just as quickly as it began. Kristina goes through with the marriage to help Trey realize how much she really does care for him, and hopes he will reciprocate those feelings. Morgan admitted to being confused as to why she trusts Trey so much, as opposed to her family, {{especially when it comes to}} her older brother, Michael (Chad Duell). Morgan revealed in an interview Kristina still sees Michael as the overprotective big brother and since leaving college, she's been trying to assert her independence. In a November 2012 interview, Morgan gave her take on Kristina's reason for falling for Trey; besides his looks, Trey is very different from the guys she's date previously or has been interested in. When Kristina is humiliated at school thanks to everyone finding out about Sonny pulling strings to get her in, Trey is the only person who likes her for who she is. [...] "Even when he was playing her, and he obviously did play her - he was probably the person that showered her with the most attention. She took that as 'he's so together, he's interested in my life and I'm his muse, I'm in his star. That meant a lot her, especially after being with guys who never treated her that way or never really seemed to care about her." [...] When asked if Kristina could forgive Trey, Morgan explained that it is definitely a possibility and describes Trey as being the most real love interest for her character. [...] "I mean, he shot his own father to protect her in the end. So he did make the right decision in the end, but it took him a while. I <b>think</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> she's just so hurt by it and just so in shock. I could see if like it was 'never again, we'll be perfect together' and whatnot. But I could see her forgiving him, but knowing her it would take a while. And take lots of flowers and candy." ...|$|E
