5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150–195m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|E

5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E

25|$|Acoustically, a djembe is a Helmholtz resonator: the {{frequency}} of the bass is determined by {{the size and shape of}} the shell and independent of the amount of <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skin. In contrast, the pitch of tones and slaps rises as the tension of the skin is increased. The bass has a frequency of 65–80Hz. Depending on the size of the drum and the amount of <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skin, tone frequency varies from 300Hz to 420Hz and slap frequency from 700Hz to 1000Hz, with audible overtones reaching beyond 4kHz.|$|E

25|$|In the {{balanced}} action system, a spring or hydraulic cylinder {{is used to}} balance the <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head so the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch.

25|$|Poor shoeing and conformation, such as long, sloping pasterns, upright pasterns, long-toes {{with low}} heels, pigeon toes, splay foot, or {{unbalanced}} feet may predispose {{the horse to}} ringbone, as they create uneven stress on the pastern and coffin joint, unequal <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soft tissues, or worsen the concussion that is absorbed by the pastern area.|$|E
25|$|Gas distention usually {{produces}} mild clinical signs, but in {{some cases}} leads to severe signs due to pressure and <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mesentery.

25|$|Excessive <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tendons, ligaments, {{and joint}} {{capsules}} of the pastern area can strain the periosteum. The body compensates by growing bone at the stresspoint. Strain on the extensor tendon, the superficial digital flexor tendon branches, the collateral ligaments, and the distal sesamoidean ligaments are all common factors. If these tissues are stretched or torn, {{and the joint}} is instabilized by the injury, new bone is produced to help to stabilize the joint.|$|E
25|$|After 1967 {{tensions}} between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots subsided. Instead, {{the main source of}} <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island came from factions within the Greek Cypriot community. Although Makarios had effectively abandoned enosis in favour of an ‘attainable solution’, many others continued to believe that the only legitimate political aspiration for Greek Cypriots was union with Greece. Makarios was branded a traitor to the cause by Grivas and, in 1971, he made a clandestine return to the island.|$|E
25|$|The 1910 Mexican Revolution {{had raised}} {{tensions}} {{along the border}} of Texas and Mexico. Immigration into the southern US states from Mexico rose, with nearly one million Mexicans entering the United States {{at the turn of}} the century. Land redistribution efforts in Mexico made Anglo-Americans nervous about disputed land claims between the United States and Mexico. This tension, mixed with fears that Mexico would side with Germany in the first World War, created extraordinary <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{techniques}} for measuring in-situ infiltration {{include the use}} of a single or double ring infiltrometer. Single and double ring infiltrometer only measures flow under ponded (saturated) conditions, and when used in soil with distinct macropores, preferential flow will dominate the flow. (See: Poiseuille's law) This does not reflect infiltration under rainfall or sprinkler irrigation. Therefore, many authors attempted to create a negative potential (<b>tension)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water flow. This is to exclude macropores in the flow process, hence only measuring the soil matrix flow.|$|E
25|$|When skeining from wheel spun yarn, the bobbin {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the bobbin is left on the wheel the <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drive band must be lessened in order to allow the bobbin to turn freely. Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto a dowel for plying. The spindle or dowel is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|E
25|$|The Partition was {{a highly}} {{controversial}} arrangement, and remains a cause of much <b>tension</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indian subcontinent today. According to Allen McGrath many British leaders including the British Viceroy, Mountbatten, were unhappy over the partition of India. Lord Mountbatten of Burma had not only been accused of rushing the process through, but also {{is alleged to have}} influenced the Radcliffe Line in India's favour. The commission took longer to decide on a final boundary than on the partition itself. Thus the two nations were granted their independence even before there was a defined boundary between them.|$|E
