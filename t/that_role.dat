40|$|Roles are a {{powerful}} paradigm to develop distributed applications based on agents, {{especially when they}} are in need of interacting with other entities. An agent-oriented approach requires <b>that</b> <b>roles</b> are conceived as first-class entities, {{and at the same time}} <b>that</b> <b>roles</b> are dynamically embedded into agents at runtime. In this paper we propose an approach that addresses such requirements, enabling Java agents to dynamically assume roles. We present a mechanism that modifies the agent bytecode to add the role features. 1...|$|R

His brother Jon, who had been president of Bank of America Stadium, stepped down at the same time. The resignations of Mark and Jon Richardson were unexpected, as it was thought that the two would eventually take over the team from their father. Mark Richardson was replaced by Danny Morrison, who had previously served as the athletic director of both Texas Christian University and Wofford College, Richardson's alma mater.|$|E

30|$|On a {{theoretical}} level, we argue <b>that</b> a <b>role</b> {{scheme based on}} brokerage is more discriminating than a scheme based on degree. The findings show <b>that</b> <b>roles</b> based on brokerage result in a reduction of the network that is more informative about the functions that nodes play. The reason, we sustain, is that the analysis of brokerage allows integrating more levels of analysis (from local bridges in open triads to ties linking modules), and it thus offers a more informative definition of structural similarity.|$|R

Although traditionally, society claims <b>that</b> <b>roles</b> within a heterosexual marriage should be decided based on one’s biological sex, today individuals are determining their own roles for themselves, ultimately creating equal partnerships.|$|R
