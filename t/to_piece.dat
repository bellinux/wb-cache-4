5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards a {{patch of}} missing data in Google Sky near the constellation of Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers. A scientist at Google said that the missing data {{is due to a}} glitch in the stitching software used <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> the images together.|$|E
5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together the clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E
5|$|In October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who {{was then}} acting in New York on the CBS soap opera The Secret Storm), needed {{immediate}} medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite {{the fact that}} Christina's character was a 28-year-old and Crawford was in her sixties, Crawford offered to play her role until Christina was well enough to return, to which producer Gloria Monty readily agreed. Although Crawford did well in rehearsal, she lost her composure while taping and the director and producer were left to struggle <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together the necessary footage.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} for scholars <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together the exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|It {{took several}} years {{and a team of}} assistants <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> {{together}} the scanned fragments (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky's Judgment in Moscow (1995), where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West.|$|E

5|$|The fifth known {{storm of}} the year was yet another cyclone first {{identified}} in post-season reanalysis. Forming on September 18 well to the north of Puerto Rico, efforts made <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together wind observations from ships reveal a track that curved toward the northwest, passing about midway between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda before heading northeast. Based on available information, the cyclone is estimated to have remained at tropical storm intensity for its entire existence. It is last noted southeast of New England on September 21.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective.

5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has {{little control over}} the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E
5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work {{needed to be done}} on the armament, but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the mind control device turns people's fears into paranoid delusions. Mulder tries to contact Dr. Stroman with no success. He traces Dr. Stroman's location to an empty hotel room where he finds cigarettes in the ash tray. Using the phone log for the room Mulder tracks Stroman to a house where he spots him meeting with the cable repairman. However, by the time Mulder enters, shots ring out, and Mulder finds both men dead, with X (Steven Williams) responsible for their murders. X used a third party to inform Mulder, knowing he had orders to kill the men, but Mulder was not able <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> things together in time. Mulder calls him a coward but X tells Mulder that Mulder needs him. Later, X meets {{in a car with}} The Smoking Man (William B. Davis).|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk found it hard <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> together {{the relationship between the}} main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
