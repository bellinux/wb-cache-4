5|$|In the {{northern}} part of its range, the species often occurs with the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), but no evidence shows they compete with each other. In the south, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and <b>the</b> <b>rice</b> rat regularly occur together; water levels are known to influence relative abundance of these two species in Florida. The cotton rat is mainly active during the day, which may help differentiate its niche from that of <b>the</b> <b>rice</b> rat.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of the Miners Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail {{was too small to}} hold all 25 prisoners, most of them were jailed in <b>the</b> <b>Rice</b> Building. <b>The</b> <b>Rice</b> Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E

30|$|For the {{wintering}} test, {{the seeds}} of weedy rice {{were placed on the}} soil surface of a paddy with cultivated <b>rice</b> seeds during <b>the</b> 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 winter seasons from November to April. The viability of seeds after wintering was 4.3 % for cultivated rice, but 92.7 % for weedy rice in 2008 / 2009. In the second wintering test, the seeds were placed under flooded and dry paddy conditions. The seed viability of cultivated rice was 5 % in dry paddy and 0.5 % in flooded paddy, but weedy rice maintained a high viability during winter of 90 % in the dry paddy and 61 % in the flooded paddy. Following freezing treatment of the imbibed seeds, the seed viability was 78 % for weedy rice and 16 % for cultivated <b>rice.</b> <b>The</b> deterioration of seed tissue induced by freezing treatment was observed by the tetrazolium test. In an accelerated aging test at low temperature and soaking conditions, the seed viability of <b>the</b> weedy <b>rice</b> was 40 % higher than <b>the</b> cultivated <b>rice</b> 90 [*]days after treatment. During accelerated aging of seeds, the protein content remained higher in <b>the</b> weedy <b>rice</b> compared to <b>the</b> cultivated <b>rice,</b> and fat acidity remained lower in <b>the</b> weedy <b>rice</b> compared to <b>the</b> cultivated <b>rice.</b> Catalase and superoxide dismutase activity of <b>the</b> weedy <b>rice</b> was 4 times higher than that of <b>the</b> cultivated <b>rice,</b> and DPPH radical scavenging activity of <b>the</b> weedy <b>rice</b> was also much higher than for <b>the</b> cultivated <b>rice.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites <b>the</b> <b>rice</b> rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled <b>the</b> <b>rice</b> rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} retrograded rice on body weight gain, gut functions, and hypolipidemic actions in rats were examined. When <b>the</b> retrograded <b>rice</b> was {{produced}} by repetitive heating and cooling cycles, it contained significantly higher amounts of resistant starch (13. 9 ± 0. 98 %) than is found in common rice (9. 1 ± 1. 02 %) (P < 0. 05). Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either common rice powder or retrograded rice powder, and mean body weight gain was significantly lower in <b>the</b> retrograded <b>rice</b> group (P < 0. 05). The liver weight of <b>the</b> retrograded <b>rice</b> group (14. 5 ± 0. 5 g) was significantly {{lower than that of}} <b>the</b> common <b>rice</b> group (17. 1 ± 0. 3 g, P < 0. 05). However, the weights of other organs, such as the kidney, spleen, thymus, and epididymal fat pad were not significantly affected by rice feeding. Intestinal transit time tended to be lower in rats fed retrograded rice when compared to rats fed <b>the</b> common <b>rice,</b> but <b>the</b> difference was not significant. <b>The</b> retrograded <b>rice</b> diet significantly increased stool output when compared to that in <b>the</b> common <b>rice</b> powder diet (P < 0. 05), whereas fecal moisture content (%) was significantly higher in <b>the</b> retrograded <b>rice</b> group (23. 3 ± 1. 2) than that in <b>the</b> common <b>rice</b> group (19. 1 ± 1. 2) (P < 0. 05). <b>The</b> retrograded <b>rice</b> group had significantly lower plasma cholesterol (P < 0. 05), liver cholesterol (P < 0. 05), and triacylglycerol contents in adipose tissue (P < 0. 05) when compared to those in <b>the</b> common <b>rice</b> group. In conclusion, retrograded rice had higher resistant starch levels compared with those of common rice powder, and it lowered body weight gain and improved lipid profiles and gut function in rats...|$|R

30|$|The {{four major}} {{ecosystems}} in rice farming differ {{in terms of}} the amount of water required to provide a successful growing environment and can be characterized as follows: (I) <b>the</b> irrigated <b>rice</b> ecosystem. This comprises approximately 55 % of <b>the</b> global <b>rice</b> land and produces 75 % of the world’s rice; (II) <b>the</b> rainfed lowland <b>rice</b> ecosystem. This comprises approximately 25 % of <b>the</b> global <b>rice</b> land and produces 17 % of global rice; (III) <b>the</b> upland <b>rice</b> ecosystem. This is typified by dry and infertile soil and makes-up approximately 13 % of <b>the</b> global <b>rice</b> land area and produces 4 % of global rice; and (IV) <b>the</b> flood-prone <b>rice</b> ecosystem. This is prevalent in South and Southeast Asia especially China, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Thailand. Flood-prone ecosystems comprise approximately 7 % of <b>the</b> global <b>rice</b> land area and produce 4 % of global rice. Flood-prone rice is found mainly in river delta areas where deep flooding to 50 – 400  m is common during the growing season. In this ecosystem, rice is planted before the rainy season and stems later elongate with the rising river water with sufficient vigor to keep the upper shoot above water level (IRRI 1997; Ito et al. 1999).|$|R

40|$|The {{changes in}} physical, {{rheological}} and enzyme-digestive behaviours of cooked white and brown rice, with similar amylose content, were investigated using a dynamic in vitro rat stomach (DIVRS) model and a static soaking method. <b>The</b> brown <b>rice</b> {{had a higher}} resistance on disintegration and lower gastric emptying rate with 53 % of <b>the</b> brown <b>rice</b> particles retained in the stomach at the end compared to 32 % for <b>the</b> white <b>rice.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> release rate of maltose from the starch hydrolysis was higher in <b>the</b> white <b>rice</b> throughout <b>the</b> digestion suggesting the lower glycemic potency of <b>the</b> brown <b>rice.</b> These differences could be contributed from the rigid bran layer in <b>the</b> brown <b>rice</b> which would inhibit the moisture absorption into rice kernels, limit textural degradation, and generate higher gastric digesta viscosity leading to lower mixing and mass transfer efficiency.
