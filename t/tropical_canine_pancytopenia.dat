2500|$|Ehrlichiosis ( [...] ; {{also known}} as canine rickettsiosis, canine hemorrhagic fever, canine typhus, tracker dog disease, [...] and <b>tropical</b> <b>canine</b> <b>pancytopenia</b> is a tick-borne disease of dogs usually caused by the {{organism}} Ehrlichia canis. Ehrlichia canis is the pathogen of animals. Humans can become infected by E. canis and other species after tick exposure. German Shepherd Dogs {{are thought to be}} susceptible to a particularly severe form of the disease, other breeds generally have milder clinical signs. Cats can also be infected.|$|E
40|$|An {{indirect}} fluorescent-antibody {{test for}} detection and titration of antibodies to Ehrlichia canis, the causative agent of <b>tropical</b> <b>canine</b> <b>pancytopenia,</b> has been described. The organism propagated by an in vitro technique in canine blood monocytes {{served as an}} antigen in the test. The specificity of the test was revealed by absence of cross-reactivity between the antigen and sera from dogs infected with various common pathogens and specific sera against eight rickettsial species. The accuracy of the test was ascertained by isolation of the organism from reactor dogs located in and outside the United States. Histopathological examination of nine reactor dogs revealed plasmacytosis of meninges and kidneys in eight of them...|$|E
40|$|Aim: As in India especially, the Punjab state sero-prevalence and {{distribution}} of ehrlichiosis in relation to clinico-hematobiochemical response remains largely unexplored. Thus, {{this study was designed}} to determine the prevalence of vector (tick) -borne <b>tropical</b> <b>canine</b> <b>pancytopenia</b> caused by Ehrlichia canis through enzyme labeled ImmunoComb® (IC) assay in dogs from in and around Ludhiana, Punjab. Correlation of prevalence was made with various clinico-hematobiochemical parameters. Materials and Methods: Seroprevalence study was carried out using IC® test kit (Biogal, Galed Labs). The study was conducted in 84 dogs presented to the Small Animal Clinics, Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, Punjab. Results: Out of 84 suspected dogs for ehrlichiosis, based on peripheral thin blood smear examination 12 (14. 28...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study of <b>canine</b> and feline <b>pancytopenia</b> presumably due to immune-mediated destruction of blood cell precursors in bone marrow {{was conducted to}} characterize the clinical signs, laboratory test results, treatment and outcome of this condition. CUHA case records between 1994 - 2004 were reviewed and animals {{were included in the}} study if they fulfilled the following criteria: several days history of pancytopenia, hyperplasia of one or more cell lines in the bone marrow, absence of morphologic abnormalities in bone marrow precursors, no evidence of peripheral destruction, and no known underlying disease or drug therapy that could have caused the <b>pancytopenia.</b> 	Seven <b>canine</b> and 4 feline cases were included. Animals were generally young and female, and exhibited vague clinical signs such as lethargy and anorexia. Bone marrow aspirates were hypercellular with erythroid hypoplasia in dogs and erythroid hyperplasia in cats. Both responded well to immunosuppressive therapy over days to weeks. Therefore, an innume-mediated pathogenesis should be considered for dogs and cats presenting with pancytopenia due to ineffective hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|Ehrlichia canis and canine granulocytic Ehrlichia sp. (CGE) infect canine monocytes and granulocytes, respectively. E. canis {{has been}} cultured in vitro {{and used to}} develop an {{immunofluorescence}} assay. CGE has not been cultured, and a serologic assay is not available. The sera of dogs infected with CGE were reported to react with E. canis by immunofluorescence. In this study, the temporal response of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified E. canis antigen in four dogs experimentally infected with E. canis, in two dogs experimentally infected with CGE, and in one dog infected with E. canis and subsequently infected with CGE. E. canis-infected dogs developed an IgG ELISA result of 1. 5 or greater for the optical density signal/noise ratio by 2 months postinfection. CGE challenge of a dog with a previous E. canis infection induced an anamnestic increase in the IgG ELISA result; however, CGE infection alone did not induce a significant IgG ELISA response. Western immunoblot analysis showed that dogs infected with E. canis developed antibodies initially that reacted with low-molecular-mass proteins (30, 24, and 21 kDa) and subsequently with higher-molecular-mass proteins (160, 100, 78, 64, 47, and 40 kDa). In contrast, CGE-infected dogs showed reactions with the same higher-molecular-mass proteins of E. canis but, unlike E. canis-infected dogs, not with the low-molecular-mass proteins of E. canis. Of 10 serum samples collected {{in the field of}} Indonesia from dogs with <b>tropical</b> <b>canine</b> <b>pancytopenia,</b> all had an optical density signal minus noise value of 2. 54 or greater in the IgG ELISA and reacted with E. canis antigen in a pattern similar to that of serum samples from dogs experimentally infected with E. canis in Western immunoblotting. This study suggests that the IgG ELISA and Western immunoblotting with purified E. canis as the antigen are useful in distinguishing between E. canis and CGE infections in dogs...|$|E
