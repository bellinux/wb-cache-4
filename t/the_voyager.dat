5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} of <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> missions, Jupiter's moons were {{arranged}} neatly into four groups of four, based on commonality of their orbital elements.

25|$|For 2014, the Lewis Conference {{was only}} able to secure one of their two {{expansion}} teams, however. The Governors played in the Lewis, but <b>the</b> <b>Voyagers</b> were needed in the Clark to restore competitive balance. Ironically, the two met in the 2014 Corps of Discovery Cup Championship. If events followed the preseason plans, these teams would have never matched up in an inter-conference title game. As it was, <b>the</b> <b>Voyagers</b> followed <b>the</b> same script as the Explorers the year before: play in the Clark Conference (on a one-year conditional basis), win the league championship, then switch conferences the very next season. One month after winning <b>the</b> Cup, <b>the</b> <b>Voyagers</b> officially became <b>the</b> sixth member of the Lewis Conference.|$|R
5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} as a vehicle to further explore Janeway's imagination and her social relationships, but critics disagreed on whether the storyline was appropriate for the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway Lambda one were never fully resolved due to lack of interest from fans of <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway Lambda one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|In November 1980, <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> 1 probe {{visited the}} Saturn system. It sent back the first {{high-resolution}} {{images of the}} planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of {{the atmosphere of the}} moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{estimates}} from <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed {{almost entirely of}} water ice. However, based {{on the effects of}} Enceladus's gravity on Cassini, its mass was determined to be much higher than previously thought, yielding a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Great Falls <b>Voyagers</b> are a {{minor league}} {{baseball}} team based in Great Falls, Montana. The team has played continuously in the Pioneer League since 1969, and previously played in the league from 1948 to 1963. <b>The</b> <b>Voyagers</b> have been <b>the</b> Advanced Rookie affiliate of the Chicago White Sox since 2003. Previously, the team was affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers (1984-2002), San Francisco Giants (1969-83), and Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers (1952-63). The team was not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team from 1964 to 1968. <b>The</b> <b>Voyagers</b> play their home games at Centene Stadium.|$|R

5|$|No other discoveries {{were made}} for almost another century. In 1948, Gerard Kuiper at the McDonald Observatory {{discovered}} the smallest and {{the last of the}} five large, spherical moons, Miranda. Decades later, the flyby of <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> 2 space probe in January 1986 led to the discovery of ten further inner moons. Another satellite, Perdita, was discovered in 1999 after studying old Voyager photographs.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{atmosphere}} {{exhibits a}} banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature {{used to describe}} these bands {{is the same as}} on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voyager</b> 2 probe {{observed}} in 1989 {{a handful of}} geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas and entrained dust from {{beneath the surface of}} Triton in plumes up to 8km high. Triton is thus, along with Earth, Io, and Enceladus, one of the few bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed. The best-observed examples are named Hili and Mahilani (after a Zulu water sprite and a Tongan sea spirit, respectively).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voyagers</b> flew {{a mission}} profile {{similar to the}} Pioneers, but were not spin stabilized. Instead, they {{required}} frequent firings of their thrusters for attitude control to stay aligned with Earth. Spacecraft like <b>the</b> <b>Voyagers</b> acquire small and unpredictable changes in speed as {{a side effect of}} the frequent attitude control firings. This 'noise' makes it impractical to measure small accelerations such as the Pioneer effect; accelerations as large as 10&minus;9 m/s2 would be undetectable.|$|R

50|$|On December 18, 2012, Pete Rose, Jr., the son {{of major}} league career hits leader Pete Rose, was named the Voyagers' manager. He {{replaced}} Ryan Newman. Under Rose Jr. <b>the</b> <b>Voyagers</b> held a 48-28 record and {{made it to the}} Pioneer League playoffs where they were eliminated by the Helena Brewers. On January 20, 2014 it was announced that then hitting coach Charlie Poe would manage <b>the</b> <b>Voyagers</b> for <b>the</b> 2014 season, ending Rose Jr.'s tenure as manager.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voyager</b> 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic {{activity on the}} moon Io was the greatest unexpected finding of the mission, {{as it was the}} first time an active volcano was observed on a celestial body other than Earth. Together, the Voyagers recorded the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, as well as evidence for other eruptions occurring between <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> encounters.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} a moon other than the Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably <b>the</b> <b>Voyager</b> 1 and 2 missions, saw a surge {{in the number of}} moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.|$|E
