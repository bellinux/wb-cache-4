25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: <b>The</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, Ford now {{offered a}} 4.2" [...] display between <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> {{tachometer}} on Premium models. Selections in this information display included G-force, acceleration times, air-fuel ratio, cylinder head temperature, and oil temperature. All models {{equipped with the}} 6-speed automatic transmission included a SelectShift feature, which provided drivers the ability to choose and hold a gear and to shift manually.|$|E
50|$|Metrication {{is mostly}} complete. Road signs solely use metric measurements, as do <b>the</b> <b>speedometers</b> <b>and</b> odometers in motor {{vehicles}} produced after 1974; There was no requirement for pre-1974 vehicles {{to have their}} <b>speedometers</b> <b>and</b> odometers converted to metric, so any remaining vehicles of this vintage will show miles. Privately imported vehicles, such as classic cars, also {{do not need to}} be so converted. The sale of oil and petrol is by the litre. However, vehicle tyre pressures are still commonly talked about in pounds per square inch.|$|R
2500|$|Also at mid-year, a new [...] "Fasten Seat Belts" [...] {{light with}} buzzer was added per Federal safety regulation. This light {{was located in}} <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> pod <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> was changed from {{displaying}} a high of , back to [...]|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>speedometer,</b> clock, <b>and</b> three-gauge {{cluster of}} oil pressure, fuel and ammeter, were set behind {{octagonal}} chrome frames, a subtle iteration of the MG badge theme later replicated in the MG TF.|$|R
2500|$|Regular fourth {{generation}} production began on January 3, 1983; the 1984 model year and delivery to customers began in March 1983. The 1984 model carried over the [...] L83 slightly more powerful (5bhp) [...] "Crossfire" [...] V8 engine {{from the final}} 1982 third generation model. New chassis features were aluminum brake calipers and an all-aluminum suspension for weight savings and rigidity. The new one piece targa top had no center reinforcement. A new electronic dashboard with digital liquid crystal displays for <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> tachometer was standard. Beginning in 1985, the [...] L98 engine with tuned port fuel injection became the standard engine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} on the Fairlane/Torino was all new for 1968. A new dashboard featured four equally sized round pods centred {{around the}} steering wheel. However, the pods {{did not contain}} {{a full set of}} gauges; rather an assortment of warning lights along with <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> fuel gauge. The fuel gauge and temperature warning lights were in the first pod, a [...] speedometer was located in the second pod from the left, alternator and oil pressure warning lights were in the third pod from the left and the fourth pod was blank. An optional tachometer was available, which would be located in the third pod, and an optional clock occupied the fourth pod. Ford offered many upholstery options, including a knitted vinyl option, called [...] "comfortweave." [...] This unique option allowed the vinyl to [...] "breathe" [...] unlike conventional vinyl, offering more comfort in hot weather. [...] Conforming to U.S. safety standards, there was much padding inside the Torino's interior, which also featured shoulder belts for front outboard passengers on all cars built after December 31, 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} the new , 9.5:1 compression ratio [...] six-cylinder engine with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor. It was VAM's second self-engineered engine, taking the Javelin up to performance levels of its V8 competition. The Go Pack version of this engine took the car to its zenith in terms of performance. The new engine was announced by two [...] "4.6" [...] emblems on both front fenders. The only other technical difference of the new version was a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for units equipped with automatic transmission. The interior saw more changes starting with all-new non-reclining high-back bucket seats with built-in [...] "J" [...] emblems on the seat backs {{as well as on}} the center of the rear seat back. The dashboard was restricted to the unit with woodgrain overlays only; the instrument cluster was once again completely different from the AMC Javelins. The right pod housed a clock and tachometer hybrid with the same design and appearance as the US Rallye Pak units, except that it was tuned for six cylinder engines. The center pod had a 240km/h speedometer, a range that put it on par as an equivalent to AMC's 140 MHP unit of the Rallye Pak; but the colors, graphics, and typography of the dial were the same as the standard gauges. This created a high contrast between <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> the clock/tack hybrid. On the left pod were the fuel and water temperature gauges with no oil pressure and ammeter gauges present. Like the AMC Javelins, the car now held a single dome light at the center of the headliner and a new brake pedal design for units with automatic transmission.|$|E

60|$|The great {{strike was}} over, the strikers beaten. Except that Vergil Gunch seemed less cordial, {{there were no}} visible effects of Babbitt's treachery to the clan. The oppressive fear of {{criticism}} was gone, but a diffident loneliness remained. Now he was so exhilarated that, to prove he wasn't, he droned about the office for fifteen minutes, looking at blue-prints, explaining to Miss McGoun that this Mrs. Scott wanted more money for her house--had raised the asking-price--raised it from seven thousand to eighty-five hundred--would Miss McGoun be sure and put {{it down on the}} card--Mrs. Scott's house--raise. When he had thus established himself as a person unemotional and interested only in business, he sauntered out. He took a particularly long time to start his car; he kicked the tires, dusted the glass of <b>the</b> <b>speedometer,</b> <b>and</b> tightened the screws holding the wind-shield spot-light.|$|E

5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> failed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{vehicle is}} within 7 years {{had less than}} 70,000 miles on it, upon proper proof of claim GM will reimburse the cost of repairs (parts and labor) up to the limit of what a GM {{dealership}} would have charged.|$|R
50|$|The {{dashboard}} {{retains its}} instrument layout, but adds a new instrument binnacle {{on the steering}} column for <b>the</b> <b>speedometer,</b> tachometer, <b>and</b> fuel gauge. The central instrument display now houses a four-line TFT display with the option to upgrade to an 8.8 inch screen for navigation and infotainment functions.|$|R

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture [¬© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] growing demands for high-quality products with improved specifications increase the requirements for condition monitoring and quality evaluation {{to ensure that no}} defective or below-specification products reach the customer. This paper presents a low-cost condition-monitoring system using acoustics to evaluate the quality of mechanically driven automotive speedometers during manufacture. Signal conditioning methods employ discrete cosine transformation to simplify the frequency spectrum of the signals. A novelty detection approach is optimized to characterize the 'normal' conditions of <b>the</b> <b>speedometers</b> <b>and</b> to reject any speedometers that are not so categorized {{on the basis of the}} sound waves produced from experimental running of <b>the</b> <b>speedometers.</b> <b>The</b> suggested techniques are found useful in developing an automated condition-monitoring system for deselecting low-quality automotive speedometers...|$|R
50|$|The Venom used Miller {{electrics}} up to 1962, with a belt-driven dynamo. After 1962 {{this was}} changed to a Lucas system. <b>The</b> <b>speedometer,</b> ammeter <b>and</b> light switch on the original Venoms were fitted into a steel headlamp nacelle; the optional rev counter {{had to go on}} a bracket. Later models with Thruxton forks had conventional headlamp brackets and separate instruments.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} cluster still contained <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> tachometer {{but a single}} digit LED gear indicator was added. It was in {{the centre of the}} instrument panel showing gear numbers 1 through 5 in a bright red colur. The neutral light indicator was retained as a separate item. Sales were 10,000+.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Cognitive capture=== Cognitive capture or, {{cognitive}} tunneling, is an inattentional blindness {{phenomenon in}} which the observer is too focused on instrumentation, task at hand, internal thought, etc. {{and not on the}} present environment. For example, while driving, a driver focused on <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> not on the road is suffering from cognitive capture.|$|E
5000|$|The Ram 100 model {{designation}} {{was dropped}} and these models folded {{back into the}} [...] "150" [...] range for 1990 due to the introduction and sales success of the Dodge Dakota pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the ammeter {{was replaced by a}} voltmeter while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> gauges.|$|E
50|$|On the {{instrumental}} panel {{there is an}} analog RPM meter in the centre, which contains a digital gear selector indicator. It also has a shift-light pre-programmed to light in three RPM ranges. <b>The</b> <b>speedometer</b> is digital, <b>and</b> there are two trip meters.|$|R
50|$|The {{overhead}} cam engines were upgraded in early 1972, the 1.6 becoming a 1.8 (1759 cc) and the 2.0 (1975 cc) twin carburettor became a 2.3 (2279 cc). At this time, the Viva 2300 SL and Firenza Sport SL {{did away with}} <b>the</b> letter-box <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> substituted an attractive seven-dial instrument pack. Firenza SLs had a two round-dial pack, though all other Vivas and Firenzas stuck with the original presentation.|$|R
5000|$|... 1981 was {{the first}} year {{electronic}} [...] "digital" [...] instrumentation was an available option.

5000|$|The Rekord B {{had come}} with a curious [...] "strip speedometer", {{featuring}} a coloured line that grew longer as speed increased, and which changed colour from green to yellow to red as the most common speed limit thresholds of 50 km/h and 100 km/h were crossed. Opinions were divided on <b>the</b> strip <b>speedometer,</b> <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> Rekord C Opel reverted to a conventional dial format speedometer, suggesting that for them too, the expanding colour changing strip speedometer {{had fallen out of}} fashion.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the new Civic likewise features major design changes. Unlike <b>the</b> split bi-level <b>speedometer</b> <b>and</b> tachometer of its predecessor, the tenth generation Civic consolidates these instruments into a fully customisable, all digital interface incorporating a 7-inch LCD screen positioned directly {{behind the steering wheel}} and in the driver's line of sight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} was considered [...] "surprisingly" [...] spacious for {{this class of}} car, with plenty of space for four, although the luggage locker under the front hood/bonnet offered only limited space: unlike the similarly configured competitor Renault Dauphine and Renault 8 (and Simca's own prototypes for the Simca 1000) which stowed their spare wheels flat underneath the front luggage locker, the Simca 1000 had its spare wheel stowed vertically in the front luggage compartment, just behind the front bumper. The driver enjoyed an excellent view out: <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> pod <b>and</b> minor controls positioned ahead of the driver were basic, although the manufacturer stressed that the glass covering <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> was angled to minimize reflections.|$|R
