25|$|As {{the race}} was heading into the closing stages, Hamilton {{seemed to be on}} a charge to try to catch the leading Brawn but in reality it looked only a mistake would stop the Brazilian winning. As Button was lapping a second off the pace just making sure his car got to the end. Kubica was {{catching}} Button at a high rate of knots but it seemed a long shot if Button was going to lose them two points. Barrichello took the chequered flag to win his first grand prix since the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in , and record the 100th win by a Brazilian driver in Formula One (including the victories of Emerson Fittipaldi, José Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Felipe Massa and Barrichello). Hamilton came second, while Finn Räikkönen came home in third. Kovalainen came fourth, while Nico Rosberg had a reasonably quiet race as he came home in fifth. Fernando Alonso came sixth in his home race, championship leader Jenson Button came seventh, while Robert Kubica came eighth, only his second points scoring finish so far this season. Neither Red Bull's Vettel or Webber scored a point, while Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers championship. Button kept his lead although he only added two points to his tally. Brawn edged further ahead in the constructors' championship by scoring 12 points with Red Bull not scoring a single point <b>this</b> <b>weekend.</b>|$|E
25|$|With star players, Landry Jones, Ryan Broyles, and Travis Lewis {{coming back}} for the 2011 season, there were high {{expectations}} for Bob Stoops and his Sooner football team. Stoops hired former Sooners quarterback Josh Heupel as offensive coordinator to replace the departed Wilson. OU began the season ranked #1 in both the AP and Coaches polls. The Sooners became the first teams {{to reach the top}} ranking in the Associated Press poll 100 times since the poll began in 1936. Under Stoops, OU has been ranked No. 1 more weeks than they have not been ranked in the top 25. They were able to accomplish this feat without even stepping foot on the field, as they had their bye week <b>this</b> <b>weekend.</b> Their early season match-up with fellow top five team Florida State proved to test the Sooners, as they looked to prove that their #1 ranking was warranted. As the Sooners played well the first few weeks the Sooners were thought {{to be out of the}} National Title race with a heartbreaking loss to the unranked Texas Tech Red Raiders snapping a school-record 39game home win streak. However, the Sooners bounced back the following. few weeks to become ranked fifth in the country despite losing star receiver Ryan Broyles only to lose to Baylor for the first time in school history. They stayed in the hunt for a share of the conference title and a Fiesta Bowl appearance until losing to in-state rival Oklahoma State in the last game of the season. They finished the regular season 9–3 and went on to defeat Iowa 31-14 in the Insight Bowl.|$|E

500|$|Although Game of Thrones was {{dismissed}} by some critics before it began, its {{success has been}} credited {{with an increase in}} the popularity of fantasy themes. On the eve of the second season's premiere, a CNN.com blog post by Joel Williams read, [...] "After <b>this</b> <b>weekend,</b> you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy" [...] and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's 2001 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and the Harry Potter films establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are [...] "gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture". Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who {{finished}} second, said [...] "Hats off to Mike (Ford, crew chief) {{and this whole}} FedEx Office Camry team.

I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep <b>this</b> <b>weekend</b> -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane.

500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have seen in the past though we have had fights {{and most of the time}} I was really gentle, and <b>this</b> <b>weekend</b> I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E
500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here. That’s what it takes to run at this level, {{to be a part of}} that Chase, if we can go and continue to have as much fun as we did <b>this</b> <b>weekend.</b> I know it’s the key, I know it is to my success." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{the lyrics of}} All Hands on the Bad One feature personal, political, and social themes. The first song, [...] "The Ballad of the Ladyman", is a {{deliberate}} attempt to mock those who misunderstand the band. Tucker said that the song is [...] "almost making fun of how people see us, how people see what you're supposed to be when you're a woman in rock." [...] The song was inspired when the band was invited to the Bowlie Weekender music festival in England in 1999. Tucker explained, [...] "We were all staying in little chalets or whatever and we had our own cabin and we were cabin 216. Someone wrote this message to us that was like, 'Cabin 216 ladymen.' And we were like, 'What?' It {{was meant to be}} a funny thing, but in this other way, it was really this naming of us. It was a subtle way of saying, 'Oh, you're different because you're a woman band and because you're in some ways political.' It's still seen as threatening to people. It's not like we had <b>this</b> <b>weekend</b> where we just relaxed with everyone and just hung out." [...] Kat Iudicello, writing for PopMatters, stated that the song [...] "sports sweet harmonies, a slow anger and soft, low bitterness, and driving steady guitars and drums." ...|$|E
