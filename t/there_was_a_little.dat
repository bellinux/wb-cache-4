5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though {{six of the}} team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not {{out at the end}} of the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E

25|$|During Ottoman occupation, the sanjak had a {{military}} administration. Due to good behaviour of the rayah, the inhabitants were exempt from war taxes.

The town was divided into two parts, a Turkish and a Serbian. The Turkish part was fenced and closed, while the Serbian one was open. On the main square {{there was a large}} mosque built and inside the fortress <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> one. There was a Turkish bath, and around it there were about twenty stores. Gradnulica was a disorderly village, whose centre was approximately on the crossroad of the present streets Sindjelićeva and Djurdjevska. Prior to Ottoman occupation, the citizens were Serbs. At the end of the 18th century there were about fifty Turk families.|$|E

Afterwards, Agustín Ross installed amenities such as a laundry, stables, and stairways, among others, according to local historian José Arraño Acevedo, turning Pichilemu into a summer resort town for affluent people from Santiago and Mendoza, Argentina.|$|E
500|$|In September 2017, {{more than}} two decades after the episode aired for the first time, an {{earthquake}} devastated Mexico City on the state of Mexico. Then during the news coverage of the devastation, Televisa reported <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl named Frida Sofia trapped within the debris of a fallen school. However, soon after it was revealed that in fact Frida Sofia never existed. Outraged with the fake news within times of crisis, rival network TV Azteca television schedule of the day included The Simpsons. In retaliation, TV Azteca decided to air that same day the episode of Radio Bart (informally known in Mexico as [...] "the Timmy O'Toole episode"). Such airing choice was praised by their viewers and international news media alike, leading to Timmy O'Toole to become a trending topic in social media, with the Mexican people explaining their support trough internet memes.|$|E

The realistic design of the new puppets has been praised by Vincent Terrace and criticised by others. Certain members of the production staff had the impression that they lacked the charm of the earlier generation of puppets due to the authentic proportions that were now being used. Director David Lane's initial thoughts on a prototype, sculpted by head puppet-maker John Brown, were, [...] "it was as if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dead person in ... because it was perfect in all its proportions it just looked odd." [...] Brown remembers placing the prototype next to the Lady Penelope puppet from Thunderbirds and gauging the response from colleagues: [...] "When they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn't like it, some did." [...] Commentators have noted that facial expression was sacrificed in favour of a realistic design, a result on which Terry Curtis remembers: ...|$|E

500|$|Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having {{first met}} at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu's musical ideas {{began to develop}} and the first {{incarnation}} of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don’t know why. Maybe <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> spark with Win." [...] The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live {{in the second half}} of 2001. At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kyle (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003).|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Superunknown {{captured}} the metal influences of the band's previous works while showcasing the group's newly evolving style. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} band's [...] "earlier punk influences are rarely detectable, replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia." [...] Cornell labeled the album as more [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "versatile" [...] than the band's previous releases. The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band's previous recordings, with some songs having a Middle-Eastern or Indian flavor (for example [...] "Half", sung by Shepherd). Some songs also show a Beatles influence, such as [...] "Head Down" [...] and [...] "Black Hole Sun". In a 1994 interview with Guitar World, Thayil explained, [...] "We looked deep down inside {{the very core of}} our souls and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Ringo sitting there. Oh sure, we like telling people it's John Lennon or George Harrison; but when you really look deep inside of Soundgarden, there's a little Ringo wanting to get out." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron said that the experimentation on the album was [...] "just a matter of refinement." [...] According to The A.V. Club, the album [...] "both redefined and transcended grunge". Michael Beinhorn stated that to achieve the intensity of Superunknown, he sought influence from European electronic music, such as the British Aphex Twin and the Dutch genre of Gabber, described by him as [...] "some of the rawest music made".|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
