5|$|One of the surprises of {{the impacts}} was {{the small amount}} of water {{revealed}} compared to prior predictions. Before the impact, models of Jupiter's atmosphere had indicated that the break-up of the largest fragments would occur at atmospheric pressures of anywhere from 30 kilopascals <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tens of megapascals (from 0.3 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred bar), with some predictions that the comet would penetrate a layer of water and create a bluish shroud over that region of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not {{believed to be a}} threat to the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E

They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective for up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as {{the percentage of}} women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year, and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{research}} on live coral species is limited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> studied species. Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations {{that is much}} simpler to physically extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, {{which happens to be}} one of the only multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, {{the line}} lay unused and in disrepair, but the riveted-steel {{elevated}} structure was structurally sound. Around this time, the structure became known <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs, and rugged trees such as sumac that had {{sprung up in}} the gravel along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks. These eruptions wear down the lava dome holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian {{activity is}} lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of pyroclastic material down the volcano's slope.|$|E

5|$|Originally, most news {{articles}} {{published by the}} website were relayed from other technology-related websites. Ars Technica provided short commentary on the news, generally a few paragraphs, and {{a link to the}} original source. After being purchased by Condé Nast, Ars Technica began publishing more original news, investigating topics, and interviewing sources themselves. A significant portion of the news {{articles published}} there now are original. Relayed news is still published on the website, ranging from one or two sentences <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> paragraphs.|$|E
