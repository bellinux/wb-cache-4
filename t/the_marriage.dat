5|$|One {{factor in}} William's favour was his {{marriage}} to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders. The union was arranged in 1049, but Pope Leo IX forbade <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> at the Council of Rheims in October 1049. <b>The</b> <b>marriage</b> nevertheless went ahead {{some time in the}} early 1050s, possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal sanction was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier. Papal sanction of <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen– one by William and one by Matilda. <b>The</b> <b>marriage</b> was important in bolstering William's status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors. Contemporary writers considered <b>the</b> <b>marriage,</b> which produced four sons and five or six daughters, to be a success.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} <b>the</b> theme of <b>marriage</b> in George Eliot s novel Middlemarch. It uses {{narrative}} theory {{to explore the}} power balance and happiness of <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> through <b>the</b> portrayal by the narrator. The thesis proves {{that there is a}} struggle for power in all of <b>the</b> <b>marriages,</b> and that <b>the</b> representation of these struggles follows a clear pattern: where the power balance appears to be set, <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> are portrayed as happy and successful, and where the power balance is not set, <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> are portrayed as unhappy and unsuccessful The factors used are economic, emotional and intellectual power, and here the historical context has been considered. <b>The</b> theme of <b>marriage</b> has seldom been studied, and never in this particular manner, including all <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> that are portrayed in the novel. Through this study it becomes evident that <b>the</b> theme of <b>marriage</b> is important in the novel, and that many characters have been misunderstood in the past...|$|R

5|$|The same year, George {{married his}} first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby {{securing}} additional incomes {{that would have}} been outside Salic laws. <b>The</b> <b>marriage</b> of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother was at first against <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's mother (who was not of royal birth), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in <b>the</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it may be that <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via <b>the</b> <b>marriage,</b> was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E

50|$|City {{officials}} in San Francisco claimed that although <b>the</b> 2004 <b>marriages</b> were prohibited by state law, {{the state law}} was invalidated by the Equal Protection Clause.

However, legislators and groups opposing same-sex marriages quickly reacted, filing a suit and requesting {{a court order to}} prevent the city from performing the ceremonies. Additionally, the California state agency that records marriages stated that altered forms, including any marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples, would not be registered. The legal validity of <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> was tested in the courts, and <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> were ultimately voided by the state Supreme Court.|$|R

5|$|After the king's {{death on}} June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. <b>The</b> <b>marriage</b> was {{important}} for Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> was a guarantee for Helmichis of the loyalty of the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Aigusta {{was baptized}} as Anastasia {{in order to}} marry Simeon of Russia in 1333; he became Grand Prince of Moscow in 1341. There is no direct {{evidence}} {{that she was a}} daughter of Gediminas, but because <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> was high-profile, most historians have concluded that {{she was a member of}} Gediminas' family. <b>The</b> <b>marriage</b> had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in Ruthenia, but conflicts broke out again in 1335, just two years after <b>the</b> <b>marriage.</b> Her two sons Vasilei and Konstantin did not survive infancy; her daughter Vasilisa married Mikhail Vasilevich of Kashin, a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania. Her brother Jaunutis sought her help when he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345. Immediately before her death on 11 March 1345 Aigusta became a nun. She was buried within the Moscow Kremlin at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored.|$|E
