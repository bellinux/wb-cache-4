Reputable breeders should be able to show documentation of health screening performed on their breeding dogs. Note that Pharaohs, like most sighthounds, are sensitive to barbiturate anaesthetics.

2500|$|Stylistically, Rosenthal {{attempted}} {{to recreate the}} elements and themes of the original film. The opening title features a jack-o'-lantern that splits in half to reveal a human skull. In the original, the camera zoomed in on the jack-o'-lantern's left eye. [...] The first scene {{of the film is}} presented through a first-person camera format in which a voyeuristic Michael Myers enters an elderly couple's home and steals a knife from the kitchen. Rosenthal attempts to reproduce the [...] "jump" [...] scenes present in Halloween, but does not film Myers on the periphery, which is where he appeared in many of the scenes of the original. Under Rosenthal's direction, Myers is the central feature of a majority of the scenes. In an interview with Luke Ford, Rosenthal explains,The first movie I ever did [...] was a sequel, but {{it was supposed to be}} a direct continuation.

The {{document}} is {{a record of the}} names of all those places mentioned above, where Hitchen met the thieves and organised crimes with them. It also gives the examples of social details, one of which explains how Lord Barnard's bills through a chain of accidents appeared in Hitchen's hands. If one did not tip the porter in the General Post Office, he would throw the letter out. Pickpockets, visiting the Office for their own purpose in the midnight, saw the other one at the door with the bills inside. Seeing the boys with the papers on the one side of the tavern and a sad victim on the other, set Hitchen to assist him. Certainly, this rather comic justification with others added to his main reason of being maliciously persecuted by the robbers was not to blindfold the Court of Aldermen, who were reluctant to take decision against him anyway for the clear reasons discussed above. On the other hand, they could not utterly ignore the Lord Mayor's reminder to the committee, that marshal's behaviour humiliated the City and reflected other officers' behaviour under the Mayor. All they did, though, was rather cynical. After waiting for Hitchen's written defence, presented itself as late as 16 December, they did not read it until 16 January 1713. As for their decision on marshal's suspension, it came over five months late, that was 24 June 1713 and [...] "forbade him attendance on the Lord Mayor" [...] while retaining his power as a constable to obtain warrant when needed and apprehend.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw {{gave the}} film four stars in September 2001, {{choosing}} {{it as the}} best film of the week.

[...] He notes that, among [...] "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of Battle Royale is not a satire of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." [...] He concluded that, while some [...] "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it [...] "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling." [...] Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus [...] gave it a B+ rating and called it [...] "a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone." [...] British critic Jonathan Ross stated that [...] "if you want to catch a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then I suggest you <b>try</b> <b>hard</b> not to miss it" [...] and concluded that [...] "it's a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie." [...] In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had seen in the past two decades, stating that, [...] "If there’s any movie that’s been made since I’ve been making movies that I wish I had made, it’s that one." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Franklin's {{themes in}} writing about Vietnam is that the {{supposed}} existence of surviving American prisoners of war in Vietnam after the war was a myth created after 1980 with the tacit approval of the Reagan administration, and that the psychological foundations of the myth arguably originated from justifications for the war offered by the Nixon before 1973, in that the war had to continue {{in order to bring}} the prisoners of war home. In the 1980s and 1990s, many Americans believed, incorrectly, that there were many [...] "prisoners of war are still being held in Indochina" [...] and that the American government was lying to the public about their existence. When Franklin was assembling an anthology in 1996 entitled The Vietnam War in American Stories, Songs and Poems, he sent a fax to musician Bruce Springsteen requesting the singer's permission to put the song Born in the U.S.A. in his anthology; he faxed the request en route to class, and Springsteen's office faxed back, agreeing, letting him use the image without charge. His book Vietnam and America: A Documented History, which he co-edited with his wife Jane Franklin and Marvin Gettleman and Marilyn Young, was described by The New York Times as a [...] "valuable anthology of crucial texts and records" [...] which [...] "tersely replays the bitter conflict." [...] A reviewer in The Nation described Franklin's writing about the M.I.A. issue as using [...] "elegant economy". Franklin believed that his students had incorrect ideas about the American involvement in Vietnam, such as that the United States lost the war because it [...] "didn't <b>try</b> <b>hard</b> enough"; Franklin felt that his students were unaware of the extent of bomb damage. His book chronicled how the supposed [...] "missing" [...] American soldiers were [...] "known to be dead" [...] but were [...] "kept alive for bureaucratic reasons that backfired."
