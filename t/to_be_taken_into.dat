Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account, including {{the preservation of}} historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.|$|E
5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E
5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E

A flashback reveals {{the cause of this}} rift: Cecil had auditioned to become the new sidekick for Krusty the Clown, a job he had long desired, but Bob, who had not originally intended to be the sidekick, was chosen instead. Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer, employs Bob to supervise the construction of a hydroelectric dam in a river near Springfield, while Bart, believing that Bob is still evil, continuously follows him around. Bob begins to become intensely annoyed by Bart's intrusions into his personal life and the dam's incompetent laborers (Cletus and his family), and he expresses a desire to see the dam burst and obliterate Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Li, Ah Jong, and Jennie wait in {{a church}} for Fung Sei to return with Ah Jong's money. Fung Sei arrives with the money, horribly beaten by Wong Hoi's gangsters who have {{followed}} him. He is mortally wounded when the hitmen barge into the church. After Ah Jong ends Fung Sei's misery with a mercy killing, he and Li engage in a long and bloody shootout with the Triad all over the church. The battle ends with a Mexican standoff between Ah Jong, Li and Wong Hoi. Ah Jong manages to wound Wong Hoi, but the Triad leader lands two bullets in Ah Jong's eye sockets before the latter dies of his wounds. When a police squadron arrives in the scene, Wong Hoi begs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> custody. Frustrated by {{the outcome of the}} battle, Li fatally shoots Wong Hoi. But afterwards, Li is humiliated and arrested by the police who all have witnessed his misconduct. Worst of all, he is terminated from his career. As the result, he mourns Ah Jong while facing prison. In the end nobody ends happily.|$|E

The following day, the inspectorate gave permission for the trains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use, despite noting a series of non-conformities with safety regulations: the inspectorate lacked a list of the train's deviations from the safety regulations; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains, particularly when automatic train stop was disconnected; lack of safety training for the crew; lack of an evacuation analysis; and lack of control of the marking of safety equipment. Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks. Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical.|$|E

5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent the human eye. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> account in the rendering. Refraction effects were added to make light account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E
