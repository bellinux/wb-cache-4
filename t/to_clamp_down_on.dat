5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the martial law.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{was first}} created in 1912 for {{occupation}} duties in Cuba. Earlier that year, the Negro Rebellion had erupted throughout Cuba among former black slaves. A 1st Provisional Marine Regiment of 450 men under Colonel Lincoln Karmany was assembled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 22 May. At the same time, a 2nd Provisional Marine Regiment of 750 men under Colonel James Mahoney assembled at Key West, Florida. The two regiments sailed for Cuba aboard the USS Prairie, with 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment, landing at Havana {{and the remainder}} of the force at Guantanamo. There they combined to form the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in early June under Karmany, and the United States Marines fanned out in Oriente Province, occupying 26 towns and controlling all rail traffic in the area. The Marines protected United States sugar plantations in Siboney and El Cobre until late July when the Cuban government was able <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the revolt. At that point, the Marines pulled back to Guantanamo, disbanded the brigade and returned home.|$|E

5|$|The 2002–03 {{season began}} with the same {{optimism}} that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game, suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto, and Wilkens' laissez-faire attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury. Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history not to dress 12 players for a single game in a season. Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach, with his loss total getting dangerously close to his win total. The Raptors ended {{the season with a}} 24–58 record and Wilkens was fired. This {{turned out to be a}} blessing in disguise, when the Raptors were given the 4th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he {{implemented}} {{measures to}} increase {{freedom of the}} press (glasnost) and economic decentralization (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control. Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating. When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies for Cuba. Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to set an example {{for the rest of the}} populace. Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.|$|E

He advocated an interpretation of Islam known as Islam Hadhari, which advocates the intercompatibility between Islam and economic and technological development. His administration emphasised a revival of the Malaysian agricultural sector.|$|E
25|$|Faced with {{opposition}} from the Conservative government, and a Private Members Bill <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> unlicensed parties, Staines, along with Tony Colston-Hayter, established the Freedom to Party Campaign at the Conservative Party conference in October 1989. Although the campaign had little impact, with a first rally in Trafalgar Square attracting 4,000, and a second 10,000, Staines was still occasionally active {{in his role as}} director of the campaign, arguing in 1995 that individuals {{should have the right to}} have occasional noisy parties at home.|$|E

Duca's assassination by an Iron Guard death squad, the authorities decided <b>to</b> also <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the PSDR press. Deep rifts were also showing between the orthodox Marxism of Petrescu and Moscovici and the more reformist stance of Transylvanian socialists.|$|R
5000|$|While oathing, for {{practical}} reasons, within the Pipeline {{was reduced to}} an absolute minimum, as many new initiates as possible were oathed. A newcomer who refused to take the oath often faced the same fate as a recalcitrant outside the camps: they were murdered. [...] "The detainees would strangle them with their blankets or, using blades fashioned from the corrugated-iron roofs {{of some of the}} barracks, would slit their throats", writes Elkins. The camp authorities' preferred method of capital punishment was public hanging.

25|$|On March 24, 1976, the {{democratic}} government was toppled {{by a military}} coup. It opened one of the darkest political chapters in Argentina's history, full of repression, fear, and missing citizens. Argentine rock by no means would be immune to the military crackdown, and would suffer the worst period of censorship in its history. Rock was seen as subversive by the nation's authority figures, who began <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the music. In a 1976 speech, Admiral Emilio Massera denounced rock musicians and fans as potential subversives and repression of them began in 1977. Before {{the end of the}} decade, rock had gone increasingly underground.|$|E
25|$|The Ming navy began <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{smuggling}} {{activities in}} 1543, but the Xu syndicate {{was able to}} repulse the Ming attacks in Shuangyu {{with the aid of}} Portuguese firepower. Hardened by their victories against the Ming navy, the smugglers expanded their network of activities down the coast of China all the way to Guangdong and inland to the metropolis of Nanjing, with Shuangyu being their hub. In 1544, this network was further expanded when Wang Zhi joined the Xu syndicate, bringing along his Japanese connections to Shuangyu. Thus Shuangyu reached its zenith as the biggest entrepôt in maritime East Asia trading goods from Europe and Asia until its downfall in 1548.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} May, the {{government}} replaced Kuhn with Lanther, who immediately announced a prohibition on openly bearing arms. At the same time, he also announced {{that the value of}} the remaining feudal titles would be bought out, and that this process was to be completed by January 1803. While such a buy-out would in practice abolish those titles and the associated taxes, it remained unclear whether the buying back was to be done by the canton, or the peasants. Because of the lack of clarity, the countryside remained agitated, and over the following weeks, {{the government}} enjoined Lanther <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> firmly <b>on</b> the population.|$|R

The Kibaki government dismissed the idea of early elections, and claimed that such gatherings were a [...] "threat to national security". The opposition encouraged nationwide pro-election demonstrations and scheduled an Orange team led rally at Mombasa Municipal Stadium for 10 December. The government called in police to seal off access the Stadium and prevent the rally from taking place. All other pro-election rallies throughout the country were <b>to</b> be <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> by law enforcement.

25|$|Trade {{unions and}} {{collective}} bargaining were outlawed from {{no later than}} {{the middle of the}} 14th century when the Ordinance of Labourers was enacted in the Kingdom of England. As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the government began <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> what it saw as the danger of popular unrest {{at the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars. In 1799, the Combination Act was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as Luddism and had been prominent in struggles such as the 1820 Rising in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a general strike, which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the Combination Act 1825 severely restricted their activity.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{dimension to}} misrepresentations is the statutory regulation of business, and enforcement measures by the Office of Fair Trading against unfair trade practices. Typically consumers {{do not understand}} legal complexities and {{have little incentive to}} litigate over small claims. Statute may also strengthen enforcement of consumer protection by providing criminal or regulatory sanctions. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 ss 1-4 say that not only false, but also misleading statements about products are prohibited. An early example is found in Robertson v Dicicco where it was held that describing a vehicle as a ‘beautiful car’ was implicitly saying it was fit for purpose. Though the exterior was attractive, it was still a misrepresentation when the car did not work. Similarly the Consumer Protection Act 1987 ss 20-21 create an offence for giving misleading information about the prices of goods and services, such as banking or insurance. On top of this the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, give a broad principle based jurisdiction to courts and the OFT <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> misleading practices or omissions by businesses.|$|E
25|$|After {{signing the}} Renville Agreement in 1948, {{many of the}} Republican armed units {{returned}} from zones of conflict. This gave the Indonesian right-wing some confidence {{that they would be}} able to counter PKI militarily. Guerrilla units and militias under the influence of PKI were ordered to disband. In Madiun a group PKI militaries refused to go along with the disarmament were killed in September the same year. The killings sparked a violent uprising. This provided a pretext <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the PKI. It was claimed by army sources that PKI had announced the proclamation of the 'Soviet Republic of Indonesia' on 18 September with Musso as its president and Amir Sjarifuddin as its prime minister. At the same time PKI had denounced the uprising and appealed for calm. The uprising was suppressed by republican troops and PKI passed through yet another period of repression. On 30 September Madiun was taken over by republican troops of the Siliwangi division. Thousands of party cadres were killed and 36 000 were imprisoned. Amongst the executed were several leaders including Musso who was killed on 31 October, allegedly while trying to escape from prison. Aidit and Lukman went into exile in the People's Republic of China. However, PKI was not banned and continued to function. The reconstruction of the party began in 1949.|$|E

That same year, a riot during Madison's Halloween festivities prompted police <b>to</b> begin systematically <b>clamping</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Mifflin event. The city has consistently refused proposals by students to close the street and revive the block party under student control. A Madison police lieutenant was quoted as saying, [...] "Quite frankly, we wish this event would go away." [...] Since 2002, there have been an increased number of arrests {{and a decrease in}} attendance. The majority of arrests are for alcohol-related incidents.|$|R
50|$|The stamper {{was next}} trimmed to size, {{and the back}} sanded smooth, to ensure a smooth finish to the mouldings, and improve contact between the stamper and the press die. The edge was then pressed {{hydraulically}} to form another lip <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> the edge <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the press. The stampers would be used in hydraulic presses to mould the LP discs. The advantages of this system over the earlier more-direct system included ability to make {{a large number of}} records quickly by using multiple stampers. Also, more records could be produced from each master since stampers would eventually get damaged, but rarely wear out.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese {{investigation}} also {{uncovered the}} extent of the corruption involving foreign trade by Lai En and his henchmen. For these reasons, the port of Ningbo was closed to foreign trade, but Lai En retained his post until 1527 and actually had his powers expanded to deal with military emergencies. Although Japan continued to send tributary fleets to Ningbo, only two more (sent by the Ōuchi) were received in 1540 and 1549, after which the downfall of the Ōuchi family ended the official Ming-Japan trade. The cessation of foreign trade at Ningbo turned local merchants wishing to trade with the Japanese and other foreigners to engage in illicit trading on the offshore islands like Shuangyu. Some Chinese merchants and influential families began to owe the foreigners huge sums of debt {{as a result of this}} unregulated trade, which they would try to clear by informing the authorities <b>to</b> militarily <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the illegal trade centers. To protect their goods and recover their losses, the participants of the foreign trade armed themselves against the Ming military and engaged in piratical and smuggling activities. This led to the widespread Jiajing wokou raids that terrorized the coast of China in the 1550s.|$|R
25|$|Chinese {{human rights}} activist Huang Qi was also detained. Huang Qi is an active rights defender in China. he {{established}} an Internet service company in October 1998 to help search for missing people, and launched a website called Tianwang Xunren on June 4, 1999. Huang Qi was arrested on June 3, 2000, and sentenced to five years imprisonment on May 9, 2003 by the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court for the crime of inciting subversion of state power. During the Sichuan Earthquake, Huang Qi's work and his website were widely reported by media to help find missing people to unite family members. He also wrote many articles about families who lost their children. Although initially tolerating independent reporting, China's security forces have begun <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> dissent and public complaints. According to Human Rights In China, sources inside China said that {{on the evening of}} June 10, 2008, Huang Qi, Pu Fei, a volunteer for Tianwang, and Zuo Xiaohuan, a former teacher at Leshan Teachers College were missing after they were forced into a car by unidentified individuals. In the afternoon of June 12, 2008, Lawyer Xu, Tianwang's legal counsel, went to the Jinyang Police Station of Chengdu to file a missing persons report. The police reportedly told Xu that Huang Qi has been detained, and that the related legal procedure notice would be sent to his family but refused to disclose the grounds for Huang's detention. Huang Qi's 74-year-old mother, Pu Wenqing, said that the family had not received any notice from the police over the past few days.|$|E

40|$|China's {{fight against}} {{corruption}} appears to have reached a stalemate. The fluctuation {{in the number of}} corruption prosecution, which was a characteristic of the official statistics until the early 1990 s, has virtually vanished. Instead, one sees flat lines. The stalemate is surprising given the ideological and organizational adaptation in the fight of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against corruption. Ideologically, the CCP has enhanced its anti-corruption rhetoric and appears more determined than ever to control the spread of corruption. Organizationally, the CCP has increased investment in the anti-corruption establishment and provided additional financial and human resources to anti-corruption institutions. The high profile prosecution of high ranking officials in recent years and the imposition of harsh sentencing, including execution, contrast sharply with the larger institutional inertia. This paper examines anti-corruption enforcement in China. The CCP is taking a hands-on approach in tackling corruption and appears determined <b>to</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>down</b> hard <b>on</b> corruption, as demonstrated by the increase in prosecution of large-scaled corruption cases involving top CCP officials and the institutional renovation, though limited and piecemeal. However, {{it is clear that the}} anti-corruption action is taken largely by the CCP's anti-corruption central authority, the Central Committee of Disciplinary Inspection (CCDI). The CCDI takes direct action because local anti-corruption authorities are unable and unwilling to play an effective role...|$|R
5000|$|The investigative {{journalist}} William Thomas Stead of the Pall Mall Gazette was pivotal in exposing {{the problem of}} child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he [...] "purchased" [...] one victim, Eliza Armstrong, the 13-year-old daughter of a chimney sweep, for five pounds and {{took her to a}} brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four exposés entitled The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon, which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental [...] "pleasure palaces". The [...] "Maiden Tribute" [...] was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt, pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to Hyde Park demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, which raised the age of consent <b>to</b> 16 and <b>clamped</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> prostitution.|$|R
