40|$|Objectives: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore and {{describe}} <b>the</b> familycentredness and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>planning</b> procedure for children and youth with cerebral palsy (CP) in Finland. The main focus was on how professionals working with children and youth with cerebral palsy describe and document <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>planning</b> procedure and how family-centredness was perceived by professionals and parents. Methods: Participants were team members in neuropediatric multidisciplinary teams in central and university hospitals and government special schools as well as physiotherapy private practitioners who had {{an agreement with the}} Social Insurance Institution. Parents visiting two university hospital neuropediatric wards participated in one study (II). Family-centredness in services (FCS) was evaluated by the Measure of Processes of Care questionnaires. To get a deeper insight in <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>planning</b> procedure, focus group interviews were conducted. Two researchers conducted the interviews which were tape recorded and transcribed. Three content areas guided the interviews: goal-setting, different transition phases {{and the use of the}} International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, Children and Youth version. A retrospective cross-sectional register study was used to analyze the interrelation between needs and functional difficulties and the therapeutic goals in written <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plans.</b> <b>The</b> ICF-CY was used as a reference in the analysis. Results: Professionals and parents rated the family-centred service as fair to moderate. There was a significant difference in how professionals of different disciplines rated their FCS delivery. Professionals with more than 25 years of work experience in <b>the</b> field of <b>rehabilitation</b> for children and youth with CP rated their service higher than those with shorter work experience. Parents and professionals identified common aspects in need of development, i. e. letting the family choose when and what kind of information is provided as well as providing opportunities for the whole family to obtain information. Goal setting and ways to involve families in <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>planning</b> procedure was experienced as challenging. Collaboration with all involved in <b>the</b> child´s <b>rehabilitation</b> was partly scanty and the results indicate a lack of routines in the transition phases. In <b>the</b> written <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plans</b> <b>the</b> goals were not well reflected in the children´s needs and functional difficulties. Conclusion: This thesis identified examples in <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>planning</b> procedure of good practice in which collaboration with various parties and clear formal processes occurred. Areas in need of development were also identified. Standardized formal programme processes and policies and a named care manager for all families could provide a starting point in developing and improving the services to ensure all families have the possibility to be involved in their child´s rehabilitation service...|$|R

This is a step backward," [...] said a Hong Kong-based credit analyst at a European bank. The analyst, like his many of colleagues in the industry based outside Bangkok, see the resolution of the TPI case as a litmus test for the restructuring of billions of dollars worth of Thai corporate debt and crucial to Thailand's ability to attract and retain foreign investment. Observers, based in the Thai capital, however, are more tempered. [...] "The TPI case is very unique," [...] Kowit explains. [...] "First the amount involved, US$3.8 billion, is huge. Second, the company's labour union have mostly supported Prachai is very strong. And lastly, the creditor side involves some of the largest domestic and foreign institutions." [...] Kowit also says many in Thailand were surprised that <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plan</b> did not permit any haircuts and that the creditors could take 75 percent equity in the company through conversion of accrued interest of US$756 million in only three years. Prachai has repeatedly accused the lenders of not paying enough attention to the long-term viability of the company and focusing primarily on maximizing short-term returns. Speaking after the 13 June judgment, Kitti Limsakul, the advisor to Thailand's finance minister, told Dow Jones Newswires that an earlier proposal to set up a 15-member tripartite debt administration team consisting of seven members each from the creditor and debtor side, headed by a mediator from the government had been modified. Now, the finance ministry is willing to permit unequal representation of the two sides, depending on who is suitable. With the 2005 ruling, Prachai was forced to sell his and his family's stock at 70 percent below the market price at 3.30 baht per share to the recently privatized petroleum corporation PTT Public Company Limited (PTT).

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore how}} <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plan</b> {{influences}} the rehabilitation process and its outcome {{in people with}} late effects of polio participating in an individualised goal-oriented interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. Methods: Four women and two men with late effects of polio were interviewed before rehabilitation, at discharge, and at follow-up. Data were analysed according to the constant comparative method of grounded theory. Findings: The participants' experiences formed one core category: The same starting point but different rehabilitation processes. Before rehabilitation, all participants experienced a similar starting point: Naive understanding of rehabilitation. During rehabilitation, two separate processes followed. Four participants experienced their rehabilitation as being a mutually shared process {{that led to a}} process of change. They were actively engaged, using <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plan,</b> and working towards goals targeting a broad perspective of daily activities. The remaining two participants experienced their rehabilitation as a staff-directed process, with limited use of <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plan,</b> focusing on goals mainly related to body functions and self-care, not leading to any substantial changes. Conclusion: When clients experience that they develop a mutually shared rehabilitation process, based on a rehabilitation plan, they became more engaged in their rehabilitation and gained a better understanding of their participation during the process. Knowledge of the differences in how clients use <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plan</b> during the rehabilitation process can support their active engagement during rehabilitation.

Despite the increase in funds devoted to rehabilitation of these systems little success has been reported so far. When <b>planning</b> for <b>rehabilitation</b> of catchments, stakeholders have to decide what combination of actions to implement and at which locations from a vast number of possible options. Often these activities are constrained by limited budgets. Here we apply the principles of systematic <b>planning</b> to <b>rehabilitation,</b> integrating erosion, sediment transport, ecological and economic objectives into the planning process to enhance the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plans</b> and to support stakeholders in better understanding the effects of various objectives. We develop and apply a multi-objective approach to find a set of near-optimal trade-off solutions among a large number of candidate combinations of rehabilitation actions under sometimes competing objectives. We use a Pareto-optimal approach to store potentially useful combinations of rehabilitation actions (trade-offs) along the management objective gradients. Presenting those trade-offs as a function of the management objectives allow users to understand the commonalities and differences of various rehabilitation options when selecting different objectives. It is the learning from these relationships that classic optimisation approaches often lack. As proof of concept, we used an example rehabilitation project in South East Queensland (Australia) that aims to reduce sediment loads and improve the ecological health (measured as the EHMP index) of rivers while minimizing opportunity cost of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plans.</b> Opportunity cost is defined as the forgone economic value that would be compromised by the implementation of a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>plan.</b> We found that our approach was efficient and effective in finding and systematically presenting promising trade-offs along different objective gradients (sediment reduction, ecosystem health and opportunity cost economics).

The authors sought to assess contralateral neglect in subacute left hemisphere stroke patients using a comprehensive test battery validated in a large control group after right hemisphere stroke. Methods: Seventy-eight left hemisphere stroke patients were assessed. The test battery included a preliminary assessment of anosognosia and visual extinction, a clinical assessment of gaze orientation and personal neglect, and paper-and-pencil tests of spatial neglect in the peripersonal space. Only nonverbal tests were used. Results: Drawing and cancellation tasks revealed neglect in 10 to 13 % of patients. The combined battery was more sensitive than any single test alone. A total of 43. 5 % of patients showed some degree of neglect on at least one measure. Anatomic analyses showed that neglect was more common and severe when the posterior association cortex was damaged. Conclusions: The frequency of occurrence of right neglect was, as expected, much lower than that reported in a study using the same assessment battery in right brain damage stroke patients.
