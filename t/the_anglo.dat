5|$|Sir Frank Stockdale (1883–1949) was a Holmes Scholar, {{and during}} his career as an agriculturalist played a leading part in {{establishing}} rubber, tea, and coconut research institutions. He was appointed the first comptroller for development and welfare in the West Indies in 1940, and was co-chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> Caribbean Commission.

5|$|Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress {{passed a}} series of laws that seemed to {{discriminate}} against Anglo colonists {{in the province of}} Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de Santa Anna led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Mexican government passed {{new laws}} allowing land sale in Texas, and Bowie returned to land speculation. He was appointed a land commissioner and tasked with promoting {{settlement in the}} area purchased by John T. Mason. His appointment ended in May 1835 when President Antonio López de Santa Anna abolished the Coahuila y Tejas government and ordered the arrest of all Texans (including Bowie) doing business in Monclova. Bowie was forced to flee Monclova and return to <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> areas of Texas.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 77 - 85) The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate whether there were significant differences between Chicano and Anglo subjects' evaluations of spoken Spanish and English on the Personality Scale using the matched-guise method. A questionnaire packet was administered to a sample of one hundred, sixty-two freshmen and sophomore students at California State University, Northridge. The sample was divided into two groups of eighty-one Chicano students and eighty-one <b>Anglo</b> students. <b>The</b> data were analyzed by means, standard deviation, and Chisquare analyses to test the hypotheses. Results supported Hypothesis 1, Chicanos in general rated English speakers statistically significantly higher than Spanish speakers. Hypothesis 2 was not supported, instead of <b>the</b> <b>Anglos</b> rating certain personality characteristics more favorable for Spanish speakers, <b>the</b> <b>Anglos</b> in general rated English speakers statistically significantly higher. In cumulative comparison ratings, results did not support Hypothesis 3, Chicanos rated Spanish speakers statistically significantly higher instead of lower than <b>the</b> <b>Anglos.</b> In cumulative comparison ratings, results did not support Hypothesis 4, Chicanos rated only one personality characteristic statistically significantly higher in English than <b>the</b> <b>Anglos.</b> <b>The</b> conclusion of this study was that subjective evaluations of personality characteristics are systematically affected by associations made with community-wide stereotypes held about majority and minority groups whose languages were presented. Recommendations for future research were suggested...|$|R
5|$|Alexander's birthdate is unknown. Together {{with his}} cousin Nigel he was educated at Laon, under the {{schoolmaster}} Anselm of Laon, {{and returned to}} England at some unknown date. The historian Martin Brett feels that Alexander probably served as a royal chaplain early in his career, although no sources support this conjecture. Alexander was an archdeacon in the diocese of Salisbury by 1121, under his uncle. While occupying that office he was credited with a writing a glossary of Old English legal terms in <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> Norman language, entitled the Expositiones Vocabulorum. Unlike his cousin Nigel, Alexander {{does not appear to}} have entered the king's household or administration before his appointment as a bishop, and only attested, or witnessed, one royal charter before his elevation to the episcopate in 1123.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1966 Defence White Paper, the Air Ministry {{decided on}} two aircraft: the F-111K, with a longer-term {{replacement}} being a joint Anglo-French project for a variable geometry strike aircraft - <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> French Variable Geometry Aircraft (AFVG). A censure debate followed on 1 May 1967, in which Healey claimed {{the cost of}} the TSR-2 would have been £1,700 million over 15 years including running costs, compared with £1,000 million for the F-111K/AFVG combination. Although 10 F-111Ks were ordered in April 1966 with an additional order for 40 in April 1967, the F-111 programme suffered enormous cost escalation coupled with the devaluation of the pound, far exceeding that of the TSR-2 projection. Many technical problems were still unresolved before successful operational deployment and, faced with poorer-than-projected performance estimates, the order for 50 F-111Ks for the RAF was eventually cancelled in January 1968.|$|E
5|$|Santa Anna {{ordered that}} the Tejano {{civilian}} survivors {{be allowed to}} return to their homes in San Antonio. Dickinson and Joe were allowed to travel towards <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> settlements, escorted by Ben, a former slave from the United States who served as Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte's cook. Each woman was given $2 and a blanket and was allowed to go free and spread the news of the destruction that awaited those who opposed the Mexican government. Before releasing Joe, Santa Anna ordered that the surviving members of the Mexican Army parade in a grand review, in the hopes that Joe and Dickinson would deliver a warning to the remainder of the Texian forces that his army was unbeatable.|$|E
50|$|The Plains Indians raided each other, the Spanish colonies, and, increasingly, the {{encroaching}} {{frontier of}} <b>the</b> <b>Anglos</b> for horses, and other property.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of large deposits of copper sulfide during the 1900s encouraged large mining companies {{to invest in}} Northern Rhodesia. South Afric{{an interest in the}} region was led by <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> American Corporation, which gained an interest in the Bwana Mkubwa Company in 1924 and acquired a one-third interest in Mufulira in 1928. That year, Anglo American acquired control of the Nkana mine at Kitwe and formed Rhodesian Anglo American; shareholders included the United States, South African finance houses and the British South Africa Company. As the BSAC purchased shares in Rhodesian Anglo American, the latter became a major shareholder in BSAC. By 1930, Chester Beatty's Rhodesian Selection Trust and Ernest Oppenheimer's Anglo-American Corporation controlled most of the region's mining. The Roan Antelope and Nkana mines began commercial production in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Burnham-on-Sea {{is the history}} of the {{reclamation}} of the Somerset Levels from the River Severn and the Bristol Channel. The Romans were the first peoples to try to reclaim the Somerset levels, and it was their people who were probably the first settlers in the high sand dunes behind the River Parrett. This could have been in part to maintain navigational systems, to aid ships entering the River Parrett and what is now Highbridge. When the Romans left, the system of drainage they installed was not maintained, and the areas reverted to become a tidal salt flat during <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> Saxon period.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} over 1,000 years of {{religious}} and military history, including a monastery {{dating back to the}} 10th century and Taunton Castle, which has origins in <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> Saxon period and was later the site of a priory. The Normans then built a stone structured castle, which belonged to the Bishops of Winchester. The current heavily reconstructed buildings are the inner ward, which now houses the Museum of Somerset and the Somerset Military Museum. The town is undergoing a regeneration project with redevelopment of the town centre. It has various transport links which support its central role in economy and commerce. These have included the Grand Western Canal which reached Taunton in 1839 and arrival of the railway in 1842.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{residents}} resisted <b>the</b> new <b>Anglo</b> powers by resorting to banditry against the gringos. In 1856, Juan Flores threatened Southern California with a full-scale revolt. He was hanged in Los Angeles in front of 3,000 spectators. Tiburcio Vasquez, a legend {{in his own time}} among the Mexican-born population for his daring feats against <b>the</b> <b>Anglos,</b> was captured in present-day Santa Clarita, California on May 14, 1874. He was found guilty of two counts of murder by a San Jose jury in 1874, and was hanged there in 1875.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Anglos</b> and Hispanics cooperated {{because both}} prosperous and poor Hispanics could vote and they outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>Anglos.</b> Around 1920, <b>the</b> term [...] "Spanish-American" [...] {{replaced}} [...] "Mexican" [...] in polite society and in political debate. The new term served both {{the interests of}} both groups. For Spanish speakers, it evoked Spain, Not Mexico, recalling images of a romantic colonial past and suggesting a future of equality in Anglo-dominated America. For <b>Anglos,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a [...] "Mexican" [...] land suggested violence and disorder, and had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign. The new term gave the impression that [...] "Spanish Americans" [...] belonged to a true American political culture, making the established order appear all the more democratic.|$|R
5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
5|$|Under the Commonwealth of England, Robert Blake {{used the}} harbour as his base during the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 and <b>the</b> <b>Anglo</b> Spanish War of 1654. He died {{within sight of}} the town {{returning}} from Cádiz. After the end of the Civil War in 1646, Portsmouth was among the first towns to declare CharlesII as king and subsequently began to prosper. In 1650, the first ship to be built for more than 100 years, HMS Portsmouth, was launched. Between 1650 and 1660, twelve ships were built. After the restoration of Monarchy, CharlesII married Catherine of Braganza in the Royal Garrison Church. During {{the latter half of the}} 17th century the town continued to grow; a new wharf was constructed in 1663 for military use, and in 1665 a mast pond was dug out. In 1684 a list of ships docked in Portsmouth gave evidence of its increasing national importance; the town was the only place of naval rendezvous in England at the time. Between 1667 and 1685 the town's fortifications were rebuilt; new walls were constructed with bastions and two moats were dug, making Portsmouth one of the most heavily fortified places in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Within {{this first}} chapter, Anzaldua begins her book by arguing against <b>the</b> <b>Anglos</b> notion that <b>the</b> land {{belongs to the}} {{descendants}} of European families.

[...] Furthermore, she argues that <b>the</b> <b>Anglos</b> imposed themselves and took the land from indigenous people. Because of the fiction of [...] "White Superiority" [...] the only legitimate inhabitants are those in power, the whites and those who align themselves with whites. The invasion of land and privacy has displaced families and communities. the [...] "border" [...] didn't stop in the US and carried into Mexico where Indigenous communities were displaced by powerful landowners in partnership with US colonizing companies. Yet, despite all the barriers, Chicanos {{have been able to}} make a living and support their communities. Slowly, but progressively they continue to prosper.|$|R
