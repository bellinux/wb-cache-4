5|$|In France, the {{unilateral}} British {{decision to}} evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, {{and the perceived}} preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces {{at the expense of}} the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral François Darlan originally ordered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> would form the rearguard. In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of 2nd Light Mechanized Division and the 68th Infantry Division. Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.|$|E

Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less {{than a week}} later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic {{at the sight of the}} British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island.

5|$|The {{raising of}} the British flags on Alexander and Canada {{was a clear}} {{indicator}} to Nielly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> were aware of his identity, and he instead ordered his squadron to hoist the French tricolour, finally abandoning the ruse that his ships were British. During the preceding three hours, {{the division of the}} French squadron in pursuit of Alexander had steadily closed the gap between the ships, Alexander responding by firing stern-chasers at the pursuers. The French ships responded by firing their bow-chasers at the British vessel. At 09:00 Canada too came in range, Nielly ordering his flagship Marat to fire on the Hamilton's ship, the shot flying over the vessel and harmlessly into the sea. Hamilton responded with fire from his own stern-chasers and Bligh issued signals for Alexander and Canada to form a line, Canada in the lead, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> vessels might mutually support one another.|$|E

5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived at}} Fort Armstrong on Rock Island on April 12, he learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Band was in Illinois, {{and that most}} of the Meskwakis he wanted to arrest were now with the band. Like other American officials, Atkinson was {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Band intended to start a war. Because he had few troops at his disposal, Atkinson hoped to get support from the Illinois state militia. He wrote to Governor Reynolds on April 13, describing—and perhaps purposely exaggerating—the threat <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Band posed. Reynolds, who was eager for a war to drive the Indians out of the state, responded as Atkinson had hoped: he called for militia volunteers to assemble at Beardstown by April 22 to begin a thirty-day enlistment. The 2,100 men who volunteered were organized into a brigade of five regiments under Brigadier General Samuel Whiteside. Among the militiamen was 23-year-old Abraham Lincoln, who was elected captain of his company.|$|E
5|$|A copy of The Times {{informed}} von Reuter {{that the}} Armistice was to expire {{at noon on}} 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiser sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines.
