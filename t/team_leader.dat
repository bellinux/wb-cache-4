5000|$|In any {{functional}} team, cohesion amongst <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> {{and decision}} makers is vital. Cohesive leadership means that <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> are acting {{together as a}} unit and making decisions as a leadership team instead of each branching off into their own work and operating individually. This will ensure that the team will be steered in one direction instead of multiple due to <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> not being concise and consistent with their instructions. Cohesive leadership will require <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> to have strong communication skills.|$|R

40|$|Creativity is {{essential}} {{for research and development}} efforts. Unfortunately, little is known about how the role of <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> determines the <b>team's</b> creativity. Based on a sample of 39 engineering design teams in the space industry, this study examines the effects of leader position within different flows of communication on team creativity. The results indicate that the balance between holding a central or a peripheral position indeed determines the creativity of such teams. Specifically, very central and very peripheral positions of <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> within the work-flow and awareness network hamper team creativity, whereas peripheral situated <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> within the information network propel the creativity. In addition, <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> stimulate creativity when they stay central in the external information network. In managerial terms, the analyses implicate that stimulating engineering design team creativity requires <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> to smartly limit their involvement in communication and mainly act as gatekeepers to external sources of information.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} recent {{developments}} in vocational education and training for <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> in Australia's automotive industry. The widespread introduction of team working in Australia was accompanied {{by the introduction of}} new vocational qualifications and the paper examines the impact that this has had on the skill development of <b>team</b> <b>leaders.</b> <b>Team</b> development in the Australian automotive industry is found to be increasingly dependent upon the informal work of <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> as the automotive manufacturing companies wind back their commitment to broad-based skill development at work. There is an increased focus upon on-the-job skill development but much of this happens informally, with formal competency assessments taking place outside the <b>team.</b> <b>Team</b> <b>leaders</b> have an important role in team development but this role is not recognised in current competency-based training in Australia...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{have chosen}} to write an essay about {{competence}} because we {{think that it is}} an important and a current subject of interest, both to us as future <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> but also to all activities within the community. We have a background working with eldercare and we have noticed that there are continued changes going on. This made us want to study what <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> and their staff think about competence and the development of competence. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse how <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> work to develop competence with their personnel working in home care. We also want to analyse how the personnel experience their competence and their need for development of competence. We have chosen a qualitative method with half structure interviews. With this method have we looked at the personnel’s experiences from their perspective and we have looked at how they understand their competence and need for development of competence. We also looked at how the <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> experience their situation from their perspective. The result of our study is that the personnel’s experience that they get all the development of competence that they demand and need. They also feel that their competence is important. The study also shows that the <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> do a lot for the development of competence within their personnel.
