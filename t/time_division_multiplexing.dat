In this paper we present a technique for separating the clock synchronization pulse from an incoming optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> data packet, based on all-optical switching devices with optical feedback. A 1 X 2 OTDM router composed of three Symmetric Mach-Zehnders (SMZs) is proposed. Simulation results show that synchronization between clock and data packet is achievable and the packet payload can be successfully switched to the correct destination port. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{options for}} high capacity all optical networks. Specifically optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> (OTDM) networks based on electro-optic modulators are investigated experimentally, whilst comparisons with alternative approaches are carried out. It is intended that the thesis will {{form the basis}} of comparison between optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> networks and the more mature approach of wavelength <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> networks. Following an introduction to optical networking concepts, the required component technologies are discussed. In particular various optical pulse sources are described with the demanding restrictions of optical multiplexing in mind. This is followed by a discussion of the construction of multiplexers and demultiplexers, including favoured techniques for high speed clock recovery. Theoretical treatments of the performance of Mach Zehnder and electroabsorption modulators support the design criteria that are established for the construction of simple optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> systems. Having established appropriate end terminals for an optical network, the thesis examines transmission issues associated with high speed RZ data signals. Propagation of RZ signals over both installed (standard fibre) and newly commissioned fibre routes are considered in turn. In the case of standard fibre systems, the use of dispersion compensation is summarised, and the application of mid span spectral inversion experimentally investigated. For green field sites, soliton like propagation of high speed data signals is demonstrated. In this case the particular restrictions of high speed soliton systems are discussed and experimentally investigated, namely the increasing impact of timing jitter and the downward pressure on repeater spacings due to the constraint of the average soliton model. These issues are each addressed through investigations of active soliton control for OTDM systems and through investigations of novel fibre types respectively. Finally the particularly remarkable networking potential of optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> systems is established, and infinite node cascadability using soliton control is demonstrated. A final comparison of the various technologies for optical multiplexing is presented in the conclusions, where the relative merits of the technologies for optical networking emerges as the key differentiator between technologies...|$|R

5000|$|A {{prominent}} {{problem with}} multiaccess channels is how can to assign transmission {{times to the}} users so that their messages do not collide. A simple method is to give each user their own time slot in which to transmit, requiring [...] slots. (This is called <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing,</b> or TDM.)

50|$|Statistical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> multiple-access is {{typically}} {{also based on}} time-domain multiplexing, {{but not in a}} cyclically repetitive frame structure. Due to its random character it can be categorised as statistical multiplexing methods, making it possible to provide dynamic bandwidth allocation. This requires a media access control (MAC) protocol, i.e. a principle for the nodes to take turns on the channel and to avoid collisions. Common examples are CSMA/CD, used in Ethernet bus networks and hub networks, and CSMA/CA, used in wireless networks such as IEEE 802.11.|$|E

50|$|Statistical {{multiplexing}} {{is a type}} {{of communication}} link sharing, very similar to dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA). In statistical multiplexing, a communication channel is divided into an arbitrary number of variable bitrate digital channels or data streams. The link sharing is adapted to the instantaneous traffic demands of the data streams that are transferred over each channel. This is an alternative to creating a fixed sharing of a link, such as in general <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (TDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM). When performed correctly, statistical multiplexing can provide a link utilization improvement, called the statistical multiplexing gain.|$|E
