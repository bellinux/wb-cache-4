40|$|Abstract—Handling log {{messages}} securely, for example, on servers or embedded devices, {{has often}} relied on cryptographic messages authentication codes (MACs) to ensure log file integrity: Any modification or deletion of a log entry will invalidate the MAC, making the <b>tampering</b> <b>evident.</b> However, organizational se-curity requirements regarding log files have changed significantly over the decades. For example, European privacy and {{personal data protection}} laws mandate that certain information, such as IP (internet protocol) addresses, must only be stored for a certain retention period, typically seven days. Traditional log file security measures, however, {{do not support the}} delayed deletion of partial log message information for such compliance reasons. This article presents SLOPPI (secure logging with privacy protection and integrity), a three-tiered log management framework with focus on integrity management and compliance as well as optional support for encryption-based confidentiality of log messages.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 'new' bottle, Grolsch uses a distinctively shaped bottle for some of its products, known as de beugel or swingtop. Bottles of this type use a flip top cap, {{eliminating the need for}} an opener. The brown domestic bottle contains 450ml, which is over one-third more than the capacity of the average Dutch beer bottle, while the green export bottle is slightly larger, at 467 ml. In 2008, the brewery introduced a slimmer design that is a consistent 450ml for both the domestic market and export. The new bottles can be opened by hand, using a lever {{at the side of the}} bottleneck. The label is applied over the lever in order to make any <b>tampering</b> <b>evident.</b> The top used to be made of porcelain, but is now made of plastic. Bottles with porcelain tops are still in circulation in the Netherlands. They are popular with home brewers, as they are very robust and can easily be sealed by hand without the expense of new crown seals. In North America, however, traditional metal-capped Grolsch bottles are becoming increasingly prevalent.|$|R

50|$|Shrink bands serve two {{purposes}} in the marketplace. <b>Tamper</b> <b>evident</b> shrink bands indicate if a product has been altered during fabrication, distribution or sale. Tamper resistant shrink bands make products difficult to open. This feature limits access to unintended audiences. Medicines and some retail products use shrink bands for both reasons.|$|E
25|$|Improved cargo {{security}} {{is also an}} important benefit of containerization. The cargo is not visible to the casual viewer and thus is less likely to be stolen; the doors of the containers are usually sealed so that <b>tampering</b> is more <b>evident.</b> Some containers are fitted with electronic monitoring devices and can be remotely monitored for changes in air pressure, which happens when the doors are opened. This reduced the thefts that had long plagued the shipping industry. Recent developments have focused on the use of intelligent logistics optimization to further enhance security.|$|R

50|$|An eNotary is a Notary Public who notarizes {{documents}} electronically. One of {{the methods}} employed by eNotaries {{is the use of}} a digital signature and digital notary seal to notarize digital documents and validate with a digital certificate. Electronic notarization is a process whereby a notary affixes an electronic signature and notary seal using a secure Public key to an electronic document (such as a PDF or Word document). Once affixed to the electronic document, the document is rendered <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> such that unauthorized attempts to alter the document will be evident to relying parties. The e-notary will use cryptography and Public key infrastructure to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke the digital certificate. The Electronic Notary also must keep an electronic register of each act performed.|$|E

We propose a privacy-preserving protocol for general calculations on fine-grained meter readings, while keeping the use of <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> meters to a strict minimum. We allow users to perform and prove the correctness of computations based on readings on their own devices, without disclosing any fine grained consumption. Applying the protocols to time-of-use billing is particularly simple and efficient, but we also support {{a wider variety of}} tariff policies. Cryptographic proofs and multiple implementations are used to show the proposed protocols are secure and efficient. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{first step}} in the {{workflow}} of the knowledge reuse mechanism is the comparison of the new order against past cases in order to identify similar cases and reuse their data. This similarity measurement emphasises on the differences exhibited between the basic attributes that characterise old and new orders alike. CBR is functioning on the premise that a comparison between cases is feasible. To accomplish that, a set of attributes of the product that enters the system as a new order is selected, to characterise the case. For every new ETO product, the engineers together with the customer complete a web-based form with predefined fields that comprise the product’s specifications. The attributes used to characterise the ETO product cases include: type of product, geometry stacks, slides, type of hardening, core cap, stacks material, profile rings, data provided, polishing, side of injection, <b>tamper</b> <b>evident,</b> gating type, way of ejection, ejector rings type, no of cavities, and wall thickness, depth, width, diameter, and length.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper brings forth a {{distributed}} self adaptive {{intrusion detection}} system (IDS) based on programmable mobile agents which {{can act as a}} key line of defense against major security attacks. The proposed intrusion detection model is organized as {{a combination of the two}} trends in IDS; the rule based and the behavior based scheme. Also this model draws out the merits of both the host based and networks based IDSs and deploy them wisely considering the critical features of MANETs. In contrast to many proposed and implemented IDSs, this is an efficient framework conscious of the inherent constraints of MANETS and are self adaptive in nature. In addition to this, the use of light weight mobile agents provide a low overhead mechanism which in turn is well suited to MANET characteristics. Through this paper, an attempt to improvise the mobile agents is done by making it <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> which is very essential as the agents can be compromised and thereby turning all the efforts of the IDS futile...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the first step of the {{extrusion}} blow moulding process as part of a global optimisation process encompassing several steps: optimisation of the part thickness, optimisation of the parison thickness that will guarantee the specified thickness profile and optimisation of the extrusion conditions (namely, the sequence of the die mandrel movements) required to obtain the optimal parison thickness distribution. A high density polyethylene (HDPE) extrusion blow moulded <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> container was studied using a finite element based analysis (FEA) {{in order to determine the}} optimized thickness distribution required for the blown part, considering its mechanical specifications. Several tests corresponding to the requirements for UN homologation for dangerous substances transportation were performed using a commercial software. Non-linear models were used to better describe the mechanical part behaviour. The results obtained at this stage were used to redesign the blown part. In future work this optimised design will be used as an input for optimising the subsequent stages. One of the authors (R. P.

40|$|Usability is a {{key factor}} in {{ensuring}} safe and efficacious use of medicines. However, several studies showed that people experience a variety of problems using their medicines. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify design features of oral medicines that cause use problems among older patients in daily practice. A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews on the experiences of older people with the use of their medicines was performed (n= 59). Information on practical problems, strategies to overcome these problems and the medicines' design features that caused these problems were collected. The practical problems and management strategies were categorised into 'use difficulties' and 'use errors'. A total of 158 use problems were identified, of which 45 were categorized as use difficulties and 113 as use error. Design features that contributed the most to the occurrence of use difficulties were the dimensions and surface texture of the dosage form (29. 6 % and 18. 5 %, respectively). Design features that contributed the most to the occurrence of use errors were the push-through force of blisters (22. 1 %) and <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> packaging (12. 1 %). These findings will help developers of medicinal products to proactively address potential usability issues with their medicines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Forensic {{analysis}} of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail {{to form a}} hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly {{over the past two}} decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve {{on the state of the}} art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromised has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network. I...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{requirement}} (within the food packaging industry) for a greater analytical knowledge and more scientific understanding of the ROPP capping process and of the interaction of caps (closures) with the threaded part of the glass container (finish). Threads used within the industry have largely developed empirically from metal thread profiles. An improved understanding is needed so that problems associated with that process can be better understood and solved. Such problems can be manifest in damaged closures, ‘spinners’ and closures that are just too difficult to open. The term ‘spinners’ is used for closures that do not break the pilfer band (a <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> safety feature) when twisted. The same term {{is also used to}} describe closures that have been turned the wrong way (i. e. clockwise) on opening, stripping the thread whilst not breaking the pilfer band. To combat this problem it is desirable to produce a closure system that has a high torque when twisted in the wrong direction (known as the over torque) whilst maintaining good seal integrity and a low torque for correct opening procedure. A successful feasibility study was carried out to investigate the appropriateness of using finite element techniques to investigate closure systems and gain the required understanding to improve these systems. The follow on project utilised these finite element techniques and experimental testing using a single-head capping machine. The Project focuses on the industry standard glass thread finish called the GF 305 that utilises an extra deep, aluminium ROPP closure. The results of this work so far are presented here...|$|E
30|$|The {{advent of}} public key cryptography, where a node is {{authenticated}} through {{the possession of}} a public/private key pair certified by a trust anchor, has addressed the primary threat posed by an outsider without valid credentials. But a vehicular network safeguarded through a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is only as secure as the means implemented to protect its member nodes' private keys. An IEEE standard has been proposed for securing vehicular communications in the Dedicated Short Range Communications Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (DSRC/WAVE) [1]. This standard advocates the use of digital signatures to secure vehicle safety broadcast messages, with tamper proof devices storing secret keys and cryptographic algorithms in each vehicle. Yet a convincing body of existing literature questions the resistance of such devices to a motivated attacker, especially in technologies that are relatively inexpensive and readily available [2, 3]. In the absence of strict distribution regulations, for example, if tamper proof devices for vehicular nodes are available off the shelf from a neighborhood mechanic, a supply chain exists for experimentation with these devices {{for the express purpose}} of extracting private keys. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established a certification process to evaluate the physical resistance of cryptographic processors to tampering, according to four security levels [4]. However, tamper resistance comes at a price. High end cryptographic processors certified at the highest level of tamper resistance are very expensive, for example, an IBM 4764 coprocessor costs in excess of 8000 USD [5]. Conversely, lower end <b>tamper</b> <b>evident</b> cryptographic modules, such as smartcards, feature limited mechanisms to prevent cryptographic material disclosure or modification and only provide evidence of tampering after the fact [6]. The European consortium researching solutions in vehicular communications security, SeVeCom, has highlighted the existence of a gap in tamper resistant technology for use in vehicular networks [7]. While low end devices lack physical security measures and suffer from computational performance issues, the cost of high end modules is prohibitive. The gap between the two extremes implies that a custom hardware and software solution is required, otherwise low end devices may be adopted and prove to be a boon for malicious insiders.|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} in Sect.  3.2, {{the new order}} that triggers the scheduling mechanism is first compared against documented past cases for the reuse of knowledge related to processes and product structure. In the presented work, the past case is the complete dataset of a previously executed mould-making order, including the mould specifications/attributes, scheduling parameters used, the schedule followed (policy, sequencing, etc.), and the documented processing times and sequencing of tasks. In the case study, the new order is compared against all 30 documented past cases. Ten attributes are considered by CBR for the pairwise comparison of cases, namely the: number of cavities, type of hardening, side of injection, mould size, core cap, ejector rings, <b>tamper</b> <b>evident,</b> type of data, surface’s quality, and number of basic components, with the following weight factors: 0.15, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15. The weight factors were defined and fine-tuned together with the experts of the case study. The resulting values denote the potential of an attribute to reveal actual production-related similarities between any two cases. For instance, the number of basic components {{that need to be}} manufactured directly affects the required number of manufacturing processes, and therefore, the attribute “number of basic components” is attributed with a large weight value, since the more the number of required process, the longer the flowtime of production. Another fundamental parameter that is taken into consideration is the shape of the stacks. There are two options, namely moulds with cylindrical or rectangular stacks. Since the mould “ 13.23 ” has cylindrical stacks, the attribute “length” is not considered during similarity. After a similarity calculation, the results indicate a similarity index of 83  % between moulds “ 13.23 ” and “ 12.20 ”. The planner then adapts the process plan of the latter in order to prepare the dataset for scheduling the former. The next most similar mould is “ 11.38 ”, which is 75  % similar to “ 13.23 ”. As given in Table  2, mould “ 13.23 ” differs from “ 12.20 ” in the attributes: “type of hardening”, “number of basic components”, and “width”. The components that are needed for manufacturing the “ 13.23 ” mould are less than the components of “ 12.20 ”, so the planner should reuse the sequence of processes of “ 11.38 ” mould and observe that components, such as the bottom plates, are missing. Based on his expertise, the extra components are removed and the process sequence is successfully customised for the new mould.|$|E
