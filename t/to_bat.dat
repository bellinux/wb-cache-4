5|$|Australia {{came out}} <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> {{halfway through the}} middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes came out <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder Sam Loxton <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out <b>to</b> <b>bat,</b> shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, against Leicestershire, Bradman won the toss and elected <b>to</b> <b>bat,</b> {{promoting}} Keith Miller ahead of himself to No. 3. As Miller came out <b>to</b> <b>bat,</b> the large crowd mobbed the players' entrance {{only to see}} that Bradman was not batting in his customary position. Bradman came to the crease at 2/157, and after initially being troubled by the left-arm unorthodox spin of Australian expatriate Jack Walsh, added 159 with Miller before falling for 81. Australia compiled 448 and bowled out the home side for 130 and 147 to win by an innings, with Bradman taking one catch.|$|E

40|$|Transmission of {{zoonotic}} pathogens from <b>bats</b> <b>to</b> humans {{through direct}} and indirect contact with bats raises public apprehension about living close <b>to</b> <b>bats.</b> In the township of Ve Golokuati in Ghana, several “camps” of Epomophorus gambianus roost in fruit trees that provide ecosystems services for residents. This study explored human-bat interaction in the township and the potential risks of disease transmission from <b>bats</b> <b>to</b> humans. Data were derived through questionnaire administration and participatory appraisal approach involving focus group discussions, participatory landscape mapping, and transect walk. The study found that most human activities within the township, such as petty-trading, domestic chores, and children’s outdoor recreation, exposed people <b>to</b> <b>bats.</b> Though {{there have been no}} reported cases of disease spillover from <b>bats</b> <b>to</b> humans from the perspective of residents and from medical records, respondents whose activities brought them closer <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> within the township were found to be more likely to experience fevers than those who do not interact with bats frequently. The study recommends education of community members about the potential risks involved in human-bat interactions and makes suggestions for reducing the frequent interactions with and exposure <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> by humans...|$|R

5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out <b>to</b> <b>bat,</b> particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1991 season, Memorial Stadium, the Orioles' {{home since}} 1954, saw its last MLB game against the Tigers. Ripken was the last Oriole <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> at the stadium, hitting into a double play against Detroit's Frank Tanana on Oct 6, 1991.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{headed south}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes resumed his opening position, while Hassett {{returned}} to his customary position in the middle order. England won the toss and elected <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Ray Lindwall's 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Healy stumped leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj {{from the}} bowling of Sthalekar and was not {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> as Australia reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven balls to spare. Australia elected <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> first in the final against New Zealand, but was top-order struggled and Healy came to the crease to join Elliott at 5/51 in the 13th over {{after the fall of}} two wickets in quick succession. The pair lifted the run rate by adding 21 runs in 18 balls. Healy scored 10 from as many balls, but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan in the outfield. This left the score at 6/72 in the 16th over, and Australia eventually ended on 8/106.|$|E

50|$|There is {{now some}} dispute {{as to whether}} this smaller Ungulata is a {{cladistic}} (evolution-based) group, or merely a phenetic group (form taxon) or folk taxon (similar, but not necessarily related). Some studies have indeed found the mesaxonian ungulates and paraxonian ungulates to form a monophyletic lineage, closely related to either the Ferae (the carnivorans and the pangolins) in the clade Fereuungulata or <b>to</b> the <b>bats.</b> Other studies found the two orders not that closely related, as some place the perissodactyls as close relatives <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> and Ferae in Pegasoferae and others place the artiodactyls as close relatives <b>to</b> <b>bats.</b>|$|R
5|$|In April 2006, Karthik's {{career was}} revived {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to the ODI team by selectors to give Dhoni a rest in the final ODI against England in Indore. He was not required <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> as India cruised to a seven-wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Test at The Oval, Bradman walked out <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> in Australia's first innings. He {{received}} {{a standing ovation}} from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, {{it would have been}} 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes, a claim Bradman denied {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|It {{was thought}} that Bradman would play Ring, but {{he changed his mind}} on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket. Yardley won the toss and elected <b>to</b> <b>bat.</b> England lost leg spinner Wright before the match due to lumbago.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> {{with the help of a}} runner and passes his half-century, {{reducing}} the required runs to an attainable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> and swings extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.|$|E
5|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Loxton bowled only one over, which was a maiden, before pulling his groin while trying to attain more pace, as the hosts were bowled out for 71. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> or bowl again in the game as Australia replied with 101 and then removed the hosts for 89 to leave themselves a target of 60 for victory. Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31, effectively seven down with Loxton unable <b>to</b> <b>bat,</b> before scraping home without further loss, although both batsmen at the crease survived chances. Due to his injury, Loxton was rested {{for the next two}} matches against Surrey at The Oval in London and Cambridge University. Australia won both matches by an innings.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Lord’s Test. Australia elected to field and {{dismissed}} the hosts for 221. Brown injured a finger while fielding and was unable <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> in Australia's first innings. Hamence filled in as an opener alongside Hassett but was out for a duck, so Bradman joined his deputy with the score at 1/6. The Australian skipper put on 231 with Hassett, who top-scored with 139. Accelerating after reaching his century, Hassett was out for 4/289 and the tourists collapsed to be all out for 389, after losing 7/100. In the second innings, Australia's makeshift openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs required for a 10-wicket win in less than hour, so Hassett was not required <b>to</b> <b>bat.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Rabies is a fatal {{encephalitis}} {{caused by}} rabies virus, {{of the genus}} Lyssavirus. The principal reservoir for rabies in Latin America is the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), which feeds routinely on the blood of cattle, and when livestock are scarce, may prey on other mammals, including humans. Although rabies is endemic in common vampire bat populations in Guatemala, there is limited research {{on the extent of}} exposure <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> among human populations living near bat refuges. Results: A random sample of 270 of 473 households (57 %) in two communities located within 2 Km of a known bat roost was selected and one adult from each household was interviewed. Exposure <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> (bites, scratches or bare skin contact) was reported by 96 (6 %) of the 1, 721 residents among the selected households. Of those exposed, 40 % received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Four percent of household respondents reported that they would seek rabies post exposure prophylaxis if they were bitten by a bat. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that exposure <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> in communities near bat roosts is common but recognition of the potential for rabies transmission from bats is low. There is a need for educational outreach to raise awareness of bat-associated rabies, prevent exposures <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> and ensure appropriate health-seeking behaviours for bat-inflicted wounds, particularly among communities living near bat roosts in Guatemala...|$|R
5|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford on 8 July for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings; he {{was replaced by}} the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had made 47 not out against Surrey and an unbeaten 159 against Gloucestershire. Yardley won the toss and elected <b>to</b> <b>bat.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the final, he was again {{selected}} for the Academy squad for three limited overs matches against a touring Indian team. Queenslander Stuart Law captained the Australian side that included former Australian keeper Rod Marsh. In Australia's victory in the first match in Canberra, Ponting top-scored with 71, before making 52 in a victory in Sydney. The last match was also successful for the home team, with Ponting not required <b>to</b> <b>bat.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected <b>to</b> <b>bat</b> on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Ongoing {{potential}} exposure {{of members of}} the public <b>to</b> Australian <b>bat</b> lyssavirus (ABLV) in South East Queensland, Australia, prompted investigation of community knowledge, risk perception, and intention <b>to</b> handle <b>bats</b> <b>to</b> inform future prevention efforts. Methods: After pilot testing, a computer-assisted telephone survey of a representative sample of 700 adults without previous {{potential exposure}} to ABLV was undertaken in the defined geographic region. Results: Twenty-four percent of eligible contacted individuals participated. Basic knowledge of bats and ABLV was generally high, with 65 % of participants answering nine or more of 12 knowledge questions correctly. The perceived risk that <b>bats</b> pose <b>to</b> human health was also high, with 93 % indicating some degree of risk. Although 88 % of participants indicated they would handle bats in {{one or more of the}} scripted situations, overall intention <b>to</b> handle <b>bats</b> was low, with 59 % indicating they would handle a bat in four or less of the 12 scenarios. Younger males with lower risk perception of bats most frequently indicated intention <b>to</b> handle <b>bats</b> in varying situations. Knowledge score was not associated with intention <b>to</b> handle <b>bats</b> on multivariate modeling. Conclusions: Future public health prevention efforts, both in Australia and overseas, should focus further on conveying the risk to humans and <b>to</b> <b>bats</b> when nontrained, nonvaccinated people attempt <b>to</b> handle <b>bats</b> rather than attempting to purely convey knowledge about bats and ABLV or rabies. Suitable alternative measures to handling should be included. Younger adult males are a particular target group for prevention efforts. Griffith Health, School of MedicineFull Tex...|$|R
