Toronto City Council chose to initiate studies with the Port Authority on the proposal. In November 2015, the newly-elected Government of Canada notified Ports Toronto that it would not sign any agreement to allow jets. The City and Ports Toronto ended their studies of the proposal.|$|E

Wali Khan's negotiations with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto led to the signing of an agreement with the government in 1972, called the <b>Tripartite</b> <b>Agreement.</b> The agreement led to the lifting of martial law and removal of the ban on the National Awami Party. This {{led to the formation of}} National Awami Party coalition provincial governments in the NWFP and Baluchistan. Despite the initial positive start, the agreement rapidly began to unravel due to the growing animosity between Khan and Bhutto.|$|E

In December 2009, the TPA announced that it would allow between 42 and 92 daily landings and takeoffs at the airport, beyond the current 120 per day 'slots' allotted.

The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA officers at the airport can handle aircraft with up to 90 passengers. The airport does not have US Customs, although this has been approved by both Canada and US governments. The airport's hours of operation are 6:45am to 11:00pm, except for MEDEVAC flights. The airport's hours are governed by the 2003 update of the <b>Tripartite</b> <b>Agreement</b> which set the hours of operation.

In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a <b>tripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia.

In November 2002, City Council met to debate the competing proposals, that of closing the airport in favour of some parkland, or of approving the TPA's plans and having uncontested title to the port lands. Despite pleas from former mayor David Crombie, urban planner/activist Jane Jacobs and Harbourfront residents, the TPA plan was supported by then-mayor Mel Lastman, who argued that the estimated $190 million of annual economic benefit the airport would create, was too good to pass up. On November 28, 2002, Council in a day-long debate, made two votes to settle the issue. First, Council voted 32–9 to accept a settlement to end the TPA port-lands lawsuit in exchange for an immediate payment of $5.5 million and an annual subsidy of $5.5 million to the TPA until 2012. Council then voted 29–11 to approve the amendment of the <b>tripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> to permit a fixed link and the construction of a lift bridge.|$|E

25|$|Conceived in the 1930s as {{the main}} airport for Toronto, the {{construction}} of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC). At the same time, the THC built Malton Airport as an alternate, but nearby Malton (today Toronto Pearson International Airport) became Toronto's main passenger airline hub instead, leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed an expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs. Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport. After the expansion, civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s. Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s, the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed. In 1983, a 50-year <b>tripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> between the governments of Canada, City of Toronto and the Harbour Commission, which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines, allowed airport operations to continue. In the 1990s, in an era of government cost-cutting, questions about the airport's future were raised again due to its annual deficit. At the same time, redevelopment was taking over north of the airport and several studies suggested that the airport was incompatible with development.|$|E
