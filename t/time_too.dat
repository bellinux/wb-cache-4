In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably in this <b>time</b> <b>too</b> that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Such {{publications}} {{were followed}} by multilingual collections, of which the most ambitious was Alessandro Torri’s L'elegia di Tommaso Gray sopra un cimitero di campagna tradotta dall'inglese in più lingue con varie cose finora inedite (Verona 1819). This included four translations into Latin, of which one was Christopher Anstey’s and another was Costa’s; eight into Italian, where versions in prose and terza rima accompanied those already mentioned by Torelli and Cesarotti; two in French, two in German and one each in Greek and Hebrew. Even more translations were eventually added in the new edition of 1843. By that <b>time,</b> <b>too,</b> John Martin’s illustrated edition of 1839 had appeared with translations into Latin, Greek, German, Italian and French, of which only the Torelli version had appeared in previous collections. What we learn from all this activity is that, as the centenary of its first publication approached, interest in Gray’s Elegy continued unabated in Europe and new translations of it continued to be made.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, Mizoguchi's parents, {{too poor}} to {{continue}} paying for their son's primary school training, sent him to stay with an uncle in Morioka, in northern Japan, for a year - a period that saw the onset of crippling rheumatoid arthritis that was to afflict him during adolescence and leave him with a lop-sided walking gait {{for the rest of}} his life. The year 1912, back with his parents, was spent almost entirely in bed. In 1913 Mizoguchi's sister Suzu secured him work as an apprentice, designing patterns for kimonos and yukatas. In 1915 his mother died, and Suzu brought her younger brothers into her own house and looked after them. In 1916 he enrolled for a course at the Aoibashi Yoga Kenkyuko art school in Tokyo, which taught Western painting techniques. At this <b>time</b> <b>too</b> he pursued a new interest in opera, particularly at the Royal Theatre at Akasaka where he began, in due course, to help the set decorators.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{was intended for}} military brass band concerts. These were very popular from 1924 {{to the end of}} World War II, but were then discontinued, being by that <b>time</b> <b>too</b> expensive. in the 1920s and 1930s during good weather there were two daily band performances to full house. Tea dances, originally to the music of Wylie Price and his orchestra, were popular until the 1950s, although a tea dance celebrated the 1999 reopening, and a charity tea dance to the music of Colin Jay took place in September 2000 in aid of Shopmobility. The traditional position for the Punch and Judy entertainment in summer has always been on the beach at {{the west side of the}} Pier, but since the cessation of military band concerts the Bandstand has provided a venue for Colin Bennett's puppets on rainy days. By the 1960s, general audiences for musicians and entertainers were being lured away by cheap continental holidays, and by 1974 the building was being used for children's and seniors' entertainment, and it had a children's roller skating area.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{generally}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C+, finding that {{it to be}} ambitious but ultimately feeling that it attempted too much at once. VanDerWerff found the episode [...] "entertaining", but added that it [...] "feels like something that’s been rewritten at least one <b>time</b> <b>too</b> many, to incorporate more and more ideas until the center cannot hold". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, praising Williams' guest appearance. Gibron also felt positively about the episode's complexity, feeling that it displayed [...] "a certain intelligence" [...] in assuming such a pace. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Sense and Antisense" [...] two stars out of five, describing it as [...] "too thin and too obvious". Shearman praised Williams' guest appearance, but felt that the episode seemed too close thematically to The X-Files to work well on its own.|$|E

There is also an item described as [...] "Gray's Elegy set to music" [...] in various settings for voice accompanied by harpsichord or harp by Thomas Billington (1754-1832), although this too may have only been an excerpt.

The class was delivered in four versions, named A through D. After the initial delivery of fifteen 69As in 1970 and 1971, twenty 69Bs were delivered in 1974 and 1975. These were designed to operate on longer sections and were equipped with only one door per car. This turned out to extend stopping <b>time</b> <b>too</b> much, and the C and D versions were delivered with two doors per car. From 1975 to 1977, NSB took delivery of fourteen 69Cs and from 1983 to 1993 thirty-nine 69Ds. The latter is distinguishable because of its different front. NSB operates both two- and three-car sets, and up to three units can be run in multiple, allowing NSB to operate any train length from two to nine cars. Eighty-two units remain in service, although some of those are used on the Bergen Commuter Rail and the Arendal Line.|$|E
