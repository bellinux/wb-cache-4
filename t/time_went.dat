5|$|After {{the success}} of The Combat, Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E
5|$|As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by, Matilda {{directed}} more of {{her attention}} to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E

5|$|As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and}} more alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E
5|$|As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by, {{authorities}} received few tips regarding Power's {{location and}} she was eventually removed from the Most Wanted Fugitives list in 1984. The following year, she settled {{in the city of}} Lebanon in Oregon's Willamette Valley with her son Jamie and boyfriend Ron Duncan, a local meat cutter and bookkeeper. While living in Oregon, Power taught cooking classes at Linn-Benton Community College in Albany and worked at restaurants in Corvallis and Eugene. She reached the shortlist for the post of food writer for the Corvallis Gazette-Times and became part-owner of Napoli Restaurant and Bakery in Eugene.|$|E
5|$|As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France {{would never}} accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E

5|$|As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, the North Korean {{government}} {{became more}} aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich {{remained}} the favourite home of Richard Talbot's descendants for many years. During the early years, {{the security situation}} in Wales remained of concern. Owain Glyndŵr rebelled against English rule in 1402 and Welsh forces invaded the Goodrich area in 1404 and 1405. Gilbert Talbot was responsible for fighting back the Welsh advance and securing the castle. As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, however, the threat began to diminish. During the 15th century the Talbots considerably expanded {{the size of the}} lord's quarters in the castle and provided additional accommodation for servants and retainers.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{overlaps}} {{were eliminated}} as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on. In the early 1940s, NY32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY32B was truncated {{to end in}} Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY32A became a realignment of NY32, creating an uninterrupted overlap between US4 and NY32 from Waterford to Northumberland. In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US4. The overlap with NY40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY40 was truncated to begin at the junction of US4 and Winter Street.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Olaf and Thorgerd lived happily {{together}} at Hoskuldstead for some time. Around 962 Olaf's foster father Thord died, leaving Olaf his property and goðorð Olaf bought land {{and built a}} new homestead at Hjardarholt, which, according to the saga, he had to cleanse of the draugr of its former owner, Killer-Hrapp. As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on people began to settle near Olaf's hall and regarded him as their goði. Olaf's ever-increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld's wife Jorunn. Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter, Thurid. Hjardarholt was renowned for its rich decorations; some two decades later, the skald Úlfr Uggason composed the famous poem Húsdrápa, about certain mythological scenes illustrated {{on the walls of}} Olaf's hall.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{became popular}} in Germany during the 1930s, with over 70 percent of {{households}} owning a receiver by 1939, {{more than any other}} country. Radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable by July 1933. Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.|$|E

5|$|The fort was {{initially}} commanded by Captain James Crane, with a garrison of ten men, including his second in command, a porter, six gunners and two soldiers. As <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on, {{not all of}} the gunners worked full-time at the fort, some living and working in the town itself. It is uncertain how many artillery pieces the blockhouse {{was initially}} equipped with, although it is known that the five blockhouses along the Thames had 108 brass and iron guns in total between them in 1540.|$|E
5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as <b>time</b> <b>went</b> by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
