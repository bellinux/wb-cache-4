50|$|The land {{forfeited}} to the Conqueror was re-granted by {{him to be}} held by knight-service due to the king, not to the {{mesne lord}} as in European continental feudalism. In 1086 at the council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty to the crown. In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were either free or not free. The free inhabitants held their lands either by free tenure or by a tenure which was originally that of a non-free inhabitant, but attached to land {{in the possession of}} a free man. Free tenure was either military tenure, called also <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> chivalry, or <b>socage</b> (including burgage and petit serjeanty), or frankalmoin, by which ecclesiastical corporations generally held their land. The non-free inhabitants were called in the Domesday Book servi, cotarii, or bordarii, and later nativi or villani, the last name being applied to both free men and serfs. All these were in a more or less dependent condition. The free tenures all exist at the present day, though, as will appear later, the military tenures have shrunk into the unimportant and exceptional tenure of grand serjeanty. The non-free tenures are to a certain extent represented by copyhold.|$|R
5000|$|In England, patrilineal ultimogeniture (i.e., {{inheritance}} by {{the youngest}} surviving male child) {{is known as}} Borough English, after its former practice in various ancient English boroughs. It was only enforced against those who died intestate and frequently—though not universally—also included the principle of inheritance by the deceased's youngest brother {{when there was no}} son. Less often, the practice was extended to the youngest daughter, sister, aunt, etc. Its origin is much disputed, although the Normans—who generally practiced primogeniture—considered it to be a Saxon legacy. A 1327 court case found it to be the practice of the English burgh at Nottingham, although not of that town's [...] "French" [...] district. The tradition was also found across many rural areas of England where lands were held <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> by <b>socage.</b> It also occurred in copyhold manors in Hampshire, Surrey, Middlesex, Suffolk, and Sussex, where manorial custom dictated the form of inheritance to be ultimogeniture.|$|R

50|$|In archaic law, a computo was a writ, thus {{called from}} its effect, {{which was to}} compel a bailiff, chamberlain, or {{receiver}} to yield his accounts. The same was true for executors of executors; and against the guardian <b>in</b> <b>socage,</b> for waste made in the minority of the heir.|$|R
50|$|The {{other half}} would be split evenly among the {{surviving}} children. Children {{were entitled to}} a legitime, whether they were male or female, and could access their inheritances at 25, the legal age of majority. They could not be disinherited. Estates <b>in</b> free <b>socage</b> (seigneuries) were subject to different rules of inheritance, and estates <b>in</b> villein <b>socage</b> had to be partitioned equally. A free socage was inherited unequally with half going to the eldest son and the rest being divided equally among his siblings.|$|R
5000|$|Under the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, many baronies by tenure were {{converted}} into baronies by writ. The rest {{ceased to exist}} as feudal baronies by <b>tenure,</b> becoming baronies <b>in</b> free <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} under a [...] "free" [...] (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents. Thus baronies could no longer be held by military service. Parliamentary titles of honour had been limited since the 15th century by the Modus Tenenda Parliamenta act, and could thenceforth only be created by writ of summons or letters patent.|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{adoption}} of summons by writ, baronies thus no longer relate directly to land-holding, and thus no more feudal baronies needed thenceforth to be created. Following the Modus Tenendi Parliamenta of 1419, the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, the Feudal Tenure Act (1662), and the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1834, titles of feudal barony became obsolete and without legal force. The Abolition Act 1660 specifically states: baronies by tenure were converted into baronies by writ. The rest ceased to exist as feudal baronies by <b>tenure,</b> becoming baronies <b>in</b> free <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} under a [...] "free" [...] (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents.|$|R
50|$|Under feudal tenure, a fief {{could not}} be owned {{outright}} but was instead divided into competing interests known as estates in land; thus, a single tract of land could be held both <b>in</b> villein <b>socage</b> by a tenant and <b>in</b> free <b>socage</b> by {{the lord of the}} manor. Villein socage was subject to a number of real burdens and feudal incidents owed to the manorial landlord. For example, the Custom provided for the payment of an annual feu-duty (the cens) by villein socagers to the landlord as both revenue and as a token of submission. The entry fine (lods et ventes) was another mandatory payment, a conveyance fee for villein socages and amounting to a twelfth of the sales price, and derived from the feu-duty, as were other fees and the right of laudatio (retrait lignager).|$|R
