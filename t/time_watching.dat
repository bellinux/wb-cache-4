25|$|Nicholson {{was born}} in {{suburban}} East London and lived on Hackney Road as a child. He was orphaned at a young age, and moved to Islington to be raised by his two sisters, who ran a school there. They raised him {{as though he were}} a child of their own. The income from the school allowed them to live a comfortable lifestyle. He was taught by Henry Butter, a well-respected author who had written a much-read treatise on teaching spelling.

25|$|There {{appears to}} be no {{particular}} season for breeding. However, females with a large young in the pouch and a young on the back have been seen in March, July, August and September. Although the gestation period information is not available for the species, it is known that close relatives have gestation periods from 16 to 30 days. The new offspring spends its first five weeks in the female's large pouch which has two teats. The parents usually carry the new offspring on their back after they have left the mother's pouch. Caring for the young is divided nearly equally among the parents. The parents are assisted in raising the offspring by the previous offspring who commonly stay with the family unit. The parents practice protective behaviours such as spend <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> for predators, tail beating, and vocalizing and marshaling the young to keep them relatively close.|$|E
25|$|Miller and {{his band}} {{appeared}} in two Twentieth Century Fox films. In 1941's Sun Valley Serenade, they were major members of the cast, which also featured comedian Milton Berle, and Dorothy Dandridge with the Nicholas Brothers in the show-stopping song and dance number, Chattanooga Choo Choo. The Miller band returned to Hollywood to film 1942's Orchestra Wives, featuring Jackie Gleason playing a part as the group's bassist, Ben Beck. Miller had an ailment that made laughter extremely painful. Since Jackie Gleason was a comedian, Miller had a difficult <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> Gleason more than once, because Miller would start laughing. Harry Morgan appears as Cully Anderson, the unrequited love interest of Ann Rutherford's character, Connie Ward. Miller was contracted to do a third movie for Fox, Blind Date, but {{as he entered the}} U.S. Army, this never panned out. The Glenn Miller Story was released in 1953-1954 by Universal-International.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} Kufa {{was the center}} for the {{opposition}} to Umayyad rule, particularly Ali's supporters and Shias. In 741-42 Abu Muslim made his first contact with Abbasid agents there, and eventually he was introduced to the head of Abbasids, Imam Ibrahim, in Mecca. Around 746, Abu Muslim assumed leadership of the Hashimiyya in Khurasan. Unlike the Alid revolts which were open and straightforward about their demands, the Abbasids along with the Hashimite allies slowly built up an underground resistance movement to Umayyad rule. Secret networks were used to build a power base of support in the eastern Muslim lands to ensure the revolution's success. This buildup not only took place right {{on the heels of the}} Zaydi Revolt in Iraq, but also concurrently with the Berber Revolt in Iberia and Maghreb, the Ibadi rebellion in Yemen and Hijaz, and the Third Fitna in the Levant, with the revolt of al-Harith ibn Surayj in Khurasan and Central Asia occurring concurrently with the revolution itself. The Abbasids spent their preparation <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> as the Umayyad Empire was besieged from within itself in all four cardinal directions, and School of Oriental and African Studies Professor Emeritus G. R. Hawting has asserted that even if the Umayyad rulers had been aware of the Abbasids' preparations, it would not have been possible to mobilize against them.|$|E
500|$|Direct Lyrics' Kevin Apaza was {{positive}} towards the clip, stating that it [...] "isn't probably too high-budget, but it's {{good enough to}} put [...] {{in a good mood}} and have a good <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> it.

500|$|Earlier in the episode, Homer and June Bellamy {{attend an}} in-store {{appearance}} {{as part of}} the promotion for the new character Poochie. They are asked a question of internal consistency, like the show's fans do all the time; Homer says to the fan who asks the question, [...] "Why would a man whose shirt says 'Genius at Work' spend all his <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> a children's cartoon show?" [...] This is again a reflection on how the writers feel about the fans obsessing about internal consistency.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and just let the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and {{wrote that the}} episode, [...] "finds Duchovny {{back on his feet}} and ready for action, and he brings a new energy to the part." [...] He enjoyed the way the show {{presented}} the story as one wherein, [...] "we spend as much <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> Mulder from the outside as we do seeing events from his perspective," [...] because it [...] "makes things interesting." [...] Handlen also wrote that while the episode did not hit the emotional notes that its predecessor, [...] "Deadalive", did, it was nonetheless [...] "stronger plotwise" [...] and built to an [...] "inevitable conclusion in classic X-Files style".|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was an}} avid {{reader who}} {{fell in love with}} {{scientific}} and mathematical theories, he did not do well in science classes in college and avoided taking math. His grades during his first two years put him in the lower one-fifth of the class. During his sophomore year, he reportedly spent much of his <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> television, shooting pool, and occasionally smoking marijuana. In his junior and senior years, he became more involved with his studies, earning As and Bs. In his senior year, he took a class with oceanographer and global warming theorist Roger Revelle, who sparked Gore's interest in global warming and other environmental issues. Gore earned an A on his thesis, [...] "The Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency, 1947–1969", and graduated with an A.B. cum laude in June 1969.|$|E

500|$|The Jonas Brothers {{characters}} were voiced by Parker and Stone, with Parker providing the voices for Kevin and Nick, and Stone voicing Joe, {{although the two}} switched characters on some lines. Parker also provides the voice of Mickey Mouse in [...] "The Ring". Parker and Stone were inspired to make the episode by the Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience film, which was released the previous month. Because they were unfamiliar with the band, they spent {{a large amount of}} <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> Jonas Brothers concert clips online, which they found unoriginal and not very enjoyable. Parker said one of the Comedy Central employees told them that after she took her young daughter to see the concert film, the girl said, [...] "Mommy, my giney tickles". Parker thought the story was hilarious and worked the exact line into the episode.|$|E
500|$|On March 21, 2003, Yankovic {{began working}} on the album's parody songs, {{as well as the}} record's polka medley. The album opens with the parody [...] "Couch Potato", a play on Eminem's [...] "Lose Yourself", the {{critically}} acclaimed single from the film 8 Mile (2002). In Yankovic's version, the singer describes his obsession with watching television; the song references many TV shows, as well as cable and network channels. Prior to recording [...] "Couch Potato", Yankovic researched television so that his resulting parody would be accurate. He noted, “If I'm writing a song about TV, I'll spend a lot of <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> TV. I'll study TV Guide, I'll look at articles about television, and I'll try to make sure I'm giving every show its fair do [...] I can also spend all day watching TV and convince myself that I'm working, because I'm doing research." ...|$|E
500|$|Nimoy said Meyer {{gave the}} script [...] "the kind {{of humor and}} social comment, gadfly {{attitude}} I very much wanted". He added that his vision was for [...] "no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to really have a great <b>time</b> <b>watching</b> this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed {{a couple of big}} ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E
