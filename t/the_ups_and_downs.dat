5|$|Despite Husayn's {{rebellion}} and execution, the Hamdanid family continued to prosper: his brothers were soon released from captivity, and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu'nis al-Khadim and sharing in <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> {{of the court}} politics in Baghdad. It was Abdallah's two sons, however, al-Hasan and Ali, better known by their honorific titles Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, who established the family as the ruling dynasty in the semi-independent emirates of Mosul (until 978) and Aleppo (until 1002) respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{allure of}} class respectability is another {{constant}} in Les Chouans, {{as it is}} for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an illegitimate child contributes to her position {{at the start of the}} novel. <b>The</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E

Most of the subsequent sonnets describe <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of the relationship, culminating with an affair between the poet and the Dark Lady. The relationship seems to end when the Fair Youth succumbs to the Lady's charms (Sonnet 144).|$|E

That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

[...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship.

500|$|DeLoatch {{described}} the sitcom as [...] "focus on one relationship and follow all of <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> in it" [...] and its purpose as [...] "showing {{the male and}} female points of view". Shelly and J.T. often turn to their two close friends for advice about the opposite gender, love, and relationships. Shelly frequently looks for advice from former model Rita Lefleur (Ali Landry) and married friend Janie Egins (Natalie Desselle-Reid), while J.T. finds support in his best friend Donovan Brink (Sean Maguire) and nightclub manager Nick Dalaney (Brian Hooks). Even though Shelly and J.T.'s relationship is the recurrent storyline, the series does explore the relationships of its supporting cast; Donovan and Rita date each other, and the extremely picky Nick attempts to find the perfect partner.|$|E
30|$|The results {{obtained}} with <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> chirps (see Fig. 12) show some high side lobes around the coordinates (x,y)=(0, 5) in meter and (0,− 5). The maximum {{value of these}} side lobes is 27 dB lower than the main lobe. These two high side lobes have the same origin as the ghost in the range ambiguity configuration {{which is due to}} non orthogonality of <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> chirps. As expected, the ghost effect is reduced with the MIMO OFDM signals, as shown in Fig. 13, with a gain higher than 5 dB.|$|R

Instead of the usual practice of locating all signals {{on the same side}} of their respective tracks (GWR practice was to commonly put them to the right of the track, the same side their drivers stood on the locomotive), the Relief Line signals were on the left, and the Main Line signals were on the right.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{analytical}} {{model for a}} Wi-Fi network acting as a last-mile Internet access with multiple long-lived TCP connections on both <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> links. Our model considers the joint impact of buffer losses at the access point, contention at the medium access control layer, and packet losses due to the wireless channel being erroneous. We show that the model accurately quantifies the probability of an arbitrary TCP packet being discarded, and the total throughput obtained on <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> links. Furthermore, quantitative insights can be gained into the throughput that long-lived TCP flows achieve under the joint impact of all aforementioned types of losses. In particular, {{we find that the}} wireless channel errors and buffer overflows both lead to throughput unfairness, but that they do so in the opposite direction on <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> links, respectively. We demonstrate that this insight can be exploited so as to significantly mitigate the throughput unfairness without compromising the total obtainable network throughput...|$|R
500|$|Two mines, the Katy and the Hope, owned {{serially}} {{by several}} different companies between the mid-1890s and the mid-1920s, contributed to Basin's prosperity. In 1894, the Basin and Bay State Mining Company, organized by two brothers named Glass, began expanded operations at these mines. However, flooding and fires caused both mines to close by 1896; the Glass brothers {{lost control of}} the property, and the mines went idle. Despite <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of the local mines and despite several disastrous fires in town, Basin prospered. In 1905, the Basin Reduction Company led by F. Augustus Heinze, who owned mines in Butte, took over the properties left by the Glass brothers and improved them. By then, Basin had a population of 1,500, four rooming houses, a drug store, three hotels, a bath house, three grocery stores, a [...] bank, a newspaper, and 12 saloons.|$|E
500|$|... "Elevators (Me & You)" [...] {{illustrates}} OutKast's rise to fame, and {{was inspired}} by a show the band played at Howard University with P. Diddy in the audience. The song also discusses the unlikely partnership of André 3000 and Big Boi, and uses the metaphor of an elevator for <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of fame. [...] The final verse illustrates André 3000 dealing with a fan who pretends to have been childhood friends with him. [...] It also references Southern culture, including mentions of Cadillacs and extended family gatherings. [...] "Babylon" [...] reflects on religious attitudes towards sex and illustrates André 3000's upbringing and his forbidden attractions throughout childhood. [...] "Jazzy Belle" [...] discusses the group's [...] "increasingly enlightened" [...] view regarding women: [...] "Went from yellin'... bitches and hoes to queen thangs". [...] The album's closer [...] "13th Floor/Growing Old" [...] is a meditation on aging and emphasizes Southern hip hop's legitimacy.|$|E
