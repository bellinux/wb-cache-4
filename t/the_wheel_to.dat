5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>to</b> the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Wheel {{has also}} been {{licensed}} to International Game Technology for use in its slot machines. The games are all loosely based on the show, with contestants {{given the chance to}} spin <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> win a jackpot prize. Since 1996, over 200 slot games based on the show have been created, both for real-world casinos and those on the Internet. With over 1,000 wins awarded in excess of $1,000,000 and over $3 billion in jackpots delivered, Wheel has been regarded as the most successful slots brand of all time.|$|E

50|$|The {{steering}} ratio is {{the ratio of}} the number of degrees of turn of <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of degrees <b>the</b> <b>wheel(s)</b> turn as a result. In motorcycles, delta tricycles and bicycles, the {{steering ratio}} is always 1:1, because <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> is fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front <b>wheel.</b> A steering ratio of x:y means that a turn of <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> x degree(s) causes <b>the</b> <b>wheel(s)</b> <b>to</b> turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel,</b> 360 degrees, causes <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1.|$|R

5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> one side. The restoring {{force is applied}} in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{form of the}} potter's wheel {{was developed}} in the Near East around 3500 BC. This was then adopted by the people of Mesopotamia who later altered the performance of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> make it faster. Around 2000 years later, during the Late Helladic period, Mycenaeans adopted the wheel.|$|E
25|$|Another {{innovation}} of Murdoch's was his 1799 {{invention of}} a much simplified and more efficient steam wheel than those in use at the time. A precursor of the steam turbine, the steam wheel allowed <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> be directly turned by {{the pressure of the}} steam moving through it. By this time Murdoch's contract had been amended {{and he was able to}} patent this device in his own name.|$|E
50|$|On locomotives, these trucks {{may have}} two, three or {{possibly}} four axles, making the truck quite long. Such a long truck, particularly the {{three and four}} axle variants, {{makes it difficult for}} <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> go around curves. To solve this problem, Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) designed the Radial Steering Truck. This design allows <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> pivot around <b>the</b> center of the curve somewhat, allowing less wear on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> flanges and rails.|$|R

25|$|Very loose {{surfaces}} (such as {{gravel and}} loose dirt): In some loose-surface situations, {{it may be}} beneficial to completely lock up the rear wheel in order to slow down or maintain control. On very steep slopes with loose surfaces where any braking will cause <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> skid, it can be better to maintain control of the bicycle by the rear-brake more than one would normally. However neither wheel should stop rotating completely, as this will result in very little control.|$|E
25|$|Each {{time the}} {{pendulum}} swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the escape wheel (g). The {{force of the}} clock's mainspring or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's gear train, causes <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> turn, and a tooth presses {{against one of the}} pallets (h), giving the pendulum a short push. The clock's wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing the clock's hands at a steady rate.|$|E
25|$|The Exposition {{ended in}} October 1893, and the wheel closed in April 1894 and was {{dismantled}} and stored {{until the following}} year. It was then rebuilt on Chicago's North Side, near Lincoln Park, next to an exclusive neighborhood. This prompted William D. Boyce, then a local resident, to file a Circuit Court action against the owners of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> have it removed, but without success. It operated there from October 1895 until 1903, when it was again dismantled, then transported by rail to St. Louis for the 1904 World's Fair and finally destroyed by controlled demolition using dynamite on May 11, 1906.|$|E
50|$|The loss of {{friction}} between wheels and rail results in loss of tractive force — <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> begin <b>to</b> spin, {{and in some}} instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss {{of friction}} results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with <b>Wheel</b> slide protection <b>to</b> counter slippery rail conditions. Locked wheels can self-grind flat spots on the steel tyres, especially if <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> are still sliding when arriving at a non-greasy section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. This causes <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense.|$|R

50|$|Rail {{vehicle wheels}} are usually {{mounted on a}} solid axle, so they turn at the same speed. When a vehicle turns <b>the</b> outer <b>wheel</b> has <b>to</b> travel further than <b>the</b> inner <b>wheel.</b> On a road vehicle, this is usually {{achieved}} by allowing <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> move independently, and fixing <b>the</b> front <b>wheels</b> in an arrangement known as Ackermann steering geometry.|$|R
25|$|Clay is dug {{from the}} ground, checked for {{impurities}} {{and placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> be molded. Once the potter gets the shape he desires, the potter stops the wheel, allowing the access water to run of. The artist then spins it again to ensure the water is off then it is placed in a kiln. The kiln was usually a pit dug {{in the ground and}} heated by fire; these were estimated to reach a temperature of 950 degree Celsius (1,742 degree Fahrenheit). Later kilns were built above ground to be easier to maintain and ventilate. During the firing of the pottery, artists went through a three-phase firing in order to achieve the right colour (further reading).|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{therapists}} {{work with}} older adults to maintain independence, participate in meaningful activities, and live fulfilling lives. Some examples of areas that occupational therapists address with older adults are driving, aging in place, low vision, and dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered {{to determine if}} drivers are safe behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>To</b> enable independence of older adults at home, occupational therapists perform falls risk assessments, assess clients functioning in their homes, and recommend specific home modifications. When addressing low vision, occupational therapists modify tasks and the environment. While working with individuals with AD, occupational therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensuring safety, and promoting independence.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E

25|$|Reading {{the control}} yoke {{data from the}} FDR {{revealed}} that the pilots made a crucial error by pulling back on the control yoke throughout the dive with the stick-shaker audible on the CVR from {{the onset of the}} dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder, and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, pulling back on the yoke only aggravated the bank angle further. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the fatal dive in both a simulator, as well as a test 737-300 by flying the same parameters on the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190 knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> the opposite direction of the roll, and not pulling back on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot on the proper recovery technique for the situation experienced by the pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll to troubleshoot before recovery of the aircraft was impossible. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, it along with the crew and passengers were subjected up to a 4g load throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80 degree nose-down attitude traveling at approximately 300mph under significant sideslip.|$|E
500|$|At first, {{she decided}} to go with what was inside the white wheel. [...] However, after being prodded by the hosts to take the money instead, Weng decided to forgo the {{possible}} jackpot prize revealed in the white wheel and instead take home the ₱100,000 for this round, plus the ₱37,000 from the earlier round. After this, Willie pulled the dark film from the window embedded in <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> reveal what prize the contestant had lost by choosing to take home the ₱137,000. Pulling the dark film revealed the numeral zero. [...] This meant that if she had chosen the white wheel instead, she would have gone home with only ₱37,000.|$|E
500|$|The {{final round}} is always played {{at least in}} part in a [...] "speed-up" [...] format, in which the host spins <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the value of each consonant, with $1,000 being added to the value on which the wheel stops before the red contestant's arrow. Vowels do not add or deduct money from the contestants' scores in the speed-up round. The contestant in control calls one letter, and if it appears in the puzzle, the contestant is given three seconds to attempt to solve. Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the contestant who was in control {{at the time of the}} final spin, until the puzzle is solved. The three-second timer does not begin until the hostess has revealed all instances of a called letter and moved aside from the puzzle board, and the contestant may offer multiple guesses on his/her turn. After the speed-up round, the total winnings of the three contestants are compared. The contestant with the highest total winnings wins the game and advances to the bonus round. Contestants who fail to earn any cash or prizes in the game are awarded a consolation prize of $1,000 (or $2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams).|$|E

500|$|For {{spacecraft}} interior shots, ostensibly {{containing a}} giant centrifuge that produces artificial gravity, Kubrick had a [...] rotating [...] "ferris wheel" [...] built by Vickers-Armstrong Engineering Group {{at a cost}} of $750,000. The set was [...] in diameter and [...] wide. Various scenes in the Discovery centrifuge were shot by securing set pieces within the wheel, then rotating it while the actor walked or ran in sync with its motion, keeping him {{at the bottom of the}} wheel as it turned. The camera could be fixed to the inside of the rotating wheel to show the actor walking completely [...] "around" [...] the set, or mounted in such a way that the wheel rotated independently of the stationary camera, as in the jogging scene where the camera appears to alternately precede and follow the running actor. The shots where the actors appear on opposite sides of the wheel required one of the actors to be strapped securely into place at the [...] "top" [...] of the wheel as it moved to allow the other actor to walk to the [...] "bottom" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> join him. The most notable case is when Bowman enters the centrifuge from the central hub on a ladder, and joins Poole, who is eating on the other side of the centrifuge. This required Gary Lockwood to be strapped into a seat while Keir Dullea walked toward him from the opposite side of the wheel as it turned with him.|$|E
500|$|Anson {{was sent}} back to Britain shortly afterwards, and Lydiard rejoined his ship at Plymouth. After a period {{refitting}} Anson was assigned to the Channel Fleet and ordered to support the blockade of Brest by patrolling off Black Rocks. She sailed from Falmouth on 24 December, and reached Ile de Bas on 28 December. With a gale blowing up from the south west, Lydiard decided to return to port. He made for the Lizard, but in the poor weather, came up on the wrong side and became trapped on a lee shore, with breakers ahead. Anson rolled heavily in [...] rough seas, having retained the spars from her days as a 64-gun ship after she had been razeed. Lydiard's only option was to anchor, but early on the morning of 29 December the rising storm caused the anchor cables to part and she was driven onto the shore. Lydiard ordered the ship to be run onto a beach in the hope of saving as many lives as possible, and resolved to remain aboard to oversee the evacuation. The pounding surf prevented boats from being launched from the ship or the shore, and a number of the crew were swept away. Some managed to clamber along the fallen main-mast to the shore, while Lydiard clung to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> encourage them on. Eyewitnesses recorded that Lydiard had exhausted himself with the effort of organising the evacuation and clinging to the wreck in the violence of the storm. He attempted to leave the ship, but became distracted by trying to help a boy. In doing so Lydiard was washed away and drowned. The Naval Chronicles account of the wreck recorded that ...|$|E
500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E
