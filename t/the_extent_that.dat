5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.

The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E
