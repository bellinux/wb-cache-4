25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (<b>tamping)</b> and lining {{to restore the}} desired track geometry and smoothness of vehicle running. Weakness of the subgrade and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track. In its simplest form this consists of a continuous slab of concrete (like a highway structure) with the rails supported directly on its upper surface (using a resilient pad).|$|E

40|$|Cell-mediated {{immunity}} is {{an important}} host resistance mechanism against Cryptococcus neoformans, the etiological agent of cryptococcosis. Previous studies from our laboratory {{have shown that the}} anticryptococcal cell-mediated immune response as measured by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) is down-regulated by a cascade of antigen-specific T suppressor (Ts) cells. Recently, we have identified a population of CD 4 T cells that up-regulate the anticryptococcal DTH response (<b>Tamp</b> cells). The <b>Tamp</b> cells are found in the spleens of donor mice at 6 days after immunization with cryptococcal antigen, and they amplify the anticryptococcal DTH response when transferred to syngeneic recipients at the time of immunization of the recipients. In this study, we determined the effects of C. neoformans-specific Ts cells on the induction of the <b>Tamp</b> cells in the <b>Tamp</b> cell-donor mice and on the induction and expression of the amplified anticryptococcal DTH response in the <b>Tamp</b> cell-recipient mice. When cryptococcal-specific Ts 1 cells were given at the time of immunization of the <b>Tamp</b> cell-donor mice, induction of <b>Tamp</b> cells was inhibited. In contrast, when Ts 1 cells were given at the time of adoptive transfer of <b>Tamp</b> cells, the recipients displayed amplified DTH responses, indicating that Ts 1 cells do not affect the <b>Tamp</b> cells' function once the <b>Tamp</b> cells have been produced. C. neoformans-specific Ts 2 cells given at the time of either immunization or footpad challenge of the <b>Tamp</b> cell-recipient mice did not alter, to any measurable extent, the amplified DTH response. These results indicate that in addition to amplifying the anticryptococcal DTH response, <b>Tamp</b> cells may protect the anticryptococcal TDH cells from suppression by C. neoformans-specific Ts cells, much like contrasuppressor cells do in other systems. However, further characterization of the <b>Tamp</b> cells revealed that they are not adherent to Viscia villosa lectin, indicating that the anticryptococcal <b>Tamp</b> cells do not have this characteristic in common with contrasuppressor cells of other antigen systems...|$|R
25|$|Regular {{inspection}} of the ballast shoulder is important; as noted earlier, the lateral stability of the track depends upon the shoulder. The shoulder acquires some amount of stability over time, being compacted by traffic; maintenance tasks such as replacing ties, <b>tamping,</b> and ballast cleaning can upset this stability. After performing these tasks, {{it is necessary for}} either trains to run at reduced speed on the repaired routes, or to employ machinery to compact the shoulder again.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss the {{properties}} of tense as a grammatical feature, understood {{as a set of}} values and the methods of their realization on linguistic elements. I outline the criteria for recognizing various featural dependencies: agreement, government, and different types of multirepresentation of a feature value in a domain. I examine more closely three instances of tense-aspect-mood-polarity (<b>TAMP)</b> marking which have been put forward as candidates for agreement in tense: multirepresentation of <b>TAMP</b> in a verbal group/complex; multirepresentation of <b>TAMP</b> among elements bearing verbalizing case in Kayardild; and the modal cases of Kayardild which participate in <b>TAMP</b> marking. I argue that none of these arise as a result of syntactic agreement or government, but are due to the choice of a particular (semantic) value of <b>TAMP</b> for the clause. Hence, all these known instances of tense are morphosemantic, rather than morphosyntactic: syntax is not sensitive to the tense value of the verb. 1...|$|R

30|$|We {{sought to}} test the safety and {{efficacy}} of an inflatable bone <b>tamp</b> in performing intra-articular fracture reductions.
