25|$|The FDA has {{received}} criticism for its approval of certain coal tar derived food dyes such as FDC yellow 5 and 6, which are banned in most European countries. On September 6, 2007, the British Food Standards Agency revised advice on certain artificial food additives, including <b>tartrazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{distributed}} naturally occurring food chemical capable of provoking reactions is salicylate, although <b>tartrazine</b> and benzoic acid are well recognised in susceptible individuals. Benzoates and salicylates occur naturally in many foods, including fruits, juices, vegetables, spices, herbs, nuts, tea, wines, and coffee. Salicylate sensitivity causes reactions {{to not only}} aspirin and NSAIDs but also foods in which salicylates naturally occur, such as cherries.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{attempts}} at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration, {{particularly among the}} cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the Safranschou code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beetroot, pomegranate fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income. Safflower is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron. The spice is reportedly counterfeited with horse hair, corn silk, or shredded paper. <b>Tartrazine</b> or sunset yellow {{have been used to}} colour counterfeit powdered saffron.|$|E
2500|$|Hypozincemia {{is usually}} a {{nutritional}} deficiency, but can also be associated with malabsorption, diarrhea, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle-cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, pyroluria, and other chronic illnesses. It can also occur after bariatric surgery, heavy metal exposure and <b>tartrazine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Contact sensitivity, atopic dermatitis, eczema, and {{urticaria}} {{appear to}} be related phenomena the cause of which is generally {{believed to be the}} hydrophobic prolamin components of certain Triticeae, Aveneae cultivars, in wheat one of these proteins is ω-gliadin (Gli-B1 gene product). A study of mothers and infants on an allergen-free diet demonstrated that these conditions can be avoided if wheat sensitive cohort in the population avoid wheat {{in the first year of}} life. As with exercise induced anaphylaxis aspirin (also: <b>tartrazine,</b> sodium benzoate, sodium glutamate (MSG), [...] sodium metabisulfite, tyramine) may be sensitizing factors for reactivity. Studies of the wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis demonstrate that atopy and EIA can be triggered from the ingestion of that aspirin and probably NSAIDs allow the entry of wheat proteins into the blood, where IgE reacts within allergens in the dermal tissues. Some individuals may be so sensitive that low dose aspirin therapy can increase risk for both atopy and WDEIA.|$|E
50|$|Total {{avoidance}} is {{the most}} common way to deal with <b>tartrazine</b> sensitivity, but {{progress has been made in}} reducing people’s <b>tartrazine</b> sensitivity in a study of people who are simultaneously sensitive to both aspirin and <b>tartrazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tartrazine</b> {{appears to}} cause the most {{allergic}} and intolerance reactions of all the azo dyes, particularly among asthmatics and those with an aspirin intolerance. Symptoms from <b>tartrazine</b> sensitivity can occur by either ingestion or cutaneous exposure to a substance containing <b>tartrazine.</b> Symptoms appear after periods of time ranging from minutes to 6 to 14 hours.|$|E
50|$|Most, if not all, {{medication}} {{data sheets}} {{are required to}} contain {{a list of all}} ingredients, including <b>tartrazine.</b> Some include <b>tartrazine</b> in the allergens alert section.|$|E
5000|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} medical literature concluded that among patients with asthma, {{research has shown that}} exposure to <b>tartrazine</b> does not worsen symptoms and avoidance of <b>tartrazine</b> does not improve symptoms; however, [...] "due to the paucity of evidence, {{it is not possible to}} provide firm conclusions as to the effects of <b>tartrazine</b> on asthma control".|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS), a {{prescribing}} {{reference book}} for health professionals, mentions <b>tartrazine</b> {{as a potential}} allergy for each drug that contains <b>tartrazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>tartrazine</b> intolerance {{is estimated at}} roughly 360,000 Americans affected, less than 0.12% of the general population. According to the FDA, <b>tartrazine</b> causes hives in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people, or 0.01%.|$|E

50|$|Rumors began {{circulating}} about <b>tartrazine</b> in the 1990s {{regarding a}} link to its consumption (specifically its use in Mountain Dew) and adverse effects on male potency, testicle and penis size, and sperm count. There are no documented cases supporting the claim <b>tartrazine</b> will shrink a man's penis or cause it to stop growing.|$|E
50|$|An urban legend about Mountain Dew {{ingredients}} is that dye Yellow #5 (<b>tartrazine)</b> lowers sperm count. <b>Tartrazine</b> {{has never}} been scientifically linked {{to any of the}} alleged effects in the legends; nor has any other component of the drink. While some studies have shown that among children (with and without ADHD) <b>tartrazine</b> can increase ADHD-like symptoms (see Stevens, Kuczek, Burgess, Hurt & Arnold, 2010), the general consensus is that it does not. However, it can cause allergic-type sensitivity reactions (e.g. hives and asthma) in a small number of individuals, especially those who also have a sensitivity to aspirin.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not clear}} how many {{individuals}} are sensitive or intolerant to <b>tartrazine,</b> but the University of Guelph estimates that it is 1 to 10 out of every ten thousand people (0.01% to 0.1% of the population). [...] There is much controversy about whether <b>tartrazine</b> has ill effects on individuals who are not clearly intolerant.|$|E
5000|$|The United States {{requires}} {{the presence of}} <b>tartrazine</b> to be declared on food and drug products (21 CFR 74.1705 (revised April 2013), 21 CFR 201.20) and also color batches to be preapproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As part of these regulations, the FDA requires that the Precautions section of prescription drug labels include the warning statement, [...] "This product contains FD+C Yellow No. 5 (<b>tartrazine)</b> which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD+C Yellow No. 5 (<b>tartrazine)</b> sensitivity {{in the general population}} is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity." ...|$|E

50|$|In many {{countries}} colors in cosmetics {{are listed as}} numbers from the Colour Index International. The scheme covers colors used in food, personal care products, cosmetics, household products and fabric dyeing. For example, <b>tartrazine</b> is not normally listed as such in lipstick ingredients, but as C.I. 19140. Erythrosine will be listed as C.I. 45430, and so on. In US and Canada colors are listed as FD & C colors. <b>Tartrazine</b> (E102) is FD & C Yellow 5 and erythrosine (E127) is FD & C Red 3.|$|E
