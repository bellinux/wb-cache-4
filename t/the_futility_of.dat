5|$|The {{legend of}} Mussie likely began around 1916, though folk tales claim that Canadian pioneer Samuel de Champlain {{wrote about it}} in the early seventeenth century.

5|$|Witnesses in the British {{infantry}} {{recorded as}} many as 12assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the issue of whether the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E

5|$|Albert of Aachen says William's second {{desertion}} {{occurred in}} June 1098, along with William of Grand-Mesnil, {{a relative of}} Bohemond. On the road away from Antioch, they joined Stephen of Blois, another leader of the crusade who had also fled the siege. They travelled back towards Constantinople, but on the way met Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, who was advancing to Antioch with a relief army. They convinced him of <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the crusader siege and the emperor turned back to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench.

The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Waugh had {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1930, after which his satirical, secular writings drew hostility from some Catholic quarters.

5|$|Wheelwright was {{initially}} given until March {{to leave the}} colony, but when ordered not to preach during the interim, he refused, and was then given two weeks to depart the jurisdiction.

5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking {{much of the}} drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the second}} son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father {{inherited}} the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where {{he spent much of}} the rest of his life. He became heir apparent to the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.|$|E

5|$|In the morning, Horrocks {{visited the}} Polish {{positions}} at Driel {{to see the}} front for himself. Later, he hosted a conference attended by Browning, Major-General Ivor Thomas of the 43rd (Wessex) Division and Sosabowski at Valburg. In a controversial meeting in which Sosabowski was politically outmanoeuvred, {{it was decided that}} another crossing would be attempted that night. When the Germans cut the narrow supply road near Nijmegen later that day though, it seems Horrocks realised <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the situation and plans were drawn up to withdraw the 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{attacks from}} both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups quickly {{realized}} <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E

5|$|Although the reaction, which {{included}} punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer Vietnamese serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, {{military and civilian}} authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening {{in the wake of}} the mutiny. A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. This demonstrated French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} reach the bridge began at 03:45 on the third day, 19September when the 1st and 3rd Battalions were joined by the 11th Parachute Battalion and the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. By dawn, under intense fire from the German defenders, the attack had faltered whereupon the 11th Parachute Battalion, until then held in reserve, was ordered {{to carry out a}} left {{flanking}} assault on the German line. This last attempt {{to reach the}} defenders at the bridge was subsequently stopped on the orders of General Urquhart when he realised <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the battle. By this time the 1st Parachute Battalion had been reduced to forty men and the 3rd Parachute Battalion to around the same number.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised <b>the</b> <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
