5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if <b>the</b> <b>warranty</b> had expired.|$|E
5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee.
