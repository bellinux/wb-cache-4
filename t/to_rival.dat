40|$|Research Summary: We {{examine the}} {{performance}} effects of resource orchestration in start-ups by investigating three key contingencies of resource orchestration: human capital (HC) investment relative <b>to</b> <b>rivals,</b> leveraging strategy, and founder start-up experience. We find that deviating from rivals' resource investments (either {{above or below}} the industry mean) negatively affects performance, while conforming to the norms set by rivals positively affects performance. However, we also find that a higher investment in HC relative <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> is less detrimental when aligned with a leveraging strategy focused on innovation. In addition, we find evidence that this relationship is conditioned by the entrepreneurial experience of the founders themselves. Managerial Summary: To create value, entrepreneurs need to assemble and manage various resources and capabilities. We explain how entrepreneurs can manage their resources to achieve higher performance. Using a sample of U. S. start-ups, we find that deviations in human capital (HC) investments relative <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> (either below or above) harm the performance of start-ups. However, we also find that a higher investment in HC relative <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> is less detrimental when the start-up is focused on innovation. In addition, we find that experienced founders benefit from actively orchestrating HC investments relative <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> with a strategy focused on innovation...|$|R
40|$|Responses by {{males to}} the level of sperm {{competition}} have been documented across a wide range of taxa. Recent work in Drosophila melanogaster shows that males respond adaptively to the presence of other males by making facultative adjustments to mating duration, resulting in increased transfer of ejaculate proteins, direct effects on postmating responses in females, and, ultimately, increased male competitive reproductive success. Here, we investigated how males detect the presence of rival males. We tested the effect of the length of male-to-male exposure, male age at first exposure, time since initial exposure <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> and density. We found that the longer the males were exposed <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> prior <b>to</b> mating (from 0 to 101 h of exposure), the longer their subsequent mating duration. There was no detectable effect, however, of increasing the number of rivals above 1. Increasing the density (hence encounter rate) in which males were kept had no effect on a male's response <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> and there was also no evidence that responses <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> could be evoked by a brief (2 h) time window of exposure to males at various times prior to mating. The age at which males were first exposed to other males did not affect their ability <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>rivals.</b> Taken together, our findings show that it is the absolute length of exposure <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> and not the number of rivals that is critical in determining male plastic responses to the potential level of sperm competition in D. melanogaster.

A Big Ten Network media poll, announced {{the day before}} and providing additional detail, also selected McGary and Robinson for its All-Big Ten Conference team. McGary and Robinson were on the 50-man Naismith Award and Wooden Award preseason watchlists. A poll of Big Ten beat writers also selected Michigan to edge out Ohio State for second place. Michigan began the season ninth in the preseason Coaches' Poll and seventh in the AP Poll.|$|E

TNA's previous event Sacrifice {{did not receive}} a rating, however, No Surrender, which took place prior to Sacrifice, was given an 8 out of 10 by Jason Clevett. Unbreakable was ranked lower than TNA's next event, Bound for Glory, which received a 9 out of 10 from Bob Kapur.

40|$|Diet has a {{profound}} {{direct and indirect}} effect on reproductive success in both sexes. Variation in diet quality and quantity can significantly alter the capacity of females to lay eggs and of males to deliver courtship. Here we tested the effect of dietary resource limitation {{on the ability of}} male D. melanogaster to respond adaptively <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> by extending their mating duration. Previous work done under ad libitum diet conditions showed that males exposed <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> prior <b>to</b> mating significantly extend mating duration, transfer more ejaculate proteins and achieve higher reproductive success. Such adaptive responses are predicted to occur because male ejaculate production may be limited and hence ejaculate resources require allocation across different reproductive bouts, to balance current versus future reproductive success. However, when males suffer dietary limitation, and potentially have fewer reproductive resources to apportion, we expect adaptive allocation of responses <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> <b>to</b> be minimised. We tested this prediction and found that males held on agar-only diets for 5 - 7 days lost the ability to extend mating following exposure <b>to</b> <b>rivals.</b> Interestingly, extended mating was retained in males held on low yeast/sugar: no sugar/yeast diet treatments, but was mostly lost when males were maintained on ‘imbalanced’ diets in which there was high yeast: no sugar and vice versa. Overall, the results show that males exhibit adaptive responses <b>to</b> <b>rivals</b> according <b>to</b> the degree of dietary resource limitation and to the ratio of individual diet components...|$|R

5|$|In 1790, a new Royal Opera House was {{proposed}} {{to be built}} in Leicester Square.

The opera house was never built, as the royal patent needed at that time to license a theatre was refused.
