500|$|As {{darkness}} fell at {{the close}} of Adlertag, Sperrle sent nine Kampfgruppe 100 (Bombing Group 100) He 111s to conduct a strategic bombing raid against the Supermarine Spitfire factory at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. Despite the group being a specialist night strike unit which had high expertise in night navigation, only four of the crews found their targets. The eleven [...] bombs dropped were not sufficient to disrupt fighter production. Around five of the 11 fell inside the compound. Casualties were small as workers had gone to shelter. Serious damage was done only to offices and a <b>tool</b> <b>room,</b> while a gas main was fractured. Another group, led by Gruppenkommandeur Hauptmann (Captain) Friedrich Achenbrenner, dispatched 15 He 111s from bases in Brittany across the Irish Sea to strike at the Short Brothers factory at Queen's Island, Belfast Northern Ireland. Five Short Stirling aircraft were destroyed.kg 27 also took part in the missions, and bombed Glasgow during the night although their specific target is unclear. Other bombers, commencing the night stage of Adlertag, resolutely flew the length and breadth of Great Britain, bombing Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, Liverpool, Sheffield, Norwich, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Very little damage was done, though some rail tracks were cut temporarily and around 100 casualties were suffered. It is unknown if any German aircraft were lost. One German airman was found wandering around the countryside in Balcombe, Somerset. No other traces of the aircraft or other crew members were found.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{graduating from}} high school in June 1941, Ovshinsky worked as a tool maker and {{machinist}} in various local shops affiliated with the rubber industry. During the Second World War, he and his bride, Norma Rifkin, moved to Arizona, where Ovshinsky worked for a time in the <b>tool</b> <b>room</b> of a Goodyear plant in Litchfield, not far from Phoenix. [...] Returning to Akron shortly {{before the end of the}} war, Ovshinsky eventually established his own machine company, Stanford Roberts, initially in a barn. There he developed and patented his first invention, the Benjamin Center Drive, named after his father. [...] This unique automatic high-speed center drive lathe had many important uses. [...] After Ovshinsky sold his company to the New Britain Machine Company in Connecticut, it was used to help solve the national crisis of making artillery shells in large enough volume for wartime needs during the Korean War. [...] Meanwhile, Ovshinsky continued to develop his growing interest in human and machine intelligence, avidly studying the research literature on neurophysiology, neurological disease, and cybernetics, corresponding briefly with Norbert Wiener.|$|E

When no buyer was found, O'Brien bought it himself, setting up a new business, Contract Tooling Pty Ltd (CTPL), on 27 August 1959. He remained with CTPL until he decided to retire in 1972, and sold the company. He became involved in local politics. He was elected to the Woollahra Council on 9 December 1968, and served two terms as the mayor, from 1971 to 1972, and from 1975 to 1976. He died in Darlinghurst on 27 May 1980, and was buried in the South Head Cemetery in Bronte. A memorial service was held at St Mary Magdalene Church in Rose Bay.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{supply of}} {{manufactured}} products depends on tool, die and mould (TDM) manufacturing. The TDM industry provides the machines, {{tools and equipment}} necessary to produce most manufactured components. The TDM industry is a high value-adding constituent in the supply of manufactured products by being {{at the heart of}} component manufacturing and by forming the backbone of the manufacturing sector. Unfortunately, the South African TDM industry experienced a steady economic decline during the last decade. This decline resulted in a negative effect on the domestic manufacturing industry. The South African government realised the evident need to restructure and develop the TDM industry. This research forms part of government incentives to increase global competitiveness of the South African TDM industry. The South African TDM industry lacks the capacity to supply in the local demand. This study determines shortfalls and the need for improvement by comparing the South African industry against its global counterparts. A benchmarking methodology is developed to identify improvement plans for individual <b>tool</b> <b>rooms</b> and for the industry as a whole. Recommendations for the domestic industry are provided through conclusions drawn from the study. The benchmarking methodology can be applied to an industry or to an individual concern. A pilot implementation of the methodology was performed in three specific <b>tool</b> <b>rooms.</b> This thesis analysis the South African TDM industry in its entirety and provides recommendations to improve competitiveness...|$|R
