40|$|Evaluation of {{precipitation}} at the serra do mar-sp during events with different intensity and duration. The Serra do Mar, in its longest part {{along the shore}} of the state of Sao Paulo, has, as one of its most distinctive climatologic traits, the influence of orography in the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> {{of precipitation}}. The configuration of obstacle and the action of atmospheric systems are responsible for <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of precipitation significantly different throughout its profile which, by its own right, presents different relief compartments, such as the Baixada Santista and the humid slopes of the hills and its countryside edge. The analysis of a series of precipitation events distributed according to intensity and duration shows the influence of orography by promoting <b>total</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> that are among the highest ones in Brazil, up to areas with <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> which, once compared to the amounts of the humid slopes, prove to be areas with rain shadows. In four events chosen throughout the year of 2005 utilizing five pluviometric posts, it has been analyzed both the hourly evolution and the accumulated precipitation for high and low intensity and also for long and short duration. The selected events show that the intensification of the orography happens, mostly, with association of atmospheric systems and the position of the measuring posts. Therefore, it has been noticed that during short duration events the variation of the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of precipitation is significantly inferior to the spatial variation during the long duration events, once that, during short duration events, convective systems are predominant whereas, during long duration events, the predominance is of frontal systems, having been registered much higher <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of precipitation in the posts which were facing the ocean compared to those which were in the countryside posts...|$|R

5|$|Early in {{its life}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, Ewiniar affected Yap and Palau, which fall under the warning jurisdiction of the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5feet (1.5m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. The <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of damage caused {{was estimated to be}} just over $100 thousand (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E
40|$|With Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and trend {{analysis}} method adopted, the spatio-temporal variation of <b>total</b> cloud <b>amount</b> is analyzed for 75 stations on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau {{during the period}} 1971 - 2004. Analysis indicates that the <b>total</b> cloud <b>amount</b> decreases from the southeast to the northwest of the plateau, and that the annual and seasonal variations in <b>total</b> cloud <b>amount</b> both show an apparent declining tendency over the past decades. Correlation analysis demonstrates that the <b>total</b> cloud <b>amount</b> is negative with sunshine duration and diurnal temperature range (DTR), and is positive with precipitation and the relative humidity, respectively. The negative correlation {{is consistent with the}} radiative effect of cloud, while the positive correlation between <b>total</b> cloud <b>amount</b> and precipitation is obscured because of the influence of topographic factors. Discussion implies that the decrease of <b>total</b> cloud <b>amount</b> is possibly due to the variation of atmospheric aerosol content and ozone concentration over the plateau, although it is difficult to quantify the driving force mechanism up to now...|$|R

5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of enzyme.|$|E
