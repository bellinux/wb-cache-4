The hydrology of the Tonle Sap is {{directly linked to}} water levels of the Mekong River, which will experience major alterations {{as a response to}} hydropower development, irrigation, and climate change. This paper proposes a landscape approach to understand the impacts of hydrological alteration on the floodplain’s <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation.</b> A land <b>cover</b> map, a digital elevation map and historical water records were used to create histograms of water depth for key vegetation communities. These histograms were used to create maps of vegetation coverage probability for future scenarios of hydrological changes.

40|$|A 2. 5 -dimensional {{climate system}} model of {{intermediate}} complexity CLIMBER- 2 and its performance for present climate conditions are presented. The model consists of modules describing atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land surface processes, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover,</b> and global carbon cycle. The modules interact (on-line) through the fluxes of momentum, energy, water and carbon. The model has a coarse spatial resolution, allowing nevertheless {{to capture the}} major features of the Earth's geography. The model describes temporal variability of the system on seasonal and longer time scales. Due {{to the fact that}} the model does not employ any type of flux adjustment and has fast turnaround time, it can be used for study of climates significantly different from the present one and allows to perform long-term (multimillennia) simulations. The constraints for coupling the atmosphere and ocean without flux adjustment are discussed. The results of a model validation against present climate data show that the model successfully describes the seasonal variability of a large set of characteristics of the climate system, including radiative balance, temperature, precipitation, ocean circulation and cryosphere.

40|$|International audienceHere we {{perform a}} {{detailed}} comparison between climate model results and climate reconstructions in western Europe and the Mediterranean {{area for the}} mid-Piacenzian warm interval (ca 3 Myr ago) of the Late Pliocene epoch. This region is particularly well suited for such a comparison as several quantitative climate estimates from local pollen records are available. They show evidence for temperatures significantly warmer than today over the whole area, mean annual precipitation higher in northwestern Europe and equivalent to modern values in its southwestern part. To improve our comparison, we have performed high resolution simulations of the mid-Piacenzian climate using the LMDz atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a stretched grid which allows a finer resolution over Europe. In a first step, we applied the PRISM 2 (Pliocene Research, Interpretation, and Synoptic Mapping) boundary conditions except that we used modern terrestrial vegetation. Second, we simulated the vegetation for this period by forcing the ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems) dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) with the climatic outputs from the AGCM.

40|$|Increased {{concentrations}} of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC), often labelled “browning”, is a current trend in northern, particularly boreal, freshwaters. The browning {{has been attributed to}} the recent reduction in sulphate (S) deposition during the last 2 to 3 decades. Over the last century, climate and land use change have also caused an increasing trend in <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> (“greening”), and this terrestrially fixed carbon represents another potential source for export of organic carbon to lakes and rivers. The impact of this greening on the observed browning of lakes and rivers on decadal time scales remains poorly investigated, however.

40|$|INTERDYNAMIK {{thematic}} workshop on vegetation dynamics Workshop rationale The geographical distribution of dominant land plant forms is mainly controlled by climate. If climate alters, the <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> closely follows {{the change in}} the climatic patterns. In turn, changes in spatial distribution and composition of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> alter the climate through modifications of heat and water fluxes, atmospheric gas and aerosol composition.

Analysis of climate-biosphere feedbacks and their role in the climate system dynamics during Quaternary is a new, rapidly developing scientific field that relies on climate system modeling and proxy data analysis.

40|$|Values of deltaC- 13 {{obtained}} from conventional bulk sediment radiocarbon dates encompassing the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary have been compiled and plotted against C- 14 age. In all, 286 lake sediment dates from southern Sweden {{in the range}} 8, 000 to 13. 000 BP have been evaluated. A significant decrease in deltaC- 13 values, initiated shortly before 10, 000 BP and amounting to 5 parts per thousand, is distinguished. This change is accompanied by increased limnic productivity, decreased erosive input and increased organic carbon content of the sediments. A probable explanation for the deltaC- 13 decline in organic material is decreased importance of dissolution of silicates at {{the transition to the}} Holocene. During the Late Weichselian, extensive weathering of exposed minerogenic material with subsequent input of bicarbonate to the lake water may have caused a relative enrichment of C- 13 in dissolved inorganic carbon. Furthermore, the early Holocene increase in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> probably led to an increased supply of C- 13 depleted carbon dioxide to the lake water by root respiration. Altered limnic vegetation, presumably towards increased production of phytoplankton, could also have contributed to the observed decreasing deltaC- 13 trend.

Charcoal contained in sediments has been widely used {{as a proxy for}} biomass burning and human activities as well as climate change. Charcoal and soot in Cenozoic marine sediments at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition (Exp.) 346 Site U 1423 were measured to examine the regional history of biomass burning in East Asia. Charcoal and soot were measured as elemental carbon (EC) in coarse (>[*] 2  μm) and fine (<[*] 2  μm) fractions using grain size separation by repeated settling followed by application of a thermal optical transmittance (TOT) method. Organic carbon (OC) was also quantified during the process. EC and OC in both coarse and fine fractions are higher from 0 to 1.8  Ma and lower from 1.8 to 4.3  Ma but have large variations, which suggest more frequent or intense biomass burning since 1.8  Ma. Terrestrial biomass and precipitation could be major controls on the EC supply. Fine EC varies independently from coarse EC, which suggests a remote origin of fine EC. Large increases in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> have led to high-temperature burning, which is associated with interglacial stages.|$|E

In this study, we compare sea-air CO 2  fluxes from the Time-Dependent Inverse (TDI) atmosphere model and the marine Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) model to study the processes involved in ocean carbon cycling at subbasin scales. A dust generation and transport model, based on analyzed meteorology and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover,</b> {{is also used to}} estimate the interannual variability in dust and iron deposition to different ocean basins. Overall, a fairly good agreement is established between the TDI and BEC model results for the net annual patterns and seasonal cycle of sea-air CO 2  exchange. Sensitivity studies with the ocean biogeochemical model using increased or reduced atmospheric iron inputs indicate the relative sensitivity of air-sea CO 2  exchange. The simulated responses to changes in iron inputs are not instantaneous (peak response after ∼ 2 − 3 years). The TDI model derived seasonal cycles for the Southern Ocean (South Atlantic) are better matched by the BEC model by increasing (decreasing) iron inputs through atmospheric aerosols. Our results suggest that some of the interannual variability in TDI model air-sea CO 2  fluxes during the past decade may be explainable by dust variability that relaxes/increases iron limitation in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean regions...|$|E

Using the polarimetric ground-based SAR (GB-SAR) system, we carried out measurements on a spe-cific vegetation cover pertinent to the remote sensing of forested regions within Sendai City, consisting of three different kinds of trees common within the Kawauchi Campus of Tohoku Uni-versity. Measurements were collected in spring, summer, and autumn. Three-dimensional (3 -D) polarization-sensitive images were reconstructed from the acquired data. Analysis of the 3 -D polarimetric images of each measurement found differences (at times strong differences) among the polarization signatures. There were stronger reflections {{in all of the}} HH, VH, VV images in the second (summer) measurement, especially in the VH image, due to the substantial growth of branches and leaves in summer. This ground-truth validation system provided valuable information about the scattering mechanisms of the three trees selected for analysis in different seasons, which can be detected by broadband polarimetric ground-based SAR measurements. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent polarimetric performance of the newly developed SAR imaging system, which should find many useful and immediate applications in noninvasive ground-truth validation of diverse terrestrial vegetation covers.

30|$|In the past, {{studies of}} {{vegetation}} change {{were based on}} traditional methods such as field observations, which {{made it possible to}} assess point or local vegetation change with high accuracy, but were limited in understanding large-scale changes. With the development of earth observation and satellite technology, remote sensing has provided an efficient source of data, especially for vegetation index data from which vegetation change information can be extracted efficiently and cheaply for large areas (Dengsheng 2006; Bao et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2015). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is derived from reflectance measurements in the red and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, is a vegetation index that shows leave volume, utilizing characteristic reflection and absorption of chlorophyll in plants (Pinty and Verstraete 1992; Leprieur et al. 2000). Higher NDVI values indicate higher concentrations of green vegetation, while lower NDVI values indicate less vegetated areas. Phenological variations of vegetation or ecosystem changes {{will have an impact on}} vegetation coverage, which is reflected in a change of the NDVI value. Animations using NDVI time series data can show the seasonal change of vegetation. As one of the important vegetation dynamic detection programs, the SPOT-VEGETATION program allows daily monitoring of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> at regional or global scales (Trichon et al. 1999). The instrument and associated ground services for data archival, processing, and distribution have been operational since April 1998. Processing of SPOT-VEGETATION data includes improved navigation, atmospheric correction, reduced geometric distortions, and improved radiometric sensitivity (Gobron et al. 2000; Rasmus et al. 2006). SPOT-VEGETATION data have been widely used for detecting vegetation change, land use/cover, and vegetation conditions. Stephen et al. (Boles et al. 2004) conducted a land cover characterization of temperate East Asia using SPOT-VEGETATION data. Immerzeel et al. (2005) analyzed the interaction between precipitation and land use in Tibet using SPOT-VEGETATION S 10 NDVI time series and Vebesselt et al.

40|$|Satellite {{image data}} {{have become an}} {{important}} source of information for monitoring vegetation and mapping land cover at several scales. Beside this, the distribution and phenology of vegetation is largely associated with climate, terrain characteristics and human activity. Various vegetation indices have been developed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of vegetation using remote spectral measurements. In particular, sensors with spectral bands in the red (RED) and near-infrared (NIR) lend themselves well to vegetation monitoring and based on them [(NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED) ] Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widespread used. Given that the characteristics of spectral bands in RED and NIR vary distinctly from sensor to sensor, NDVI values based on data from different instruments will not be directly comparable. The spatial resolution also varies significantly between sensors, as well as within a given scene in the case of wide-angle and oblique sensors. As a result, NDVI values will vary according to combinations of the heterogeneity and scale of terrestrial surfaces and pixel footprint sizes. Therefore, the question arises as to the impact of differences in spectral and spatial resolutions on vegetation indices like the NDVI and their interpretation as a drought index. During 2012 three locations (at Salamanca, Granada and Córdoba) were selected and a periodic pasture monitoring and botanic composition were achieved. Daily precipitation, temperature and monthly soil water content were measurement as well as fresh and dry pasture weight. At the same time, remote sensing images were capture by DEIMOS- 1 and MODIS of the chosen places. DEIMOS- 1 is based on the concept Microsat- 100 from Surrey. It is conceived for obtaining Earth images with a good enough resolution to study the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> (20 x 20 m), although with a great range of visual field (600 km) in order to obtain those images with high temporal resolution and at a reduced cost.

Comparison of the simulated winter and summer temperatures to pollen-based estimates show some disparities, in particular in the northern Mediterranean sector. The latitudinal distribution of precipitation depicted by pollen data over land is not reproduced by the model.

40|$|Information on {{the state}} of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> is {{important}} for several ecological, economical, and planning issues. In this regard, vegetation properties such as the type, vitality, or density can be described by means of continuous biophysical parameters. One of these parameters is the leaf area index (LAI), which is defined as half the total leaf area per unit ground surface area. As leaves constitute the interface between the biosphere and the atmosphere, the LAI is used to model exchange processes between plants and their environment. However, to account for the variability of ecosystems, spatially and temporally explicit information on LAI is needed both for monitoring and modeling applications. Remote sensing aims at providing such information. LAI is commonly derived from remote sensing data by empirical-statistical or physical models. In the first approach, an empirical relationship between LAI measured in situ and the corresponding canopy spectral signature is established. Although this method achieves accurate LAI estimates, these relationships are only valid for the place and time at which the field data were sampled, which hampers automated LAI derivation. The physical approach uses a radiation transfer model to simulate canopy reflectance as a function of the scene’s geometry and of leaf and canopy parameters, from which LAI is derived through model inversion based on remote sensing data. However, this model inversion is not stable, as it is an under-determined and ill-posed problem. Until now, LAI research focused either on the use of coarse resolution remote sensing data for global applications, or on LAI modeling over a confined area, mostly in forest and crop ecosystems, using medium to high spatial resolution data. This is why to date no study is available in which high spatial resolution data are used for LAI mapping in a heterogeneous, natural landscape such as alpine grasslands, although a growing amount of high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data would allow for an improved environmental monitoring. Therefore, issues related to model parameterization and inversion regularization techniques improving its stability have not yet been investigated for this ecosystem. This research gap was taken up by this thesis, in which the potential of high spatial resolution remote sensing data for grassland LAI estimation based on statistical and radiation transfer modeling is analyzed, and the achieved accuracy and robustness of the two approaches is compared. The objectives were an ecosystem-adapted radiation transfer model set-up and an optimized LAI derivation in mountainous grassland areas. Multi-temporal LAI in situ measurements as well as time series of RapidEye data from 2011 and 2012 over the catchment of the River Ammer in the Bavarian alpine upland were used. In order to obtain accurate in situ data, a comparison of the LAI derivation algorithms implemented in the LAI- 2000 PCA instrument with destructively measured LAI was performed first. For optimizing the empirical-statistical approach, it was then analyzed how the selection of vegetation indices and regression models impacts LAI modeling, and how well these models can be transferred to other dates. It was shown that LAI can be derived with a mean accuracy of 80...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the highest}} rates of global warming are {{occurring}} in high southern latitudes (ca. 0. 25 ?C per decade, Jones 1988). The effect of this warming on the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> is not yet fully understood. Using an altitudinal temperature gradient as an analogy to temperature change a study has been initiated with the aim of predicting the effects of climate warming on subantarctic Macquarie Island's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation.</b> The study applies a multidisciplinary approach and focuses on the functional ecology of six key vascular plant species.

40|$|Detailed {{mapping of}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> types is often {{required}} in various environmental study projects. Very high-resolution satellites, e. g. IKONOS, {{are expected to}} provide a new opportunity to make detailed <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> maps efficiently for large study areas. This paper reports the methodology of the <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> mapping using IKONOS data for a watershed management project in south-western Japan. In this study, we examined spectral, geometric, and textual properties of image objects extracted through both object-based and pixel-based image classification of IKONOS panchromatic, mulit-spectral, and pan-sharpen images {{of the study area}} to check whether <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> types in the study area are distinguishable using IKONOS data. The result of the analysis shows that, in conjunction with spectral information, textural and geometric information of image objects extracted from IKONOS data provide useful information for detailed <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> classification. Based on the analysis, we developed a multi-scale object-based image analysis method for <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> mapping using IKONOS data. Applying the multi-scale analysis to IKONOS images, a <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> map of the study area was obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{discusses}} a method {{used to produce}} updated information about <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> in arid and semi-arid zones, using RS data and GIS technique. In this method, Landsat ETM+ data in 2002 was collected {{in an area of}} about 60000 ha in Nodoushan basin, Yazd, Iran. To collect the necessary ground data, 50 sites of different vegetation types were selected and the percentage of <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> in each one was determined. Also, different vegetation and soil indices were derived and crossed with located sampling points using ILWIS software capabilities. To get the best fitted curve, the relationship between <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover,</b> as a dependent variable, and satellite data bands, vegetation indices and environmental factors, as independent variables were assessed. Therefore, a multiple linear regression model was established for the prediction of <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> percentage in the studied area. Finally, a <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> map with high a precision was produced. As a conclusion, {{it can be said that}} mapping of <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> via remote sensing is possible even if its <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> is sparse...|$|R
40|$|Spatiotemporal {{variations}} of Chinese Loess Plateau <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> during 1981 - 2006 {{have been investigated}} using GIMMS and SPOT VGT NDVI data {{and the cause of}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> changes has been analyzed, considering the climate changes and human activities. <b>Vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> changes on the Loess Plateau have experienced four stages as follows: (1) <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> showed a continued increasing phase during 1981 - 1989; (2) <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> changes came into a relative steady phase with small fluctuations during 1990 - 1998; (3) <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> declined rapidly during 1999 - 2001; and (4) <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> increased rapidly during 2002 - 2006. The <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> changes of the Loess Plateau show a notable spatial difference. The <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> has obviously increased in the Inner Mongolia and Ningxia plain along the Yellow River and the ecological rehabilitated region of Ordos Plateau, however the <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> evidently decreased in the hilly and gully areas of Loess Plateau, Liupan Mountains region and the northern hillside of Qinling Mountains. The response of NDVI to climate changes varied with different vegetation types. NDVI of sandy land vegetation, grassland and cultivated land show a significant increasing trend, but forest shows a decreasing trend. The results obtained in this study show that the spatiotemporal {{variations of}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> are the outcome of climate changes and human activities. Temperature is a control factor of the seasonal change of vegetation growth. The increased temperature makes soil drier and unfavors vegetation growth in summer, but it favors vegetation growth in spring and autumn because of a longer growing period. There is a significant correlation between <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> and precipitation and thus, the change in precipitation is an important factor for vegetation variation. The improved agricultural production has resulted in an increase of NDVI in the farmland, and the implementation of large-scale vegetation construction has led to some beneficial effect in ecology. © Science in China Press 2008...|$|R
40|$|Achieving global {{targets for}} {{restoring}} native <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> requires restoration projects {{to identify and}} work toward common management objectives. This is made challenging by the different values held by concerned stakeholders, which are not often accounted for. Additionally, restoration is time-dependent {{and yet there is}} often little explicit acknowledgment of the time frames required to achieve outcomes. Here, we argue that explicitly incorporating value and time considerations into stated objectives would help to achieve restoration goals. We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature on restoration of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vegetation</b> and found that while there is guidance on how to identify and account for stakeholder values and time considerations, there is little evidence these are being incorporated into decision-making processes. In this article, we explore how a combination of stakeholder surveys and workshops can be used within a structured decision-making framework to facilitate the integration of diverse stakeholder values and time frame considerations to set restoration objectives. We demonstrate this approach with a case of restoration decision-making at a regional scale (southeast Queensland, Australia) with a view to this experience supporting similar restoration projects elsewhere...|$|R
