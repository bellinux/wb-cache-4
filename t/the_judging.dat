5|$|Although most of <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> {{had been}} {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E

However, at the medal ceremony he walked off the podium and dropped his medal on the mat in protest of <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> in his event. On August 16, 2008, the International Olympic Committee decided to strip him of his medal because they felt it amounted to a political demonstration and was disrespectful to other athletes.|$|E

5|$|German Georg Hackl won {{a silver}} in the singles luge, {{becoming}} the first athlete in Olympic history to win medals in the same individual event in five consecutive Olympics. Canada achieved an unprecedented double by winning both the men's and women's ice hockey gold medals. Canada became embroiled with Russia in a controversy that involved <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> of the pairs figure skating competition. The Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze competed against the Canadian pair of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier for the gold medal. The Canadians appeared to have skated well enough to win the competition, yet the Russians were awarded the gold. <b>The</b> <b>judging</b> broke along Cold War lines with judges from former Communist countries favouring the Russian pair and judges from Western nations voting for the Canadians. The only exception was the French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, who awarded the gold to the Russians. An investigation revealed {{that she had been}} pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated; in return the Russian judge would look favourably on the French entrants in the ice dancing competition. The IOC decided to award both pairs the gold medal in a second medal ceremony held later in the Games. Australian Steven Bradbury became the first gold medallist from the southern hemisphere when he won the 1,000metre short-track speed skating event.|$|E

Rae had some academic success in student exhibitions, receiving prizes and recognition from <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> panel on several occasions, alongside fellow students such as Longstaff, Frederick McCubbin, Jane Sutherland and May Vale. Rae joined, and exhibited with, the Victorian Academy of Arts between 1881 and 1883.|$|E
50|$|In serious {{criminal}} cases (such as murder) appearing before the High Court, two assessors may be appointed to assist <b>the</b> <b>judge.</b> Assessors are usually advocates or retired magistrates.

At {{the end of the}} court case they give <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> their opinion. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> does not have to listen to the assessors' opinions but it usually helps <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> to make a decision.

April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being disgusted with the concept of a beauty contest. She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date. She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E

5|$|Takanohana {{became a}} judge of tournament bouts in February 2004, {{only a year}} after his retirement, a role for which elders {{normally}} have to wait at least four years. After {{the election of the}} Association's Board of Directors in February 2008, the Association appointed Takanohana as , replacing former yokozuna Chiyonofuji (Kokonoe-oyakata) who was elected to serve the Board as a director. For an organization that tends to follow seniority over achievement in its organization appointment, it was highly unusual for them to place a 35-year-old to such an influential position. However both former yokozuna, Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji whom Takanohana is often compared to, served a stint as Associate Manager of Judging prior to their becoming the Board director. In February 2009 he was moved from <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> department to the jungyō (regional tour) department, a less high-profile position.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} generally {{impressed the}} viewing public, although its subject matter repelled many, thus denying Géricault the popular acclaim {{which he had}} hoped to achieve. At the end of the exhibition, the painting was awarded a gold medal by <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> panel, but they did not give the work the greater prestige of selecting it for the Louvre's national collection. Instead, Géricault was awarded a commission {{on the subject of the}} Sacred Heart of Jesus, which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, whose finished painting he then signed as his own. Géricault retreated to the countryside, where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his unsold work was rolled up and stored in a friend's studio.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 1524, five cantons, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Zug, {{formed an}} alliance, die fünf Orte (the Five States) to defend {{themselves}} from Zwingli's Reformation. They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including John Eck, who had debated Luther in the Leipzig Disputation of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> authority, {{the location of the}} debate, {{and the use of the}} Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to Baden. Although Zurich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by Johannes Oecolampadius of Basel, a theologian from Württemberg who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, Glarus, Solothurn, Fribourg, and Appenzell as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Zurich supported him.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a permanent building for the Memorial was delayed by the Great Depression. In January 1924 the Commonwealth Government's Cabinet approved a proposal to construct the War Memorial {{at the foot of}} Mount Ainslie in Canberra. An architectural competition was subsequently held, and Treloar was responsible for selecting the final designs to be considered after <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> panel had reduced the number of entries from 69 to 29. None of these designs met all the necessary criteria, but two of the architects responsible for highly placed designs agreed to collaborate to produce a final design. Plans for the Memorial building were approved by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1928, but funds for construction work were not available due to the impact of the Great Depression. Work finally began on the building in 1933, and it was completed in 1941. Until 1935, Treloar and the Memorial's administrative staff were located in Melbourne while the collection was split between Sydney and Melbourne. In that year, Treloar, along with 24 other Memorial staff, moved into the uncompleted building in Canberra and the Memorial in Sydney was closed to enable the collection to be relocated.|$|E
