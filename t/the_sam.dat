40|$|The Segment Alignment Maintenance System (SAMs) was {{installed}} on McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) in August 2001. <b>The</b> <b>SAMs</b> became fully operational in October 2001. <b>The</b> <b>SAMs</b> uses {{a system of}} 480 inductive edge sensors to correct misalignments of the HET's 91 primary mirror segments when the segments are perturbed from their aligned reference positions.

40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) {{of three}} n-alkanethiols, 1 -octadecanethiol (C 18 SH), 1 -dodecanethiol (C 12 SH), and 1 -hexanethiol (C 6 SH), were formed on fresh, oxide-free copper {{surfaces}} obtained by HNO 3 etching. The corrosion protection abilities of <b>the</b> three alkanethiol <b>SAMs</b> were evaluated in 0. 2 mol cm- 3 NaCl, 0. 2 mol cm- 3 HCl and 0. 2 mol dm- 3 H 2 SO 4 solutions using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. <b>The</b> <b>SAMs</b> {{act as a}} hydrophobic barrier layer, which effectively prevents the copper substrate from contacting corrosive ions, thereby inhibiting corrosion of the copper to a considerable degree. A general equivalent circuit for the SAM-covered electrodes was proposed, by means of which the impedance behavior of the electrodes was interpreted and the corresponding electrochemical parameters were acquired. In addition, the quality of <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> and development of defects in <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> were also been evaluated based on the equivalent circuit.

30|$|Firstly, the {{functionalized}} nanotubes {{formed an}} irregular densely packed monolayer in <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> (Figure 6 A), which {{was similar to}} that of the pythio-MWNT LB films deposited at about 20 mN/m [17]. This image provided a direct evidence for <b>the</b> formation of <b>SAMs</b> of <b>the</b> nanotubes. Secondly, after <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> were immersed in the solution of Cyt c, more dense and larger aggregates contained in nanotubes were observed in the 2 D SEM image (Figure 6 B), which may be attributed to the reason that the protein was adsorbed on <b>the</b> pythio-MWNT <b>SAMs.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Mastiff RPVs went {{in first}} {{to cause the}} Syrian SAMs to turn on their radars by convincing the Syrians that many attack {{aircraft}} were overhead. Once the Mastiffs were tracked by Syrian radar, the tracking signals were relayed to another Scout outside of the missiles' range. The Scout then relayed the signal to E2C Hawkeye aircraft orbiting off the coast. The data gathered was analyzed by the E2Cs and Boeing 707 ECM aircraft. Once <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> crews fired missiles at the drones, the F-15s and F-16s provided air cover while F-4 Phantoms attacked <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> batteries, destroying them with AGM-78 and AGM-45 anti-radiation missiles. The rapid flight time of the missiles minimized the F-4s' exposure to the SAMs. The Syrians reportedly fired 57 SA-6s, to no effect.|$|E

30|$|The height {{profiles}} {{obtained from}} the AFM images were shown in Figure 7 C,D. These curves indicated that the height of most aggregates in <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> of pythio-MWNTs was around 3 nm. When the protein was adsorbed on <b>the</b> <b>SAMs,</b> <b>the</b> average height of the aggregates increased, with some domains reaching as high as 6 nm. These data further confirmed that the Cyt c was adsorbed {{on the surface of}} pythio-MWNTs.|$|R
30|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of pyridylthio-functionalized multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (pythio-MWNTs) {{have been}} constructed on the gold substrate surface, which were used as a support to immobilize cytochrome c (Cyt c). The assembly processes of <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> and adsorption of Cyt c were monitored by using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Based on the frequency change of the QCM resonator, the surface coverage for <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> of pythio-MWNTs {{was estimated to be}} about 5.2 μg/cm 2, and that of the Cyt c adsorbed was about 0.29 μg/cm 2. For the gold electrode modified by <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> of pythio-MWNTs-Cyt c, a quasi-reversible redox wave was recorded with the cathodic and anodic potentials at about − 0.55 and − 0.28 V vs Ag/AgCl, respectively. Compositions and morphologies of <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> before and after immobilization of Cyt c were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy.|$|R
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E
5|$|A British mission led by Akers {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} gaseous diffusion technology at <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> Laboratories in New York. Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with that of the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} density {{functional}} theory {{study of the}} structure and stability of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkylthiolate on Au(111) {{as a function of}} the alkyl chain length. The most favorable structure of <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> involves an RS−Au−SR complex (S being sulfur, R being an alkyl chain) formed through sandwiching one Au adatom by two alkylthiolates (RSs). Comparing a generalized gradient (GGA-PBE) and a meta-GGA (MGGA-M 06 -L) exchange-correlation functional we find that only the meta-GGA functional predicts the experimentally observed attractive intermolecular interactions within <b>the</b> <b>SAMs.</b> In particular, <b>the</b> use of M 06 -L yields an increased stability of <b>the</b> <b>SAMs</b> with increasing alkyl chain length and an increased attractive interaction between RS−Au−SR complexes at shorter distances...|$|R

A squadron of Tadiran Mastiff and IAI Scout Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV) kept at least two vehicles in the air all the time, providing constant location of <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> batteries. A two-way voice communications link between Ivry and his pilots was set up, allowing for real-time command.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Wu {{joined the}} Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University.

Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|Ivry {{received}} {{the green light}} at 10:00 AM to execute the operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft.

5|$|Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex {{had made}} {{researchers}} at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not {{taking advantage of the}} latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also be taken with the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at <b>the</b> <b>SAM</b> Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.|$|E
