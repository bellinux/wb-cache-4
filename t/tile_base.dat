Tile based streaming has been proposed {{in the past and}} is drawing {{a lot of attention to}} provide a solution that scales well. In <b>tile</b> <b>base</b> streaming the video is divided into multiple tiles and a subset of tiles of interest is transmitted to the viewer. We propose a low-complexity compressed domain video processing technique, which uses H. 265 /SHVC and generates a single video bitstream from the selected tiles so that single hardware decoders can be used to decode the RoI video stream. Additionally, the proposed technique makes it possible to use Open GOP structures in the output layer without incurring in any interruption at switching events, which provides a better compression efficiency compared to closed GOP structures...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliogaphic references. This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the Mesozoic geological history of the Agulhas Bank on the continental shelf off the south coast of South Africa. It incorporates the results of oil exploration activities in the area since 1967 : this involved the drilling of 17 boreholes (43 000 m) and the recording of about 24 000 line km of seismic reflection profiles. A structural investigation was facilitated by regional mapping of two key seismic reflectors; these are acoustic basement (horizon D at <b>tile</b> <b>base</b> of the Mesozoic) and a prominent reflector and unconformable horizon (horizon C) within the Lower Cretaceous. An additional two horizons were mapped over part of the Agulhas Bank; they are horizons A (base of the Uppper Cretaceous) and 11 (within the Lower Cretaceous). These reflector horizons were tied to stratigraphic control points in the boreholes. A stratigraphic framework was erected and correlations were established by means of a study of borehole cuttings samples, cores and sidewall cores and a variety of wireline logs. The existing Mesozoic litho-stratrigraphic framework was supplemented by defining reference stratotypes for the Swart¬kops end Sundays River formations. Subsurface stratotypes are defined for two new units; they are termed the Infanta and Alphard Formations. A subsurface reference stratotype for the Alexandria Formation is presented. A chronostratigrapic framework and correlations, which became available through a study of microfauna and microflora were intergrated with structural and lithostratigraphic information. As a consequence four litho-tectonic units are recognised; their evolution is discussed also in terms of varying rates of sediment accumulation. The Mesozoic geologic history of the Agulhas bank is discussed in reference to the plate tectonic history...|$|E

40|$|Panoramic {{streaming}} is {{a particular}} way of video streaming where an arbitrary Region-of-Interest (RoI) of high-spatial resolution videos is transmitted. It allows users to navigate interactively around the video and thus select anytime the portion of it they are interested in. The most basic approach consists of each user interacting with the system indicating the desired RoI. Then an encoder associated with each user encodes the desired RoI. However, such a system does not scale well. Instead, we consider <b>tile</b> <b>based</b> panoramic streaming, where users receive a set of tiles that match their RoI, and propose a low-complexity compressed domain video processing technique for <b>tile</b> <b>based</b> panoramic streaming using H. 265 /HEVC that generates a single video bitstream out of the selected tiles so that single hardware decoders {{can be used to}} decode the RoI video stream...|$|R

The {{methods that}} are {{employed}} are subcarrier based, user separation <b>based,</b> <b>tile</b> <b>based</b> with known <b>tile</b> size, and <b>tile</b> <b>based</b> with estimated <b>tile</b> size. It is {{observed that the}} subcarrier-based method yields the worst performance, while the tile-based method performs the best. Therefore, if the tile size is not known, instead of employing the subcarrier-based method, first the proposed tile size estimation can be performed and then the tile-based detection method can be applied. Given that the proposed tile size estimation for this small block size is very accurate, this way, the detection performance can be made as good as in the known tile size case. User separation-based method is seen to introduce some errors and to degrade the performance when the threshold is optimum. If the optimum threshold is not available and an intuitive value such as 0.5 is employed, however, then the user separation-based method improves the performance.|$|R

This led to the role of Geographic Information Systems/GIS becoming very crucial in the governance of Indonesia. However, implementation of GIS in Indonesia is not yet widespread. The study by Ramadhan et al (2011), from 91 E-Government systems that were examined, only 19 % are implementing GIS. One of the possible constraints might be infrastructure problems, which is narrow bandwidth hence resulting in high response time.

We design Hessenberg, tridiagonal, and bidiagonal reductions that use banded intermediate forms, and perform only asymptotically optimal numbers of I/Os; these are the first I/O optimal algorithms for these problems. In particular, we show that known slab based algorithms for two sided reductions all have suboptimal asymptotic I/O performances, even though they have been reported to do better than the traditional algorithms on the basis of empirical evidence. We propose new <b>tile</b> <b>based</b> variants of multishift QR and QZ algorithms that under certain conditions on the number of shifts, have better seek and I/O complexities than all known variants.
