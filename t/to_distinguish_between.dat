5|$|Different AtPeps {{may allow}} A. thaliana <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> {{different}} pathogens. When inoculated with a fungus, oomycete and a bacterium, {{the increases in}} AtPep expression varied depending on the pathogen. A. thaliana overexpressing AtProPep1 was more resistant to the oomycete Phythium irregulare.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} {{before the court}} was whether [...] "incapable of distinguishing right from wrong" [...] refers <b>to</b> <b>distinguishing</b> <b>between</b> moral right and moral wrong, vs. being able <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> what is legal from what is not legal.|$|R
5|$|Pneumonia is {{typically}} diagnosed {{based on a}} combination of physical signs and a chest X-ray. However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> bacterial and non-bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or anhydrous is {{used when}} referring to iron(III) chloride, <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> the two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3⋅6H2O. It may also be given as trans-Cl⋅2H2O and the systematic name tetraaquadichloroiron(III) chloride dihydrate, which more clearly represents its structure.|$|E
5|$|The most {{interesting}} aspects of Irish phonotactics {{revolve around the}} behavior of consonant clusters. Here it is important <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> clusters that occur at the beginnings of words and those that occur after vowels, although there is overlap between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion that}} it is a simple matter <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> the yield of natural agents and that of {{improvements}} is fanciful and confusing.... The objective classification of land and capital as natural and artificial agents is a task that always must transcend the human power of discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of Plymouth used terms <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> the earliest settlers {{of the colony}} and those that came later. The first generation of settlers, generally thought to be those that arrived before 1627, called themselves the Old Comers or Planters. Later generations of Plymouth residents referred to this group as the Forefathers.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E

5|$|A yoga {{system that}} predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> {{the nature of the}} early Jain school and elements derived from other schools. Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|By 1879, English law began <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> {{suicide and}} homicide, {{although}} suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate. In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England {{and by the}} middle of the 20th century, suicide had become legal in much of the western world. The term suicide first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.|$|E

40|$|What does “interdisciplinarity” {{actually}} mean? Gabriele Bammer argues lumping interdisciplinary {{work together}} may be prohibiting an effective evaluation {{of how this}} kind of research is faring. A much more intuitive approach is needed <b>to</b> <b>distinguishing</b> <b>between</b> aspects of diverse research practices. Furthermore, developing effective professional organisations is also a key task for moving interdisciplinary research forward...|$|R
50|$|A gap {{reduction}} {{is a type}} of reduction that, while useful in proving some inapproximability results, does not resemble the other reductions shown here. Gap reductions deal with optimization problems within a decision problem container, generated by changing the problem goal <b>to</b> <b>distinguishing</b> <b>between</b> the optimal solution and solutions some multiplicative factor worse than the optimum.|$|R
5|$|In Vietnam, confiscated pygmy lorises {{are usually}} {{taken to the}} Endangered Primate Rescue Centre in Cúc Phương National Park, to be reintroduced into the wild. Non-experts may find it {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> the pygmy slow loris and the Sunda slow loris, as both have similarly reddish fur, which is variable in colors. In international shipments, pygmy lorises may be even mixed up with pottos or lemurs.|$|E
5|$|In many cases, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging of the spinal cord is performed <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> Guillain–Barré syndrome and other conditions causing limb weakness, such as spinal cord compression. If an MRI scan shows enhancement of the nerve roots, this may be indicative of GBS. In children, this feature is present in 95% of scans, {{but it is not}} specific to Guillain–Barré syndrome, so other confirmation is also needed.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can be {{separated}} from similar species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be confused with P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it relatively easy <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> the two.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2007, Beck {{proposed}} {{a peace conference}} in Afghanistan with the inclusion of [...] "moderate Taliban". The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, thus {{accused him of being}} naïve. He compared the idea of [...] "moderate Taliban" [...] <b>to</b> <b>distinguishing</b> <b>between</b> moderate and radical right-wing extremists in Rhineland-Palatinate. The German public mostly ignored the affair.|$|R

2500|$|William of Ockham (circa 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and theologian, an {{influential}} medieval philosopher and a nominalist. His popular fame {{as a great}} logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Ockham's razor. The term razor refers <b>to</b> <b>distinguishing</b> <b>between</b> two hypotheses either by [...] "shaving away" [...] unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.|$|R
5|$|The {{archaeological site}} and tourist {{attraction}} of Mixco Viejo {{was named after}} being erroneously associated with the Postclassic Poqomam capital referred to in colonial records by that name. The archaeological site has now been identified as Jilotepeque Viejo, {{the capital of the}} Chajoma Kaqchikel kingdom. <b>To</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> the two, the ruins of the Chajoma capital are now referred to as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) while the former Poqomam capital is referred to as Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo).|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{alleged that}} the U.S. military repeatedly conducted indiscriminate attacks, failing <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> combatants and non-combatants. In its most significant finding, the commission also confirmed that South Korean authorities had summarily executed thousands of suspected leftists in South Korea – possibly 100,000 to 200,000 – at {{the outbreak of the}} war, sometimes with U.S. Army officers present and taking photographs.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} phrasing for {{the ranks}} {{uses the word}} cadet as a preface — as an example, cadet corporal. However, custom omits cadet in casual reference. Thus, corporal is the usual wording. Generally, {{where there is a}} need <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> cadets and Canadian Forces members, ranks will be written or spoken as cadet corporal and abbreviated as C/Cpl.|$|E
50|$|The {{promise of}} mote {{technology}} vibration sensors embedded on the railcar itself, {{could also be}} used to measure vibrations and possible wheel impact failures. This type of sensing however would not be able <b>to</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>between</b> the source of the vibrations originating from either the rail track or wheel/bogie. There are many environmental factors that would make mote sensing highly subjective.|$|R
