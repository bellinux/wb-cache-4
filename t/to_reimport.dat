50|$|The {{first major}} {{expansion}} of hydroelectric facilities started in 1975 on the Wang Chhu between Thimphu and Phuntsholing. Known as the Chukha Hydel Project, it helped boost the nation's fledgling industrial development. The 336-megawatt Chukha Hydropower Station came on line in 1986 and was synchronized with the Indian grid that same year, and additional capacity became available in 1988. The Nu2.44 billion Chukha project was 60 percent {{paid for by}} India and budgeted outside the normal development plan process. It was planned that Bhutan would sell at low cost all excess power to West Bengal. At the same cost, Bhutan also hoped <b>to</b> <b>reimport</b> some of that power through the Indian power grid into southern districts. The Chukha project was important {{not only because it}} supplied electric power to western and southern districts but also because it provided a major source of income for the government. In 1981 Bhutan generated 22 million kilowatt-hours of energy from hydroelectric sources. The project's gross annual income was projected at Nu380 million in 1989. Another major plant in southwest Bhutan — the 18,000-kilowatt Jaldhaka hydroelectric plant — furnished electricity locally and exported the balance to India's West Bengal. In 1989 nearly 95 percent of Bhutan's government-installed power generation — a total of 355 megawatts — was supplied by Chukha, and a total of some 20 principal towns and 170 villages had been electrified. By 1990 Thimphu's commercial district had an underground cable system for its power supply.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, public {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the need for affordable prescription drugs. Although Congress has recently enacted a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, many private citizens and state and local governments continue <b>to</b> <b>reimport</b> prescription drugs from Canada {{to take advantage of the}} lower drug prices available in Canada. Many pharmaceutical companies have responded to this phenomenon by cutting off supplies of their drugs to Canadian pharmacies engaging in reituportation. As a result, some state and local governments have initiated litigation alleging state antitrust violations. This Note addresses one of the first questions raised in U. S. antitrust litigation under the Rule of Reason—the definition of the geographic market. First, this Note surveys the current caselaw standard and the academic approaches to geographic market definition. This Note then applies these approaches, concluding that Canada may be included in any geographic market when addressing the legality of reimportation in an antitrust context...|$|E
40|$|For a {{long time}} our {{material}} and energy resources have been exploited for human consumption. It seemed at first like our resources were infinite, until it was proved differently. Since the issue was brought to light efforts have been made, for instance by changing our way of consuming. Additionally our waste management is now established which seeks <b>to</b> <b>reimport</b> material and energy to the cycle to form a more cyclic flow of material and energy. The purpose of this report is to analyze the waste management of the municipality of Stockholm, and the energy and material flow in particular. It will handle the management of recyclable material, food waste and domestic waste but not the hazardous waste, electric waste or bulky waste. The energy and material analysis was made through calculations on energy recovery, material recovery and biogas production. This was made for three different scenarios. Calculating the energy recovery that would be gained if all household waste were put through combustion made the first scenario. The second scenario was a calculation of the material recovery, energy recovery and the energy through biogas production if the amounts of waste and sorting {{were the same as}} today. The last scenario showed what energy recovery, material recovery and biogas production could be made if a maximum sorting was made. A calculation of energy saves from material recovery was also made. Additionally, energy losses from transportations when gathering household waste were calculated based on the transportations today. The results from this investigation showed that the energy from when all household waste was put through combustion was larger than the total energy from biogas and combustion in both the second and third scenario. However, the energy save from material recovery together with the energy from biogas and combustion was larger than when all household waste was put through combustion in both the second and third case. It also showed that the energy losses from the transportations are small in comparison to the energy recovery. This proves that material recovery should always be prioritized and that efforts must be made to improve the collection of household materials. Correspondingly, the waste management in the municipality of Stockholm must be enhanced. It is showed both in customer research and the low amount of gathered recyclable materials and food waste that improvements can be made. The suggestion is to instate curbside collection, preferably bins with four pockets for houses and separate bins for apartment blocks. These systems have proved to lead to both increased amounts of food waste and recyclable material and customer satisfaction.  Under en lång tid har jordens befolkning levt över sina resurser och förbrukat material och energi som att det fanns i all oändlighet. När det uppmärksammats att så inte är fallet har man börjat tänka allt mer på konsumtionen men även hur avfallshanteringen sker. Man har börjat återvinna energi och material ur avfallet för att frångå våra tidigare linjära material- och energiflöden. Rapporten syftar till att utreda hanteringen av hushållsavfallen i Stockholms kommun, där energi och materialflöden granskas särskilt. En utredning av vad enbart förbränning-, dagens sortering- och fullständig källsortering av hushållsavfallet kan ge i form av material och energi gjordes. Även vilka energibesparingar som görs vid framställning av produkt med återvunnet material beräknades. De energiförluster som uppstår vid insamling av hushållsavfallet ingick också i beräkningarna. De faktiska energivinsterna som görs vid enbart förbränning är större än de idag och vid fullständig sortering. Dock är energibesparingen vid återvinning sammantaget med energin som utvinns ur matavfall samt säck-och kärlavfall större än vid enbart förbränning. Det går därmed att säga att det inte bara är materialmässigt försvarbart att återvinna utan även energimässigt. Förutom dessa fördelar minskas även koldioxidutsläppen vid återvinning. Detta visar att återvinning alltid bör prioriteras och att ansträngningar bör göras för att öka den. Slutsatsen av detta var att avfallshanteringen i Stockholms kommun skulle kunna ske på ett enklare sätt, framförallt ur hushållens perspektiv. Detta visas tydligt genom kundundersökningar samt de låga insamlingsmängder av matavfall samt förpackningar och tidningar som uppnåtts i kommunen. För att öka dessa rekommenderas fastighetsnära insamling, lämpligen med fyrfackskärl för villor och separata kärl för lägenheter. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{controls}} {{software in}} use at PEP II (Stanford Control Program - SCP) {{had originally been}} developed in the eighties. It is very successful in routine operation but due to its internal structure it is difficult and time consuming to extend its functionality. This is problematic during machine development and when solving operational issues. Routinely, data has to be exported from the system, analyzed offline, and calculated settings have <b>to</b> be <b>reimported.</b> Since this is a manual process, it is time consuming and error-prone. Setting up automated processes, as is done for MIA (Model Independent Analysis), is also time consuming and specific to each application. Recently, {{there has been a}} trend at light sources to use MATLAB as the platform to control accelerators using a 'MATLAB Middle Layer' (MML), and so called channel access (CA) programs to communicate with the low level control system (LLCS). This has proven very successful, especially during machine development time and trouble shooting. A special CA code, named AIDA (Accelerator Independent Data Access), was developed to handle the communication between MATLAB, modern software frameworks, and the SCP. The MML had to be adapted for implementation at PEP II. Colliders differ significantly in their designs compared to light sources, which poses a challenge. PEP II is the first collider at which this implementation is being done. We will report on this effort, which is still ongoing...|$|R

25|$|Automatic {{synchronization}} can {{be turned}} off in favor of manually copying individual songs or complete playlists. iTunes supports copying music to an iPod; however, only music and videos purchased from the iTunes Store can be transferred from the iPod back to iTunes. This functionality was added after third-party software was written which allowed users to copy all content back to their computer. It is also possible to copy from the iPod using ordinary Unix command line tools, or by enabling hidden file viewing in Windows Explorer, then copying music from the iPod drive to a local disk for backup. Doing this can be confusing because the files are arranged {{in such a way}} that their folders and (depending on iPod and iTunes versions) file names are seemingly picked at random as they are put on the iPod. It is worth noting, however, that the files (along with their embedded title and artist information) remain unchanged. It is therefore less confusing <b>to</b> let iTunes <b>reimport,</b> reorganize, and rename all of the files after they are backed up.|$|R

Here we show that gems are present in a variable but small proportion of rapidly proliferating cells in culture. In the vast majority of cultured cells and in all primary neurons analyzed, SMN and SIP 1 colocalize precisely with snRNPs in the Cajal body. The presence of SMN and SIP 1 in Cajal bodies is confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and by microinjection of antibodies that interfere with the integrity of the structure. The association of SMN with snRNPs and coilin persists during cell division, {{but at the end of}} mitosis there is a lag period between assembly of new Cajal bodies in the nucleus and detection of SMN in these structures, suggesting that SMN is targeted to preformed Cajal bodies. Finally, treatment of cells with leptomycin B (a drug that blocks export of U snRNAs to the cytoplasm and consequently import of new snRNPs into the nucleus) is shown to deplete snRNPs (but not SMN or SIP 1) from the Cajal body. This suggests that snRNPs flow through the Cajal body during their biogenesis pathway...|$|R
