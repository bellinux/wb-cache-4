5|$|The global {{nature of}} the war meant that many {{functions}} that were previously vested in the individual Australian state governments had to be placed {{under the control of}} the Commonwealth government. Additionally, the exigencies of the war meant that the government required the power to enact certain laws that under the Constitution it would not normally be able <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> enable this to occur, the War Precautions Act 1914 was introduced in October 1914, providing the Commonwealth government with wide-ranging powers for a period of up to six months after the duration of the war.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton assumed {{control in}} the War department, and the rift between Adams' and Hamilton's {{supporters}} widened. Many sought to vest Hamilton with command authority over the army, and they also resisted giving prominent Democratic-Republicans positions in the army, which Adams wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> gain bipartisan support. By building a large standing army, Hamilton's supporters raised popular alarms and played {{into the hands of}} the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France. Overall, however, patriotic sentiments and a series of naval victories, popularized the war as well as the president.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian monarch was {{satisfied}} with the results and considered that he had superiority over the Byzantine Empire to achieve his political ambitions— to assume the throne in Constantinople. Despite the success, however, Simeon I {{realized that there was}} still a lot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> prevail over the Empire for good. He needed his own political and ideological base and launched an ambitious construction programme in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In addition, Simeon I took precautions to reduce the Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans by imposing his authority over the Principality of Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{evaporator}} and condenser heat exchangers is also {{very important to the}} overall efficiency of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the heat exchanger, the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.|$|E

The Nazis never reached the South Caucasus, which they intended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> capture the oil fields in Azerbaijan. Still, Armenia played a valuable role in aiding the allies both through industry and agriculture. An estimated 300–500,000 Armenians served in the war, almost half of whom did not return. Armenia thus {{had one of the}} highest death tolls, per capita, among the other Soviet republics.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is a third branch of machine learning, distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, which allows the agent to adapt its behaviour—in other words, to learn what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent, or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions, a quantum speedup may be achieved. Implementations {{of these kinds of}} protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of trapped ions have been proposed.|$|E

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} to {{passive immunity}} is that producing antibodies {{in a laboratory}} is expensive and difficult <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> produce antibodies for infectious diseases, {{there is a need}} for possibly thousands of human donors to donate blood or immune animals' blood would be obtained for the antibodies. Patients who are immunized with the antibodies from animals may develop serum sickness due to the proteins from the immune animal and develop serious allergic reactions. Antibody treatments can be time consuming and are given through an intravenous injection or IV, while a vaccine shot or jab is less time consuming and has less risk of complication than an antibody treatment. Passive immunity is effective, but ephemeral (lasting a short amount of time).|$|E
25|$|The highest {{civilization and}} culture, {{apart from the}} ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found {{exclusively}} among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All {{this is due to}} the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.|$|E

At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean.

Still, Armenia played a valuable role {{in the war in}} providing food, manpower and war matériel. An estimated 300–500,000 Armenians served in the war, almost half of whom did not return. Many attained the highest rank of Hero of the Soviet Union. Over sixty Armenians were promoted to the rank of general, and with an additional four eventually achieving the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union: Ivan Bagramyan (the first non-Slavic commander to hold the position of front commander when he was assigned to be the commander of the First Baltic Front in 1943), Admiral Ivan Isakov, Hamazasp Babadzhanian, and Sergei Khudyakov. The Soviet government, in an effort to shore up popular [...] support for the war, also allowed for token expressions of nationalism with the re-publication of Armenian novels, the production of films such as David Bek (1944), and the easing of restrictions placed against the Church. Stalin temporarily relented his attacks on religion during the war. This led to the election of bishop Gevork in 1945 as new Catholicos Gevork VI. He was subsequently allowed to reside in Echmiatsin.|$|E
500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise {{that was going to be}} a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms."

We explored different ideas, {{and one of them}} was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E
