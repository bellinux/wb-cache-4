5|$|Smith's first {{national}} championship occurred with his 1981–82 team, which {{was composed of}} future NBA players such as Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Sam Perkins. After winning the NCAA Tournament, North Carolina had a record of 32-2. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> that advanced with North Carolina were Georgetown, Houston and Louisville. The Tar Heels actually finished in a tie for first in the ACC regular season with the Ralph Sampson-led Virginia Cavaliers. In the semifinals, North Carolina defeated Houston 68-63 in New Orleans, while Georgetown defeated Louisville 50-46.|$|E
5|$|The final rankings {{were based}} on points {{accumulated}} in matches against <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> in the medal round. Despite the common misconception that the Americans won gold the night they beat the Soviets, this did not occur until February 24 when they defeated Finland 4–2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets finished with silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked the Miracle on Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.|$|E

50|$|If {{a player}} hits {{the ball and}} it lands into <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team’s</b> beer, that player’s side wins the game and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> must chug their beers. This is called a Dunk.|$|R
5|$|The {{game would}} be the first of the 1985–86 season for both teams. Since the return fixture at Hampden Park on 27 March, both teams had played twice, with each playing one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> in the {{qualifying}} group and a friendly. Wales had secured a comfortable home win against Spain in the World Cup qualifying tournament, but had gone down to defeat in Norway. Scotland meanwhile went into the match {{on the back of a}} pair of wins against England and Iceland.|$|E
5|$|The group stage draw {{was held}} on September 10, 2016. Each group would have one team from pool 1, which {{comprised}} the number one seeds from South Korea, China, Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau, and North America; one team from pool 3, which comprised the two international wild cards and the number three seeds from Europe and North America; and two teams from pool 2, which comprised all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the Jamaican {{bobsleigh}} team at the 1988 Winter Olympics was turned into the 1993 movie Cool Runnings. However, the film was only loosely based on actual events, with real life coach Pat Brown later saying that the team had never experienced any of the animosity from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> as depicted in the movie.|$|E
50|$|The {{process would}} be {{repeated}} for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team,</b> using <b>the</b> same answer; the player in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team's</b> booth {{could not hear}} the show's audio when the first team was playing. The team that solved an answer the quickest won a prize.|$|R
50|$|Kill Confirmed: players must collect {{floating}} dog tags {{from the}} corpse of a downed enemy before the kill can be registered. However, the opposing team {{can pick up the}} dog tag as well to deny <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> a kill, which denies <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> a point.|$|R
500|$|Capture the Flag: Players {{compete to}} capture <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team's</b> flag {{and return it}} to their base. Competitive teams must use a great deal of teamplay. Both teams must defend the base from {{incoming}} attackers and get into <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team's</b> base, take their flag and return to base.|$|R
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams.</b> Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
5|$|Australia sent 31 {{athletes in}} 1960, its largest team before the 2006 Winter Olympics; their size was boosted by an outclassed 18-man ice hockey team, which conceded 83 goals in losing all six matches. They lost to Czechoslovakia 181 and the United States 121 in their two group matches, and were then placed {{into a group}} with Finland and Japan, the last-placed teams in the two other {{preliminary}} groups. The Australians played two matches against each of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> to determine the three worst teams in the nine-country contest. They lost all four matches, conceding a total of 53 goals. The heaviest margins were in the defeats to Czechoslovakia and Finland, 181 and 192 respectively. Australia scored only 10 goals in reply.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> were in place by the end of October.|$|E
25|$|If {{one team}} kicks <b>the</b> ball; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> has <b>the</b> right {{to recover the}} ball and attempt a return.

5000|$|In the Czech Republic, {{the game}} is known as [...] "král vysílá své vojsko" [...] (the king sends out all his army), with the {{difference}} that each team chooses which of its members will attempt to break <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team's</b> line, rather than sending the member called by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team.</b>|$|R
500|$|Any goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an {{attacker}} {{in position}} to score can be charged with a penalty shot for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team.</b> <b>The</b> goalkeeper can also be temporarily ejected from the game for twenty seconds if they prevent a likely goal (for example, by splashing). If the goalkeeper pushes the ball under {{the water in the}} [...] area, instead of being a free throw to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team,</b> it is a penalty. A penalty is also awarded to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> if <b>the</b> goalkeeper pulls down from the crossbar of the goal to prevent a goal.|$|R
5|$|By 1895 {{the only}} backs {{remaining}} from the 1893 Championship-winning team were Bancroft and Gould. Gould was now partnered with Owen Badger, who kept his {{place for the}} whole campaign. As <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> adopted the Welsh style of play, Wales lost their advantage; the livelier English forwards outplayed their Welsh counterparts to give England victory in the opening game of the 1895 Championship. This {{was followed by a}} close loss to Scotland at Raeburn Place and then a narrow win over Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the {{war effort}} had a devastating effect on many rosters. The Red Wings lost nine players and the Maple Leafs lost six to the military. The Rangers lost ten players {{and had to be}} persuaded by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> not to suspend operations. In contrast, the Canadiens lost only one key player in Ken Reardon. Young phenom Maurice Richard tried to enlist, but was turned down due to his medical history. Canadiens General Manager Tommy Gorman {{reportedly}} ensured his players obtained jobs in key wartime industries to avoid conscription.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 2013, {{a team of}} Russian {{scientists}} {{released a}} report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning—a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope polonium. Vladimir Uiba, {{the head of the}} Federal Medical and Biological Agency, said that Arafat died of natural causes (without explaining which) and the agency had no plans to conduct further tests. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> support their conclusions of a probable death by polonium poisoning. In March 2015 a French prosecutor announced that his death was of natural causes, and the polonium and lead traces found were environmental.|$|E

A penalty is also awarded to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> if <b>the</b> goalkeeper pulls down from the crossbar of the goal to prevent a goal.|$|R
50|$|If the {{one team}} hits {{the ball and}} it hits <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team’s</b> defense in <b>the</b> air, that will be {{considered}} a hit if it would have hit the cup were the defense not there. However, {{this is a difficult}} thing to ascertain. Ultimately, the team that shot the ball gets to make the decision of whether the shot is a Hit or not. However, the arguments of the bystanders and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> should be listened to and respected. For this reason, playing defense can sometimes increase the risk both of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>team</b> calling a hit and the ensuing arguments.|$|R
5|$|The 2009 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:47p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. An {{estimated}} total of 73,602tickets were sold for the game, but bowl officials estimated 15,781sold tickets went unused, giving a turnstile attendance of 57,821. The game was televised on FOX, and the announcers were Thom Brennaman, Charles Davis, and Chris Myers. An estimated 9.3million viewers watched the broadcast, earning it a Nielsen rating of 5.4. Figures {{on the total}} payout vary, but Virginia Tech and Cincinnati each received between $17million and $18million for playing in the Orange Bowl, an amount that was shared with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> in each school's athletic conference.|$|E
5|$|The 2016 season saw {{a return}} to the playoffs for the Crusaders, who posted a record of 11 wins and 4 losses, Despite the Crusaders having a good record they still {{finished}} 6th in the last spot of the Australasian Group. This occurred because the Hurricanes, Highlanders and Chiefs all posted a record of 11 wins and 4 losses. However, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> earned more points than the Crusaders (50) so finished higher Hurricanes (53), Highlanders (52) and Chiefs (51). The Crusaders had to travel to Johannesburg to face the Lions. The Crusaders were well beaten by the (Runners-up) Lions 42-25 in the qualifier round.|$|E
5|$|The American Federation of Netball Associations (AFNA) hosts two tournaments each year: the Caribbean Netball Association (CNA) Under 16 Championship and the AFNA Senior Championship. The CNA {{championship}} involves {{two divisions}} of {{teams from the}} Caribbean islands. In 2010 five teams competed in two rounds of round robin matches in the Championship Division, while four teams competed in the Developmental Division. Jamaica, which has lost only once in the tournament, decided not to play the 2011 tournament. The AFNA Senior Championship includes Canada and the USA along with the Caribbean nations. The tournament serves as a qualifier for the World Championship. Jamaica, with its high ranking, {{does not have to}} qualify; this leaves two spots to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> in the tournament.|$|E

5|$|The American High School League in Europe (also {{referred}} to as High School Football Europe) is a competition organised by the European branch of the Department of Defense Dependents Schools. The teams in this league are drawn from high schools affiliated with US military bases within Europe, {{with the exception of}} South Gloucestershire and Stroud College which is a further education college located in Filton, England. The league in its present format was founded in 1975, with its constituent teams divided into three divisions. All teams play a regular season schedule against <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> in their regional conference, with the top-ranked teams competing in playoffs to decide the divisional champions. As of 2017, only one team based in the United Kingdom competes in the league, compared to the five teams that competed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The NBA Finals {{has always}} {{employed}} a best-of-seven series format. The Conference (or Division) Finals {{have used this}} format since 1958; the Conference (or Division) Semifinals since 1968; and the First Round since 2003. During the 1947 and 1948 playoffs, in which teams from different divisions met {{each other in the}} opening rounds, the first-place teams from each division played a best-of-seven series against each other before one advanced to the league finals. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams</b> in the playoffs competed against each other in three best-of-three series to determine the other spot in the finals.|$|E
5|$|The NSWRL were {{reluctant}} to admit a ninth team into the premiership and proposed they merge with nearby team Western Suburbs. However, the clubs involved declined so the NSWRL agreed to allowing the Cumberland team to a trial match against Eastern Suburbs. While Eastern Suburbs won the match 18–4, the NSWRL was convinced of {{that they could be}} competitive. As the NSWRL premiership had already begun, the NSWRL had to reformat the draw to include Cumberland, which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine. Cumberland did not have a home ground, like some of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>teams,</b> and would play their games at the Agricultural Ground, Birchgrove Oval and Wentworth Park.|$|E
