25|$|There is a vida of Jordan which {{exists in}} several manuscripts, some with an {{accompanying}} razo. Like typical vidas, it <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> {{he was from}} and whom he loved. He was from Pena d'Albeges (modern Penne). At some point he had {{a love affair with}} Elis (Lucia) de Montfort, wife of Guillem de Gordon (c. 1165) and then Bernart de Casnac (c. 1214). This affair was originally in a vida of Bertran de Born, but it was cut out and placed in Jordan's own vida-razo at a later date.|$|E
2500|$|Also on March 10, Cramer {{appeared}} on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Commentator Joe Scarborough {{weighed in on}} the feud, criticizing Stewart and The Daily Show for being unfair to those ideologically opposed to Stewart: [...] "I {{would like to see}} Jon Stewart come out and tell us what he believes in. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> America needs to go in the future. And let us take a microphone around and a camera around with him 24 hours a day {{for a couple of months}} and then we can edit out all the mistakes he makes. It's very easy to shoot at the arena." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'You {{may as well}} {{face the}} matter,' said I; 'you have {{been caught in the}} act, and no {{confession}} could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.' ...|$|R

[...] "She begins by <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> she started, like she lays in bed and wonders where she left herself. A lot of people go through that sort of thing. It's kind of about empowerment." ...|$|R

5000|$|For {{example in}} the domain of automobiles, we might need a made-in type {{relationship}} which <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> each car is built. So the Ford Explorer is made-in Louisville. The ontology may also know that Louisville is-located-in Kentucky and Kentucky is-classified-as-a state and is-a-part-of the U.S.. Software using this ontology could now answer a question like [...] "which cars are made in the U.S.?" ...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} fill a gap in the law: the {{conspicuous}} absence among commonly accepted civil and political human rights theories of any particular right that <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> the other rights ought to exist â€“ not the jurisdictions in which they apply, but what the physical world those other rights occupy ought to look like. In other words, what sort of environment do humans have a right to...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons to look back in time such as trying {{to learn from the}} past or to avoid repeating it. History also <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> we have come from and how this has shaped the current {{environment}} in which we live, socialise and work. Renal health care has also been shaped by the past, and insights from the past can help us to face the challenges of the present, and in turn to see how the future might be...|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} Rheged is disputed: {{none of the}} early sources <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> Rheged was located.

Others say that it may have included large parts of Dumfriesshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire.

6000|$|... "Ah! John, John, {{though this}} may sound like reason to rebellious ears, to mine it seemeth only as the ravings of insanity.

30|$|The subband or {{transform}} audio coding schemes primarily {{exploit the}} destination (human ear) model; the psychoacoustic model <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>where</b> signal distortions (quantization) are allowed such {{that these are}} inaudible or least annoying. In speech coding, on the other hand, source models are primarily used. The incoming signal is matched to {{the characteristics of a}} source model (the vocal tract model), and the parameters of this source model are transmitted. In the decoder, the source model and its parameters are used to reconstruct the signal. For an overview on speech coding, please refer to [21].|$|R

We want land, when we are old enough to turn our hands to labor, and I make my pitch out here in the woods, say where no man has pitched afore me. Now in my {{judgment}} that makes the best of title, the Lord's title."[17] ...|$|R

5000|$|An {{admirer of}} Christie, Milward Kennedy of The Guardian began {{his review of}} 30 July 1935, [...] "Very few authors achieve the ideal blend of puzzle and {{entertainment}} as often does Agatha Christie." [...] He did admit that, [...] "Death in the Clouds may not rank with her greatest achievements, but it is far above the average detective story."
