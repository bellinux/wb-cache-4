5|$|For the 1983 {{election}} Benn's Bristol South East constituency was abolished by boundary changes, {{and he lost}} to Michael Cocks in {{the selection}} of a candidate <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new winnable seat of Bristol South. Rejecting offers from the new seat of Livingston in Scotland, Benn contested Bristol East, losing to the Conservative's Jonathan Sayeed in June 1983.|$|E
5|$|However, on 3 May 2013, Rajoelina made last-minute {{arrangements}} <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2013 presidential elections, {{declaring the}} roadmap agreement had been breached when former president Ravalomanana's wife, Lalao, decided to stand. The candidacy {{of former president}} Didier Ratsiraka was also permitted; the candidature of all three prominent politicians {{was rejected by the}} international community. At the time that Rajoelina submitted his candidacy, he would have run against forty other candidates in total, of whom seven were affiliated with his own political movement.|$|E
5|$|The reform {{legislation}} for the Legislative Council {{was not to}} take effect until the next election, {{and the death of}} LCL MLC Harold Kemp necessitated a by-election for the council district of Southern on 11 August. Southern was an ultra-safe rural LCL seat, and Labor declined <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> by-election. It was contested by the LCL, the LM, a separate Country Party and the Australia Party. The three non-LCL parties agreed on favourable preference deals in the hope of one of them displacing the LCL. The LM gained 29 per cent of the vote, and the LCL candidate won by a 4 per cent margin once preferences had been distributed.|$|E

5|$|The tournaments {{were not}} without controversy. Players complained about Microsoft's {{tardiness}} in posting the official {{rules for the}} first playoff, and {{it was believed that}} the top posted score was not achievable by fair means. Officials, however, stated that the score was possible, and allowed the results <b>to</b> <b>stand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second playoff, Microsoft initially named the runner up as the North American finalist, after disqualifying the winner for no publicly stated reason, but eventually had to send the second runner up to Tokyo when the first was unable to produce a passport in time.|$|E
5|$|While SUPP's {{candidate}} was confirmed {{only a few}} days after Hoi Chew's death, the DAP delayed announcing its candidate until 27 April. SUPP alleged the delay was due to a split in the DAP; however, the DAP insisted the delay was a calculated political strategy. On 27 April, the Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat announced Wong Ho Leng, state chairman of the DAP and State Assemblyman for Bukit Assek, as its candidate. Wong had earlier indicated his reluctance <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> by-election, suggesting that the party consider the opportunity to field a younger candidate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain {{about their ability to}} withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E

5|$|Defoe {{was finally}} imprisoned on 21 May 1703, after {{avoiding}} his summons and evading capture. He was fined, made <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pillory on three occasions and remained in prison till November; in the meantime, his business affairs sank into ruin. The whole affair left {{a lasting impression}} on him, which can be felt in his writings. In the years following his arrest and release, Defoe made several attempts to explain The Shortest Way and his own viewpoint. Amongst the series of explanatory pamphlets doing this are An Explanation of a Late Pamphlet, Entituled, The Shortest Way… (1703) and A Dialogue Between a Dissenter and the Observator (1703). The suspected involvement of the Tory Speaker of the House, Robert Harley, in obtaining the release of Defoe is credited {{as the beginning of}} their professional relationship, in which Defoe worked as a propagandist for Harley, after he succeeded Nottingham as Secretary of State in 1704.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} phases of registration, 150 parties were {{registered}} with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission. This reduction from the 48 parties that stood in the 1999 legislative election was largely attributed to new an election law that allowed only parties that had won two percent of seats in the DPR, or three percent of seats in provincial and regental legislatures in half of the provinces <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 election. Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} as Mother Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, who has been {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pillory.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{rising to}} power, Rajoelina {{dissolved}} the Senate and National Assembly and transferred their powers {{to a variety}} of new governance structures he made responsible for overseeing the transition toward a new constitutional authority. These administrative structures repeatedly conflicted with the internationally mediated process to establish a transitional government of consensus. Voters approved a new constitution in a national referendum unilaterally organized by the Rajoelina administration in November 2010, ushering in the Fourth Republic and putting in place the conditions enabling Rajoelina <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next general election. In January 2013 he announced his decision to abstain from running in the 2013 general election, but in May 2013 he reversed this decision and submitted his candidature. A special electoral court ruled in August 2013 that his candidature was invalid and that Rajoelina would not be permitted to run in the 2013 election. He has declared an interest in presenting himself as a presidential candidate in a future election.|$|E
