The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for the fact <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates {{of the society}} of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to do much more than most now do.|$|E

500|$|Thure Lindhardt, a {{frequent}} collaborator in Madsen's films with {{an ability to}} [...] "slip himself into any part", according to the director, was cast. Mads Mikkelsen was chosen by the director before his international career was launched because, as Madsen said, [...] "he has this grand masculinity, and he approaches his roles like an animal". Both Lindhardt and Mikkelsen were cast early in the project, in about 2005, and Stengade was cast even earlier—in 2001. The casting process [...] "wasn't really difficult, because I didn't feel <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> could play these parts", Madsen stated.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of the fourth season, Beaver joined the limited series Harper's Island. Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I can get out of the chair {{at the end of the}} day and go home and I recognize <b>that,</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> can't and I have to be considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E

An additional surprise came after a decade-long series of American-based kulintang students traveled to Mindanao to perform, sparking a kulintang renaissance in the Philippines. The groundwork for this Renaissance originated as early as 1978 through the work {{of one of the}} early cultural pioneers and activists amongst Filipino Americans, Robert Kikuchi-Yngojo. It was his dedication in the early 80's that created the cultural awareness in the Fil-Am community of San Franccisco that sparked a cultural movement. The knowledge of outsiders playing traditional kulintang has encouraged the younger generation of musicians in the Philippines, both in Mindanao and in Taguig, Metro Manila. Enthusiastic appreciation by foreigners has given life to a dying tradition, and the music has become a unifying force in the Philippine diaspora. [...] For the first time in history, kulintang music is now formally taught to music students at several universities located throughout Metro Manila.|$|E

500|$|Observers, {{including}} series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, {{said that}} illegal downloads did not hurt the series' prospects; it benefited from [...] "buzz" [...] and social commentary, {{and the high}} piracy rate did not significantly translate to lost subscriptions. According to Polygon, HBO's relaxed attitude towards piracy and the sharing of login credentials amounted to a premium-television [...] "free-to-play" [...] model. At a 2015 Oxford Union debate, series co-creator David Benioff {{said that he was}} just glad that people watched the show; illegally downloaded copies of the show sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy of the show, especially in countries where the show was not televised.

Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife.

500|$|The burning {{aeroplane}} in the book's opening, and the suspicions {{it immediately}} arouses, quickly introduces {{the problems of}} terrorism and international security. The day's political demonstration and the ubiquity of its news coverage provide background noise to Perowne's day, leading to him to ponder his relationship with these events. Christopher Hitchens {{pointed out that the}} novel is set on the [...] "actual day the whole of bien-pensant Britain moved into the streets to jeer at George Bush and Tony Blair" [...] and placed the novel as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in the}} material world and its several discontents". The Economist newspaper set the context as a [...] "world where terrorism and war make headlines, but also filter into the smallest corners of people's lives." [...] McEwan said himself, [...] "The march gathered not far from my house, and it bothered me <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> seemed so thrilled to be there". The characterisation of Perowne as an intelligent, self-aware man: [...] "..a habitual observer of his own moods' [...] is given to reveries about his mental processes," [...] allows the author to explicitly set out this theme.|$|E

Because of their reserved personalities, Robert Christgau believed they relied on a low-key, vulnerable style and [...] "traded ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers, and friends". According to NME magazine's Emily Mackay, all of the songs dealt with the consuming emotions associated with first love, including the tacit intimacy on [...] "VCR", the yearning expressed on [...] "Heart Skipped a Beat", and the premature affection warned of on [...] "Crystalised". Petra Davis from The Quietus argued that the thematic crux of xx was in the succession of songs from [...] "Islands" [...] to [...] "Shelter", each of which saw [...] "a radical shift in perspective on a similar—perhaps a single—love story." ...|$|E
