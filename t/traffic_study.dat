5|$|Before {{completion}} of the tunnel, in 2009, nearly 16,000 vehicles travelled to and from PortMiami through downtown streets each weekday. Truck traffic made up 28% (or 4,480) of this number (Source: 2009 PB Americas <b>Traffic</b> <b>Study).</b> In 2010 {{it was estimated that}} around 19,000 vehicles traveled to the port daily but that only 16% were trucks. Existing truck and bus routes restricted the port's ability to grow, drive up costs for port users and presenting safety hazards. They were also thought to congest and limit redevelopment of the northern portion of Miami's Central Business District.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a <b>traffic</b> <b>study,</b> as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{transferred}} {{maintenance of}} Queens Chapel Road from MD 410 to US 1 {{to the town}} of University Park in August 1988 ahead of the construction of the Washington Metro's Green Line underneath the town; the town subsequently closed the road through town. A 1991 <b>traffic</b> <b>study</b> showed the majority of traffic along the University Park segment of Queens Chapel Road was through traffic before it was closed, and recommended the highway be closed {{at the southern end of}} town and only allow traffic to exit the town onto US 1. After Metro construction was completed in the summer of 1992, the University Park Town Council elected to keep the road closed to through traffic; this measure was affirmed by a town referendum in January 1993. Today, there is a cul-de-sac at the southwest end of town adjacent to the MD 500MD 410 intersection; the intersection with US 1 at the northeast end of town only allows traffic to exit Queens Chapel Road.|$|E

500|$|The Fort Lee lane closure scandal was a U.S. {{political}} {{scandal that}} concerns New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's staff and his Port Authority political appointees conspiring {{to create a}} traffic jam in Fort Lee, New Jersey as political retribution, and their attempts to cover up these actions and suppress internal and public disclosures. Dedicated toll lanes {{for one of the}} Fort Lee entrances (used by local traffic from Fort Lee and surrounding communities) to the upper level on the George Washington Bridge, which connects to Manhattan, were reduced from three to one from September 9–13, 2013. The toll lane closures caused massive Fort Lee traffic back-ups, which affected public safety due to extensive delays by police and emergency service providers and disrupted schools due to the delayed arrivals of students and teachers. Two Port Authority officials (who were appointed by Christie and would later resign) claimed that reallocating two of the toll lanes from the local Fort Lee entrance to the major highways was due to a <b>traffic</b> <b>study</b> evaluating [...] "traffic safety patterns" [...] at the bridge, but the Executive Director of the Port Authority was unaware of a <b>traffic</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E

It said that the closures had been ordered by Wildstein on September 6, 2013, despite various PA engineers expressing their concerns, particularly about more traffic congestion on local streets and no advance notice to Fort Lee officials. Wildstein, the letter said, had ordered bridge officials not to notify Foye of the closures. It also revealed that the PA's board had not approved Baroni's November 25 presentation before that committee, that the closures {{were part of a}} <b>traffic</b> <b>study.</b> It showed that PA's procedures for planning and internal notifications for any <b>traffic</b> <b>study</b> were not followed. However, the letter did not reveal any reason why the closures were ordered. It characterized the incident as [...] "aberrational".
