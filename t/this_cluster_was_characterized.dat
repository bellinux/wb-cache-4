The farm households earn most of their income from rice crop, vegetables and from off-farm sources. These are typical subsistence farms that have started to shift from traditional farming to non-farming vocations, often {{in the form of}} seasonal migration. Maintaining food security is a key policy goal for these farms, which may be achieved through sustainable and risk-averting cultivation of food grains (e.g. climate resilient agriculture) coupled with assured coverage under public distribution system for food grains (Thomas [2006]). This might be supplemented with a comprehensive capacity building programme on non-farm enterprises, since these people are poor in human resources and exploited in the labor markets in nearer towns (Deb et al. [2002]). Collectivization of small enterprises may follow this capacity building programme for their market integration.|$|R

30|$|Cluster II {{comprised}} of 35.21 % {{of the farm}} households. The cluster members had relatively smaller land, smaller family size, relatively poor family education, and high crop diversification (Col 2, Table  8). These farms lease-in land and their fragmented lands are relatively nearer to their settlement. <b>This</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> by low system gross return, low cost of cultivation, moderate system net return, but relatively better cost-benefit ratio. These households secured large proportion of income from vegetables, fishery, livestock and rice crop and may be grouped as diversified farms. These farms are management intensive, presumably supported by human labor, and pursue diversification in enterprises. Integrated farming with livestock and fishery will help in higher food and livelihood security without undermining farm resources (Prein [2002]). This will require specialized extension support with a farming system approach, and institutional convergence for sound planning (Nabi [2008]). Cash crops may be promoted for enhancing farm income with assured provision for credit and insurance (Fafchamps [1992]). On account of the large proportion of such farms, collectivization might be a viable strategy for their market integration (Hazell [2005]).|$|R
40|$|Activated {{leukocyte}} {{cell adhesion}} molecule (ALCAM/CD 166) is a progression marker {{of a variety of}} cancers, including melanoma, and is a marker for mesenchymal stem cells. ALCAM expression triggers matrix metalloproteinase activity and correlates with the transition between superficial melanoma growth and deep dermal invasion in vivo. We previously showed that manipulating ALCAM functionality could both decrease and increase melanoma invasion, depending on the manner by which ALCAM function was altered. How ALCAM exerts these opposing invasive phenotypes remained elusive. In the present study, we analyzed differences in melanoma cell gene expression in two- and three-dimensional cultures as function of ALCAM-mediated adhesion. We identified a cluster of genes highly responsive to ALCAM functionality and relevant for melanoma invasion. <b>This</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> by known invasion-related genes similar to L 1 neuronal {{cell adhesion molecule}} and showed a remarkable induction of several innate immune genes. Unexpectedly, we identified major variations in the expression of genes related to an immunological response when modulating ALCAM function, including complement factors C 1 r and C 1 s. The expression and function of these proteinases were confirmed in protein assays and in vivo. Together, our results demonstrate a link between ALCAM functionality and the immune transcriptome, and support the assumption that ALCAM-ALCAM interactions could function as a cell signaling complex to promote melanoma tumor invasion...|$|R
30|$|Cluster I {{accounts}} for 5.63 % of farm households. The <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> comprised of households having large land holding, large family size (representing joint extended families), relatively higher family education, and relatively higher crop diversification (Col. 1, Table  8). The households both lease out and lease in land, land are highly fragmented and situated {{at a high}} distance from the dwellings. In terms of economic performance indicators, <b>this</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> by relatively high system gross return, higher cost of cultivation and system net return and relatively higher cost-benefit ratio. These households, on an average, secured high income from rice crop, poultry and vegetables followed by fruits and fishery. They depended wholly on agriculture with no off-farm income. These farms may be supported for technically sound intensification of agriculture with assured input and advisory services. Since these groups pursue a capital intensive diversified farming, access to credit is important for them. The farmers may be assisted in commercial production techniques with provision for building requisite capacity in farm and non-farm based entrepreneurship (Folmer et al. [2010]). Export-oriented crops may be tried with these farmers with suitable incentive (Singh [2002]). Since these farms are capital and management intensive, they are prone to become environmentally unsustainable in the long run. An environmental monitoring mechanism is needed {{to be in place}} in addition to an incentivized system in favour of sustainable farming (Dhiman and Thambi [2009]).|$|R

Aims: To understand the nature and thermodynamic evolution of the LSB cluster by studying the physical properties of the hot intracluster medium in A 76. Methods: We conducted two-pointed Suzaku observations of A 76 and examined the global gas properties of the cluster by XIS spectral analysis. We also performed deprojection analysis of annular spectra and derived radial profiles of gas temperature, density and entropy out to approximately 850 kpc (~ 0. 6 r_ 200) and 560 kpc (~ 0. 4 r_ 200) in A 76 East and A 76 West, respectively. Results: The measured global temperature and metal abundance are approximately 3. 3 keV and 0. 24 solar, respectively. From the deprojection analysis, the entropy profile is found to be flat with respect to radius. The entropy within the central region (r < 0. 2 r_ 200) is exceptionally high (~ 400 keV cm^ 2). This phenomenon is not readily explained by either gravitational heating or preheating. The X-ray morphology is clumped and irregular, and the electron density is extremely low (1 e- 4 [...] 1 e- 3 cm^- 3) for the observed high temperature, suggesting that A 76 is in the early phase of cluster formation and the gas compression due to gravitational potential confinement is lagging behind the gas heating.

JD patients were monitored every 3 months for levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and clinical and microbial parameters were measured 6 weeks before drawing blood for levels of HbA 1 c (M% = 8. 76). Clinical indices, measured for the entire permanent dentition, included: probing depth (PD), attachment level (AL), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), and plaque index (PI). Subgingival plaque samples were obtained at 2 sites from each subject; whenever possible, the site with the deepest probing depth and the mesial aspect of the maxillary right first molar were used. Microbial analyses were determined by cultural characteristics and biochemical tests. No significant differences were detected in any of the clinical indices for the entire dentition. The mean AL for JD sites was 2. 32 +/- 0. 83 mm and for HS sites was 2. 2 +/- 0. 85 mm. Mean percentage of total cultivable anaerobic microflora included Capnocytophaga spp. (JD, 13. 21 %; HS, 11 %) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (JD, 5. 1 %; HS, 7. 9 %).

This tolerance correlated with heritable increase in metal excretion efficiency, less pronounced cadmium (Cd) -induced growth reduction and overexpression of the metallothionein gene. We applied transcriptomics to determine differential gene expression caused by this abiotic stress in reference and Cd-tolerant populations. Many cDNAs responded to Cd exposure in the reference population. Significantly fewer clones were Cd responsive in tolerant animals. Analysis of variance revealed transcripts that interact between Cd exposure and population. Hierarchical cluster analysis of these clones identified two major groups.

Although the pattern of expression of the adjacent normal growth hormone (hGH-N) and chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) genes in <b>this</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>are</b> well <b>characterized,</b> the expression of the hGH-V gene remains to be defined.

In the present report, we document the expression of both of these hGH-V mRNA species in the villi of the term placenta, demonstrate an increase in their concentrations during gestation, and directly sublocalize hGH-V gene expression to the syncytiotrophoblastic epithelium of the term placenta by in situ cDNA-mRNA histohybridization.

40|$|Fuzzy {{sets and}} rough sets {{have been widely}} used in many {{clustering}} algorithms for medical image segmentation, and have recently been combined together to better deal with the uncertainty implied in observed image data. Despite of their wide spread applications, traditional hybrid approaches are sensitive to the empirical weighting parameters and random initialization, and hence may produce less accurate results. In this paper, a novel hybrid clustering approach, namely the generalized rough fuzzy c-means (GRFCM) algorithm is proposed for brain MR image segmentation. In <b>this</b> algorithm, each <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> by three automatically determined rough-fuzzy regions, and accordingly the membership of each pixel is estimated with respect to the region it locates. The importance of each region is balanced by a weighting parameter, and the bias field in MR images is modeled by a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials. The weighting parameter estimation and bias field correction have been incorporated into the iterative clustering process. Our algorithm has been compared to the existing rough c-means and hybrid clustering algorithms in both synthetic and clinical brain MR images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more robust to the initialization, noise, and bias field, and can produce more accurate and reliable segmentations.

40|$|International audienceImportant {{aspects of}} the {{seasonal}} variations of surface ozone are discussed. The underlying analysis {{is based on the}} long-term (1990 ? 2004) ozone records of Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) and the World Data Center of Greenhouse Gases which do have a strong Northern Hemisphere bias. Seasonal variations are pronounced at most of the 114 locations for any time of the day. Seasonal-diurnal variability classification using hierarchical agglomeration clustering reveals 5 distinct clusters: clean/rural, semi-polluted non-elevated, semi-polluted semi-elevated, elevated and polar/remote marine types. For the cluster "clean/rural" the seasonal maximum is observed in April, both for night and day. For those sites with a double maximum or a wide spring-summer maximum, the one in spring appears both for day and night, while the one in summer is more pronounced for daytime and hence can be attributed to photochemical processes. For the spring maximum photochemistry is a less plausible explanation as no dependence of the maximum timing is observed. More probably the spring maximum is caused by dynamical/transport processes. Using data from the 3 -D atmospheric chemistry general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1 covering the period of 1998 ? 2005 a comparison has been performed for the identified clusters. For the model data four distinct classes of variability are detected. The majority of cases are covered by the regimes with a spring seasonal maximum or with a broad spring-summer maximum (with prevailing summer). The regime with winter?early spring maximum is reproduced by the model for southern hemispheric locations. Background and semi-polluted sites appear in the model in the same cluster. The seasonality in <b>this</b> model <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> by a pronounced spring (May) maximum. For the model cluster that covers partly semi-elevated semi-polluted sites the role of the photochemical production/destruction seems to be overestimated. Taking into consideration the differences in the data sampling procedure the carried out comparison demonstrates the ability of the model to reproduce the main regimes of surface ozone variability quite well...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} pair of 3 -d magnetohydrodynamical {{simulations}} of intermittent jets from a central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy cluster extracted from a high resolution cosmological simulation. The selected <b>cluster</b> <b>was</b> chosen as an apparently relatively relaxed system, not having undergone a major merger in almost 7 Gyr. Despite this characterization and history, the intra-cluster medium (ICM) contains quite active "weather". We explore {{the effects of this}} ICM weather on the morphological evolution of the AGN jets and lobes. The orientation of the jets is different in the two simulations so that they probe different aspects of the ICM structure and dynamics. We find that even for <b>this</b> <b>cluster</b> that can <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> as relaxed by an observational standard, the large-scale, bulk ICM motions can significantly distort the jets and lobes. Synthetic X-ray observations of the simulations show that the jets produce complex cavity systems, while synthetic radio observations reveal bending of the jets and lobes similar to wide-angle tail (WAT) radio sources. The jets are cycled on and off with a 26 Myr period using a 50 % duty cycle. This leads to morphological features similar to those in "double-double" radio galaxies.

40|$|Abstract Background The rate of pubertal {{development}} and weaning to estrus interval are correlated and affect reproductive efficiency of swine. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for age of puberty, nipple number and ovulation rate {{have been identified}} in Meishan crosses on pig chromosome 10 q (SSC 10) near the telomere, which is homologous to human chromosome 10 p 15 and contains an aldo-keto reductase (AKR) gene cluster with at least six family members. AKRs are tissue-specific hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases that interconvert weak steroid hormones to their more potent counterparts and regulate processes involved in development, homeostasis and reproduction. Because of their location in the swine genome and their implication in reproductive physiology, <b>this</b> gene <b>cluster</b> <b>was</b> <b>characterized</b> and evaluated for effects on reproductive traits in swine. Results Screening the porcine CHORI- 242 BAC library with a full-length AKR 1 C 4 cDNA identified 7 positive clones and sample sequencing of 5 BAC clones revealed 5 distinct AKR 1 C genes (AKR 1 CL 2 and AKR 1 C 1 through 4), which mapped to 126 – 128 cM on SSC 10. Using the IMpRH 7000 rad and IMNpRH 2 12000 rad radiation hybrid panels, these 5 genes mapped between microsatellite markers SWR 67 and SW 2067. Comparison of sequence data with the porcine BAC fingerprint map show that the cluster of genes resides in a 300 kb region. Twelve SNPs were genotyped in gilts observed for age at first estrus and ovulation rate from the F 8 and F 10 generations of one-quarter Meishan descendants of the USMARC resource population. Age at puberty, nipple number and ovulation rate data were analyzed for association with genotypes by MTDFREML using an animal model. One SNP, a phenylalanine to isoleucine substitution in AKR 1 C 2, was associated with age of puberty (p = 0. 07) and possibly ovulation rate (p = 0. 102). Two SNP in AKR 1 C 4 were significantly associated with nipple number (p ≤ 0. 03) and another possibly associated with age at puberty (p = 0. 09). Conclusion AKR 1 C genotypes were associated with nipple number as well as possible effects on age at puberty and ovulation rate. The estimated effects of AKR 1 C genotypes on these traits suggest that the SNPs are in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutations that affect reproductive traits in swine. Further investigations are necessary to identify these mutations and understand how these AKR 1 C genes affect these important reproductive traits. The nucleotide sequence data reported have been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers [GenBank: DQ 474064 – DQ 474068, GenBank: DQ 494488 – DQ 494490 and GenBank: DQ 487182 – DQ 487184]. </p...|$|R

We use this new photometric dataset to reevaluate the properties (age and distance) of IC 4665. Namely, using a statistical approach incorporating Tau^ 2 CMD modeling, we measure a pre-main-sequence isochrone age and distance of 36 +- 9 Myr and 360 +- 12 pc, {{as well as a}} upper-main-sequence turn-off age and distance of 42 +- 12 Myr and 357 +- 12 pc. These ages and distances are highly dependent on the isochrone model and color used for the fitting procedure, with a possible range of ~ 10 - 20 Myr in age and ~ 20 pc in distance. This spread in calculated ages and distances seen between colors and models is likely due to limitations in the individual membership catalogs and/or systematic differences in the predicted stellar parameters from the different sets of models. Interestingly, when we compare the isochrone ages for IC 4665 to the published lithium depletion boundary age, 28 +- 5 Myr, we observe that <b>this</b> <b>cluster</b> does not appear to follow the trend of isochrone ages being 1. 5 times smaller than lithium depletion boundary ages. In addition, comparing the overall magnetic activity (X-ray and H-alpha emission) in IC 4665 with other well studied open clusters, we find the observed activity distributions for <b>this</b> young <b>cluster</b> <b>are</b> best <b>characterized</b> by assuming an age of 30 - 40 Myr, thus in agreement with our pre-main-sequence and turn-off isochrone ages for IC 4665.
