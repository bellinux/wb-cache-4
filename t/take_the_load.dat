This amplifier was installed on the interior side of the cars' firewall, and had a duct which provided outside air to cool the unit. The rest of the system (distributor and spark plugs) remains as for the mechanical system. The lack of moving parts compared with the mechanical system leads to greater reliability and longer service intervals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Strain rate {{is a vital}} {{factor for}} the design of a RC (Reinforced Concrete) member under blast loading. At pre-sent, it is not {{scientific}} and cut down the believability to assume the strain rate is a constant or to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> rate in-stead of the strain rate. In this paper, an analytical model of RC beams with flexible supports is presented, in which the elasticity, damping, and lumped mass of flexible support are taken into account. Theoretical method of strain rate for RC beam with flexible supports under blast loading is developed based on Euler-Bernoulli beams. It is indicated that the maximal values of strain rate are increased as the blast impulses and the overpressures increased, but <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> rates have not obvious influences on the strain rates. The maximal values and the vibration frequencies of strain rate are in-creased as support stiffness increased. The maximal values of strain rate are decreased as support damping increased, and the attenuation values of strain rate are accelerated. Calculations show that it will result in an overestimation of DIF (Dy-namic Increase Factor) to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> rate instead of the strain rate...|$|R

40|$|In (exploratory) factor analysis, <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> matrix is {{identified}} {{only up to}} orthogonal rotation. For identifiability, one thus often <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> matrix to be lower triangular with positive diagonal entries. In Bayesian inference, a standard practice is then to specify a prior under which the loadings are independent, the off-diagonal loadings are normally distributed, and the diagonal loadings follow a truncated normal distribution. This prior specification, however, depends in an important way on how the variables and associated rows of <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> matrix are ordered. We show how a minor modification of the approach allows one to compute with the identifiable lower triangular loading matrix but maintain invariance properties under reordering of the variables...|$|R
