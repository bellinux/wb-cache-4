5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character {{has been seen as}} a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother.</b> On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

Although Angelou's grandmother died early in the series, in her third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, Angelou quoted her many times throughout the series. Angelou's desire for security for Guy drove her to marry Tosh Angelos in Singin' and Swingin, and drove many of her decisions, job choices, and romantic relationships. Scholar Siphokazi Koyana stated that due to Angelou's race and economic background, her [...] "experience of motherhood is inseparably intertwined with work". [...] According to Koyana, [...] "...Black motherhood always encompassed work". Angelou's long list of occupations attested to the challenges, especially in her second autobiography Gather Together in My Name, she faced as a working teenager mother, which often led Angelou to questionable decisions. [...] Koyana stated {{that it was not}} until Angelou was {{able to take advantage of}} opportunities, such as her role in Porgy and Bess, when she was able to fully support her and Guy, and the quality of her life and her contribution to society improved. [...] It was impossible, however, for Angelou to become successful without her extended family to provide childcare for her; i.e., when she left Guy in the care of his grandmother in spite of the conflict and guilt she experienced as a result (something Koyana insisted was imposed on her by the larger society), a pattern established in Caged Bird by her own mother when she left Angelou and her brother in the care of Angelou's grandmother.|$|E
500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E

However, {{by the end of the}} century, a cultural counter movement had begun. Janet Chafetz identified in a study 32 first-wave antifeminist movements, including those in the 19th century and early 20th century movements. These countermovements were in response to some women's growing demands, which were perceived as threatening to the standard way of life. Though men were not the only antifeminists, men experienced what some have called a [...] "crisis of masculinity" [...] in response to traditional gender roles being challenged. Men's responses to increased feminism varied. Some men even subscribed to feminist ideology, but others went the other direction and became decidedly antifeminist.
