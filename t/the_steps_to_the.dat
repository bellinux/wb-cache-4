5|$|Even {{though it}} was {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right. The building was actually substantially extended in 1475, {{with the construction of}} a large new sanctuary. There was also a Rood screen and loft, with a carved image of Christ crucified, with the figures of Mary and St John either side, though this is now gone, although <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> loft may still be seen to {{the north side of the}} chancel.|$|E

25|$|Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. These {{prayers are}} said by the sacred ministers {{standing}} {{on the floor at}} the bottom of the steps leading up to the High Altar. They are also said to each other, kneeling, by the acolytes and those servers sitting in the liturgical choir. If the acolytes are close enough, they may say them with the sacred ministers. These prayers consist primarily of Psalm 42 with the verses said alternately between the celebrant and the other sacred ministers. While these prayers are being said, the musical choir is singing the text of the Introit. After the prayers are finished, all rise. The sacred ministers ascend <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> altar to cense it.|$|E
25|$|Granite {{quarrying}} {{started at}} Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but {{became a major}} industry following {{the completion of a}} railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned monument in King's honor; the Foundation later chose to use granite imported from China. Unfortunately, quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.|$|E

25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed {{that his wife was}} seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running {{along the top of the}} wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tower gate, but it would not open. At the bottom of the stairs was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.|$|E

500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way down <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above my head and points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E

As the players left the field, the crowd sang a chorus of [...] "For he's a jolly good fellow" [...] in tribute to Trautmann's bravery. Roy Paul led his team up <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal box to receive Manchester City's third FA Cup. Trautmann's neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and the Duke of Edinburgh commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Three days later, an examination revealed that Trautmann had broken a bone in his neck.|$|E
500|$|At {{the apex}} of Han society was the emperor, {{a member of the}} Liu family and thus a {{descendant}} of the founder Emperor Gaozu (r. 202 195 BCE). His subjects were not allowed to address him by name; instead they used indirect references such as [...] "under <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne" [...] (bixia 陛下) or [...] "superior one" [...] (shang 上). If a commoner, government minister, or noble entered the palace without official permission, the punishment was execution. Although the Commandant of Justice—one of the central government's Nine Ministers—was in charge of meting out sentences in court cases, the emperor not only had the ability to override the Commandant's decision, but also had the sole ability to draft new laws or repeal old ones. An emperor could pardon anyone and grant general amnesties. Although the emperor often obeyed the majority consensus of his ministers in court conferences (tingyi 廷議), his approval was still needed for any state policy decision and he sometimes even rejected the majority opinion.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} later, {{hundreds}} of people participated in a protest and march organized by UVA faculty as [...] "part {{of a series of}} responses to the recently published Rolling Stone article". A student quoted in The Daily Progress said that men at a nearby bar were [...] "quick to yell 'insults and slurs' at the protestors as they walked by". A local business owner expressed support of non-violent demonstrations and told The Cavalier Daily that [...] "The only way thing change is if you talk about what's happening." [...] The march ended outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house where protesters challenged a perceived [...] "culture of sexual assault at the University". Community members offered suggestions for immediate steps administration could take to implement preventative measures and address safety concerns regarding sexual assault. One student protestor told The Cavalier Daily: [...] "I really hope the University takes this article and the protest movement as a sign {{that they need to be}} more transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault." [...] Four participants who were sitting on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Phi Kappa Psi house were arrested on trespassing charges for refusing to move when police officers asked them to leave.|$|E
