5|$|An {{investigation}} {{conducted by}} the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide.

5|$|In 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>government</b> {{announced}} {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo.

5|$|In December 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>government</b> {{outlined}} that it {{planned to}} purchase 164 aircraft by 2018.

By then, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>government</b> had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kiev Aircraft Production Plant was expected to produce the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight test programme had reached its final stages {{by the end of}} 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries would approve of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people onboard were injured. It looked as though the A400M was now going to have the market all to itself. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.|$|E
