40|$|Mathematical {{analysis}} tools are changing how businesses function; improving {{the use of}} these tools can result in significant profit gains. There are many challenges when implementing these tools, one of the largest being data issues. For example, real daily sales data is often not well conditioned enough to yield good estimates of the underlying demand function. Daily sales data, however, is typically aggregated from <b>transactions</b> <b>data</b> that details all the products sold in each individual <b>transaction.</b> This <b>data</b> clearly reveals more information than daily sales data, since daily sales data does not reveal which products are frequently or rarely sold together. If the relationship between consumer demand and <b>transactions</b> <b>data</b> was understood, this data may provide a more reliable source to estimate underlying consumer demand than daily sales data.

There is strong evidence that magnet effects are caused by uninformed individuals, whereas if trade volumes are dominated by institutions, no significant magnet effect is found.

Proponents of price limits argue that they {{provide an opportunity for}} investors to reevaluate market information and make more rational trading decisions. We identify three different limit hits - closing, single, and consecutive - and hypothesize that only the consecutive limit hits are likely to provide such an opportunity, namely, to counter investor overreaction (volatility hypothesis) and to enhance information revelation (information asymmetry hypothesis). Our empirical evidence supports the volatility hypothesis. Our findings generate important policy implications for stock markets that have price limits.

For that purpose, we consider a specific optional sampling {{in which a}} continuous-time Markov process is observed only when it crosses some discrete level.

A simple nonparametric test then follows by examining whether this conditional independence property holds. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the asymptotic test has huge size distortions, though a bootstrap-based variant entails reasonable size and power properties in finite samples. As for an empirical illustration, we investigate whether bid-ask spreads follow Markov processes using <b>transactions</b> <b>data</b> from the New York Stock Exchange. The motivation lies {{on the fact that}} asymmetric information models of market microstructures predict that the Markov property does not hold for the bid-ask spread.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework {{to process the}} transactions under the active heterogeneous database systems. In order to perform a correct schedule of transactions with high performance, the framework provides a semantic-based concurrency control on the global level. It relaxes the correct criterion (global serializability) to allow the global sub-transactions on each site to execute in different order. The globe <b>transaction</b> includes <b>data</b> <b>transactions</b> and rule <b>transactions.</b> A <b>data</b> <b>transaction</b> is a general database transaction. A rule transaction is formed by active rules during the <b>data</b> <b>transaction.</b> During the global <b>transaction</b> process, both <b>data</b> and rule <b>transactions</b> are managed by different control modules. The <b>data</b> <b>transaction</b> will be decomposed into several globe sub-transactions. The globe semantic based transaction module will produce a correct parallel schedule for the global sub-transactions. The rule transaction may generate new global transactions during the rule inference. The advantage of providing semantic-based transaction on global level will reduce the abort producing by the wrong global order of local database schedule and improve {{the performance of the}} global transaction...|$|R
