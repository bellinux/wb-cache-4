Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard right conservative in the mold of a Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork.

On <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>issue,</b> he stated that he would look at that {{with an open mind}} but would not state how he would rule on Roe v.

25|$|A poll {{conducted}} for KSTP-TV in the Twin Cities in October showed Oberstar ahead of Cravaack {{by only one}} point, 47 to 46 percent. Cravaack received the endorsement of former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as the polls tightened. He was also endorsed by Minnesota's largest pro-life organization, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, and the largest newspaper in the district, the Duluth News Tribune. In the November 2 election, Cravaack scored {{one of the biggest}} upsets in Minnesota political history, defeating Oberstar by only 4,400 votes, 48 percent to 47 percent. Cravaack believed <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>issue</b> was crucial to his victory; he had argued that the health care legislation that Oberstar had voted for allowed for the payment of abortions with taxpayer funds, and encouraged euthanasia for the elderly. By the time he won the election, Cravaack characterized the bill as an example of socialized medicine that will result in the rationing of medical care.|$|E

40|$|Abortion and {{violence}} are global issues, yet different culture might {{respond to the}} issues somewhat differently. This study aims to reveal <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> {{and violence}} <b>issues</b> in Jane Martin’s Keely and Du in terms of pro-choice and pro life movements and see how Indonesian students reading the play respond to the issues.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{genetics}} and <b>abortion</b> <b>issue</b> {{is an extension}} of <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> debate and <b>the</b> disability rights movement. Since the advent of forms of prenatal diagnosis, such as amniocentesis and ultrasound, it has become possible to detect the presence of congenital disorders in the fetus before birth. Specifically, disability-selective <b>abortion</b> is <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> of fetuses that are found to have non-fatal mental or physical defects detected through prenatal testing. Many prenatal tests are now considered routine, such as testing for Down syndrome. Women who are discovered to be carrying fetuses with disabilities are often faced with the decision of whether to abort or to prepare to parent a child with disabilities.|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to American understandings of abortion as a uniquely tragic dilemma, <b>the</b> Israeli <b>abortion</b> <b>issue</b> is a tangential controversy {{in a larger}} debate over {{the relationship between the}} state’s national and democratic identity. The divergent paths of abortion politics in Israel and the United States reflect important differences in underlying religious doctrines, geographical size, feminist ideologies, and the immediacy of other social cleavages. More profoundly, <b>the</b> two <b>abortion</b> stories are <b>the</b> product of distinct understandings of the mutual obligations between citizens and their state and of the relationship between individual and collective rights and duties. While these differences may account for the capacity of Israeli activists on both sides to forge pragmatic compromises, the stability of these policies is uncertain both because of changing Israeli priorities and the import of American conceptions of <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> dispute...|$|R

40|$|Do {{forces that}} {{impacted}} feminist {{beliefs in the}} past, such as gender and generation, impact feminist beliefs today within <b>the</b> context of <b>abortion</b> policy support? While <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> rights <b>issue</b> was framed during the feminist movement era as a feminist issue, it is now clearly framed along partisan and ideological lines. Public opinion on issues that percolated through the feminist movement and identified as feminist issues in the past {{may no longer be}} viewed as feminist <b>issues</b> today. <b>The</b> <b>abortion</b> rights <b>issue</b> was chosen because of the oft-held perception that it is solely a women’s issue. The strong association of <b>abortion</b> rights with <b>the</b> feminist movement makes opinion on abortion rights an appropriate domain in which to analyze the relative impact of gender, generation and feminist beliefs on policy support. Data from the 2004 American National Election Study showed that neither gender nor generation achieved a significant impact on feminist beliefs. Men’s and women’s exposure to the feminist movement, the ideals that the movement sought, and certain policies advanced by the movement, such as abortion rights, achieve disparate impact across generations among women and among men. These findings are critical when one questions how feminist policy questions will be approached and responded to by the public and political elites in the future as feminist beliefs may be a less meaningful precursor to both feminist policy support and issues framed in feminist terms than {{they have been in the}} past...|$|R
