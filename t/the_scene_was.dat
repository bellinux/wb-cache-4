5|$|In post-production, Universal {{decided to}} film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy's characters. Murphy, however, refused to return unless he were paid a further $500,000 {{on top of}} his $7.5million salary. The studio {{declined}} to pay the additional money and <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> not shot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode the camera follows a BA Falcon, a model of vehicle which was not {{released}} until late 2002. This was some 7 years after <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> set.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} in which the crew meets Redfoot after the botched drug deal, Redfoot flicks his {{cigarette}} at McManus' face. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> originally to have Redfoot flick the cigarette at McManus's chest, but the actor missed and hit Baldwin's face by accident. Baldwin's reaction is genuine.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy scene was based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> {{captured}} on film by cameraman Frank Lennon. The picture became iconic in Canada. Canada held {{on for the}} win {{in the game and}} thus won the series, four games to three. Pat Stapleton picked up the puck after the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> {{damaged in}} protest by James Anstice, {{a member of}} the Jesus Fellowship Church, who pushed over one of the figures and knocked the head off another. He was later ordered to pay £100 in compensation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{staged in}} Kraków.|$|R

5|$|The {{scene where}} Donna and the Doctor {{investigate}} Adipose {{was difficult to}} film. The scene took thirty shots to complete, and Tennant and Tate experienced problems avoiding each other on-screen. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed in Picture Finance's call centre {{on the outskirts of}} Newport on an early Sunday morning, with the company's telephonists serving as extras.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles had {{received}} a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, {{there was no time}} to have it filed before shooting the scene. When <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.|$|E
5|$|A {{seamless}} 40-second driving scene, {{in which}} Michael Sullivan {{and his son}} travel into Chicago from the countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed at LaSalle Street, and {{due to the lack}} of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{staged in}} a noble village.|$|R
5000|$|However, some of <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> have <b>been</b> [...] "enhanced" [...] for viewers' entertainment, and the {{way that}} <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> cut {{together}} pushes strongly on the conventions of a comedy sketch show.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> city <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded}} in Norrtälje and <b>the</b> countryside <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded in}} Västerhaninge.|$|R
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin then cast Florence D. Lee as the Blind Girl's {{grandmother}} and shot scenes with Cherrill and Lee for five weeks. In late 1929, Chaplin re-shot the first Flower Shop scene with Cherrill. This time, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> completed {{in six days}} and Chaplin was happy with Cherrill's performance. Chaplin had been shooting the film {{for a year and}} was only a little more than half way finished. From March to April 1930, Chaplin shot the scenes inside of the millionaire's house at the Town House on Wilshire Boulevard. He hired Joe Van Meter and Albert Austin, whom he had known since his days working for Fred Karno, as the burglars. In the late spring of 1930, Chaplin shot the last major comedy sequence: the boxing match. Chaplin hired Keystone actor Hank Mann to play the Tramp's opponent. The scene required 100 extras and Chaplin took four days to rehearse and six to shoot the scene and was shot between June 23 and 30. Chaplin was initially nervous over the attendance for this scene so he invited his friends to be extras. Over 100 extras were present. Chaplin’s performance in <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> so humorous that more people arrived daily to be an extra.|$|E

5|$|During post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth {{his opinion}} of the scene when {{hundreds}} of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before saying that the suspense might be ruined if <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and {{was impressed with the}} result. C. E. Biggs was the film's audio engineer.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Shaw {{was chosen}} for the small but crucial role of unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, {{the third and final}} film in the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy. Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard Death Star II when Luke Skywalker unmasks his dying father. Since <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> unquestionably the emotional climax of the film, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|In early 1928, Chaplin {{began writing}} the script with Harry Carr. The plot {{gradually}} grew from an initial concept Chaplin had considered after {{the success of}} The Circus, where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls. This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp for the first time. A highly detailed description of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> written, as Chaplin considered {{it to be the}} center of the entire film.|$|E

5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge {{that he ought to}} look away. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> popular with English artists as {{it was one of the}} few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E
5|$|On 5 March 2012, {{prior to}} release, Kolkata Metro {{authorities}} objected to {{a scene in}} which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained that nothing in the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, and <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> retained, although it was removed from trailers.|$|E
5|$|Patty Hearst guest {{stars in}} the episode, {{something}} that was planned since July 2006. Hearst {{did not know that}} she would be appearing on the show until after she was chosen {{due to a lack of}} communication between her and her agent. She was reluctant to appear as a character similar to herself, but she eventually agreed. In addition, Hearst's character was initially scheduled to have a lesbian kiss with Keri Lynn Pratt's character, but <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> vetoed by the network for unknown reasons.|$|E
