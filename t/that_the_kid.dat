5|$|During his quest, the Kid meets {{two more}} survivors: Zulf, an {{ambassador}} from the Ura, underground-dwelling {{people with whom}} Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl {{who was raised in}} Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: [...] "It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's {{probably}} something <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> made up, {{but at the time}} I believed him." ...|$|E

60|$|Menzi, {{distinguishing}} {{her voice}} amid the tumult, {{asked what was}} the matter. Someone told him, whereon he commanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> should be brought to him and the snake also. This was done, Tabitha following her dying pet with her mother, for by now Thomas had departed, taking no heed of these events, which perhaps he was too disturbed to notice.|$|E
60|$|The {{shepherd}} {{could hardly}} believe his eyes {{when he returned from}} seeking the sheep and found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> had vanished. He was afraid to go home and tell the same tale that he had told yesterday; so he searched the wood through and through till night was nearly come. Then he felt that there was no help for it, and he must go home and confess to his master.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of old Sanchez's Mexican sheep herders did it!--think of it! the Frio Kid {{killed by}} a sheep herder! The Greaser saw him riding along past his camp about twelve o'clock last night, and was so skeered that he up with a Winchester and let him have it. Funniest {{part of it was}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> was dressed all up with white Angora-skin {{whiskers}} and a regular Santy Claus rig-out from head to foot. Think of the Frio Kid playing Santy!" ...|$|E
50|$|Later when Bama goes to Parvathi's portion, Parvathi {{lies that}} her husband is college principal. When she tells that she has only two children, Sita lets <b>the</b> other three <b>kids</b> out of <b>the</b> locked room. Bama thinks <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are orphans, and Parvathi, who doesn't know English, agrees <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are orphans. Sita makes fun of this. Finally, when Bama arrives at Krishnan's part of the house, she gets a {{spectacular}} welcome with red carpet, flowers and her favourite drinks. They even take a few snaps with her.|$|R

6000|$|He began {{describing}} {{the kid who}} was still asleep in the cab. I did some quick thinking. Evidently the family was {{on the trail of}} the kid, and the sheriff had received telegraphed instructions from Oregon. Yes, I had seen the kid. I had met him first in Ogden. The date tallied with the sheriff's information. But the kid was still behind somewhere, I explained, for he had been ditched from that very overland that night when it pulled out of Rock Springs. And all the time I was praying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> wouldn't wake up, come down out of the cab, and put the [...] "kibosh" [...] on me.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} in old Justo Valdos's gambling house. There was a poker game at which sat {{players who were}} not all friends, as happens often where men ride in from afar to shoot Folly as she gallops. There was a row over so small a matter {{as a pair of}} queens; and when the smoke had cleared away it was found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> had committed an indiscretion, and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder. For, the unfortunate combatant, instead of being a Greaser, was a high-blooded youth from the cow ranches, of about the Kid's own age and possessed of friends and champions. His blunder in missing the Kid's right ear only a sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the indiscretion of the better marksman.|$|E

60|$|Assisted by her friend, who {{was evidently}} {{enormously}} impressed by Irene's intimacy with me, {{she gave me}} a good deal of miscellaneous information, as that William's real name was Mr. Hicking, but that he was known in their street, {{because of the number of}} his shirts, as Toff Hicking. That the street held he should get away from the club before two in the morning, for his missus needed him more than the club needed him. That William replied (very sensibly) that if the club was short of waiters at supper-time some of the gentlemen might be kept waiting for their marrow-bone. That he sat up with his missus most of the night, and pretended to her that he got some nice long naps at the club. That what she talked to him about mostly was the kid. <b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> was in another part of London (in charge of a person called the old woman), because there was an epidemic in Irene's street.|$|E

You wouldn't believe {{there was a time}} when I thought he was a big man, when I was kind of proud to live in the same city with him. She'll tell you how I used to come home from the store and talk about him after supper, and hope <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> there would grow up into a {{financier}} like Eldon Parr. The boys at the store talked about him: he sort of laid hold on our imaginations with the library he gave, and Elmwood Park, and the picture of the big organ in your church in the newspapers--and sometimes, Mary and me and the boy, in the baby carriage, on Sunday afternoons we used to walk around by his house, just to look at it. You couldn't have got me to believe that Eldon Parr would put his name to anything that wasn't straight.|$|E

5000|$|Interpreting [...] a Midrash {{taught that}} God tested Moses through his {{experience}} as a shepherd. Our Rabbis said that when Moses was tending Jethro's flock in the wilderness, a little kid escaped. Moses ran after the kid until it reached a shady place, where the kid stopped to drink at a pool of water. Moses reasoned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> had run away because it was thirsty and concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> must be weary. So Moses carried the kid back on his shoulder. Thereupon God decided that because Moses had mercy leading a person's flock, Moses would assuredly tend God's flock Israel. Hence [...] says, [...] "Now Moses was keeping the flock." ...|$|E
