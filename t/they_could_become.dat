5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church was {{attractive}} to women because it offered professional opportunities when {{it was difficult for}} women to find work outside the home. As Christian Scientists <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of the Christian Science Journal, 12 were women.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a waffle. They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E

50|$|In pre-vocalic positions, the phonemes u {{and i were}} semi-vowels, {{probably}} pronounced like English w and y, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> also <b>become</b> pure vowels {{when the}} following ablaut vowel reduced to zero.|$|R
30|$|After {{accessing}} to the EU in 2007, for Bulgarians and Romanians {{there was}} a transition period for 7  years. They needed a work permit and {{there was a}} ceiling to the number of permits issued. However if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> proof <b>they</b> had an income of their own, <b>they</b> also <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a resident.|$|R
5|$|The {{religion}} {{entered a}} new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> involved {{in the social and}} economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.|$|E
5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|The 26-year-old FitzRoy had {{hopes of}} {{commanding}} a second expedition {{to continue the}} South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer supported this, he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians who had been taught English {{with the idea that}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> missionaries. He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed.|$|E

5000|$|Legal {{restrictions}} {{continued to}} be made related to African servants. The courts likely reasoned, [...] "Insofar as Negroes were heathens, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> never <b>become</b> Englishmen; insofar as they were not Englishmen, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be entitled to the protections of the common law", {{which at the time}} was limited to English subjects. Africans were considered foreigners or aliens.|$|R

25|$|According to Peake's {{commentary}} on the Bible, the Priestly Code specifies that individuals were washed before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> members of the Jewish priesthood, and similarly requires Levites to be cleansed before they assume their work.|$|E
25|$|International {{maritime}} trade publications including TradeWinds, Fairplay and Lloyd's List regularly presented the dispute as a possibly precedent-setting {{one that could}} prove fateful for international classification societies, whose assets are dwarfed by the scale of claims to which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> subject.|$|E

50|$|Assimilation was one ideological {{basis of}} French colonial {{policy in the}} 19th and 20th centuries. In {{contrast}} with British imperial policy, the French taught their subjects that, by adopting French language and culture, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> eventually <b>become</b> French. The famous 'Four Communes' in Senegal were seen as proof of this. Here Africans were afforded all the rights of French citizens.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{problems}} associated with wire aging, charging effects and self-sustaining cathode currents in the TMAE based photo-detectors. It is generally believed that anode wire aging is the most serious problem encountered in TMAE (tetrakis dimethylamino ethylene) -based Cherenkov ring imaging detectors. Although charging effects and self-sustaining cathod currents have not been studied systematically, there is concern that <b>they</b> too <b>could</b> <b>become</b> significant {{over a long period of}} time...|$|R

25|$|The Oberlin Band's Annual Report for 1899 {{mentions}} rumors {{among the}} Chinese that the Christian missionaries were poisoning wells. This {{was perhaps the}} first harbinger in Shanxi of the Boxers—an anti-Christian, anti-foreign peasant movement that began in Shandong province in 1898 and spread north and west. The Boxers were a millenarian movement which believed that by observing the proper rituals <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> invulnerable to Christian bullets and kill or expel the hated foreigners from China. A drought exacerbated the growing unrest in the countryside.|$|E
25|$|With its eight daily round trips, Maersk Air only {{captured}} {{ten percent}} of the market on the Copenhagen–Stockholm route, losing money on it. Maersk therefore started negotiations with British Airways and KLM to see if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> part of an airline alliance. They were in close negotiations with what would become Oneworld, but pulled out in the last minute. There were two main concerns: the first was that Maersk would have to become a franchise partner of British Airways, and that they had already started negotiating with SAS.|$|E
25|$|There were, of course, various {{privileges}} {{which the}} Jews, {{like any other}} non-Lutherans, could still not obtain {{as long as the}} then current constitution of the Swedish kingdom remained in force. Thus, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>become</b> members of the cabinet; nor <b>could</b> <b>they,</b> as judges or as members of committees, take part in discussions concerning religious questions. Otherwise they enjoyed the same rights and were subject to the same duties as the Swedish citizens of the Lutheran faith.|$|R
5000|$|One {{negative}} review {{came from}} Pauline Kael, who called it [...] "trite", but said: [...] "You {{can see the}} big pushes for powerful effects, yet it isn't negligible. It wrenches audiences, making them fear that <b>they,</b> too, <b>could</b> <b>become</b> like this man. And when events strip off his armor, he doesn't discover a new, warm humanity, he discovers sharper suffering—just what his armor had protected him from. Most of the intensity comes from Steiger's performance." ...|$|R
50|$|Francoism professed {{a strong}} devotion to militarism, hypermasculinity and the {{traditional}} {{role of women in}} society. A woman was to be loving to her parents and brothers, faithful to her husband, and to reside with her family. Official propaganda confined women's roles to family care and motherhood. Most progressive laws passed by the Second Republic were declared void. Women <b>could</b> not <b>become</b> judges, or testify in trial. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not <b>become</b> university professors. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was increasing liberalization, yet such measures would continue until Franco's death.|$|R
25|$|Slaves were {{considered}} property and lacked legal personhood. Over time, they acquired a few protections under Roman law. Some slaves were freed by manumission for services rendered, {{or through a}} testamentary provision when their master died. Once free, they faced few barriers, beyond normal social snobbery, to participating in Roman society. The principle that a person could become a citizen by law rather than birth was enshrined in Roman mythology; when Romulus defeated the Sabines in battle, he promised the war captives that were in Rome <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> citizens.|$|E
25|$|Led by Elendil, nine ships {{carrying}} the faithful Númenóreans were saved from the Downfall and escaped the cataclysm. These Númenórean exiles founded the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor in Middle-earth. At first {{they believed that}} Sauron had perished in the Downfall, but it soon became evident that the Dark Lord had returned to Mordor when Mount Doom erupted. The Appendices in The Return of the King recount that while Sauron's power {{had not yet been}} fully rebuilt, he had decided to attack the Númenóreans before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> too strong in their new realms.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the Italian {{physician}} Carlo Urbani (1956–2003) was {{the first}} to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the World Health Organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.|$|E

25|$|The Sydney Roosters {{entered the}} Grand Final from a {{markedly}} different path {{to that of}} the Dragons. The Roosters had finished the 2009 season {{on the bottom of the}} ladder. Under new coach Brian Smith, and having signed troubled star Todd Carney, the Roosters improved to finish sixth on the ladder in 2010, before consecutive finals series victories against the Wests Tigers, the Penrith Panthers and the Gold Coast Titans launched the club into the Grand Final. The Roosters were thus in a position where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> the first club since the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1934 to win a premiership after finishing last in the previous season.|$|E
25|$|The {{religion}} {{entered a}} new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. In December 1983 the national assembly registered with the government as an NGO. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> involved {{in the social and}} economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1980, the Haitian Bahá'í community started an elementary school (Anís Zunúzí), later joined by a forest protection program, and a variety of village kindergartens.|$|E

5|$|At other times, Krichell {{collected}} some of {{the best}} prospects in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice in the morning and a full game in the afternoon. There, Krichell and his staff sorted though players <b>they</b> believed <b>could</b> <b>become</b> useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation. The few players who survived the workout were assigned by Krichell to the Yankees Minor League hierarchy.|$|R
2500|$|The {{issue of}} what exactly defines a vacant niche, also known as empty niche, and whether they exist in {{ecosystems}} is controversial. The subject is intimately tied into a much broader debate on whether ecosystems can reach equilibrium, where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> theoretically <b>become</b> maximally saturated with species. Given that saturation {{is a measure of}} the number of species per resource axis per ecosystem, the question becomes: is it useful to define unused resource clusters as niche 'vacancies'? ...|$|R
50|$|Some pre-colonial social {{structures}} of the Philippines gave equal importance to maternal and paternal lineage. This bilateral kinship system accorded Philippine women enormous power within a clan. They were entitled to property, engage in a trade and could exercise their right to divorce her husband. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> also <b>become</b> village chiefs {{in the absence of}} a male heir. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, Filipino women could also achieve status as medicine women or high-priestesses and astrologers.|$|R
