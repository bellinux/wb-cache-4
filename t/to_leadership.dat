5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and {{there were to be}} no African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks <b>to</b> <b>leadership</b> posts in the military.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} before his {{retirement}} on August 1, 1965, the national council began a program to update the Wood Badge program and shift its emphasis from teaching Scoutcraft <b>to</b> <b>leadership</b> skills. After he was officially retired, his opinion was still sought after and respected. Dr. John W. Larson, Director of Boy Scout Leader Training for the National Council, was working with Béla H. Bánáthy and Bob Perin, Assistant National Director, Volunteer Training Service, to adapt the leadership competencies of the White Stag Leadership Development Program into a new Wood Badge syllabus.|$|E

5|$|The Region Cadet Leadership Schools (RCLS) provide {{training}} to increase knowledge, skills, and attitudes as they pertain <b>to</b> <b>leadership</b> and management.

RCLSs are conducted at region level, or at wing level with region approval.

One variation on this theme are CAP Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer Schools and Academies, which are cadet NCO schools designed to teach basic leadership and principles to cadet leaders during their earlier duty positions in the cadet program.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Stevens {{was elected}} {{to serve on the}} National Council of the National Woman's Party. The {{following}} year, when Alice Paul returned from a two-year trip to Switzerland to establish the World Woman’s Party (WWP), difficulties arose. Paul experienced both challenges to the direction she was taking the NWP and had personality conflicts with members, including Stevens. When Alva Belmont died in 1933, the bequest she had promised Stevens for years of personal service was instead directed to the NWP. Stevens sued the estate, eventually receiving US$12,000, but she believed that Paul had sabotaged her relationship with Belmont. After Paul's resignation in 1945, Stevens did not support Paul's hand-selected replacement, Anita Pollitzer and led an unsuccessful attempt to challenge her leadership. Pollitzer was seen as a figurehead for Paul and an internal dispute arose over the NWP’s emphasis on the WWP and international rights rather than domestic organizing. During these tensions, a dissenting faction of NWP members tried to take over party headquarters and elect their own slate of officers, but Pollitzer’s claim <b>to</b> <b>leadership</b> was supported by a ruling of a federal district judge.|$|E
