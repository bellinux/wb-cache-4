Another of the territory's railway networks, the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR), adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed Common Stored Value Ticket. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to Citybus, and was also extended to {{a limited number of}} non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.|$|E
5|$|The toxins {{found in}} Galerina marginata {{are known as}} amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide {{derivatives}} composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood <b>to</b> <b>recirculate</b> and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in gastrointestinal bleeding, a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.|$|E

25|$|But not all {{responses}} were positive. Joseph Stalin argued in 1924 that Reed was misleading {{in regards to}} Leon Trotsky. The book portrays Trotsky (head of the Red Army) {{as a man who}} co-led the revolution with Lenin and mentions Stalin only twice—one of them being only in the recitation of a list of names, as both Lenin and Trotsky were internationally known, whereas the activities of other Bolshevik militants were virtually unknown. Russian writer Anatoly Rybakov elaborates on Stalinist Soviet Union’s ban on Ten Days that Shook the World: “The main task was to build a mighty socialist state. For that, mighty power was needed. Stalin was at the head of that power, which mean that he stood at its source with Lenin. Together with Lenin he led the October Revolution. John Reed had presented the history of October differently. That wasn’t the John Reed we needed.” After Stalin’s death, the book was allowed <b>to</b> <b>recirculate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ethylene is {{produced}} in the petrochemical industry by steam cracking. In this process, gaseous or light liquid hydrocarbons are heated to 750–950°C, inducing numerous free radical reactions followed by immediate quench to stop these reactions. This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated compression and distillation. In a related process used in oil refineries, high molecular weight hydrocarbons are cracked over zeolite catalysts. Heavier feedstocks, such as naphtha and gas oils require at least two [...] "quench towers" [...] downstream of the cracking furnaces <b>to</b> <b>recirculate</b> pyrolysis-derived gasoline and process water. When cracking a mixture of ethane and propane, only one water quench tower is required.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dome and}} swirler are {{the part of}} the {{combustor}} that the primary air (see Air flow paths below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use bluff body domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products <b>to</b> <b>recirculate,</b> creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|E

In the present study a first attempt to formulate a new one-equation subgrid model is presented which reduces the need of this type of user-modifications.

50|$|In early 20th century {{automobiles}} {{prior to}} the introduction of power steering, the effect of a flat or blowout on one of the front wheels tended to pull the steering mechanism toward the side with the flat tire. The use of a worm screw reduced this effect. Further worm drive development led <b>to</b> <b>recirculating</b> ball bearings <b>to</b> reduce frictional forces, which transmitted some steering force to the wheel. This aids vehicle control and reduces wear that could cause difficulties in steering precisely.|$|R
2500|$|On April 2013, after further vandalism, mayor Horacio Quiroga {{announced}} further {{reforms to}} the monument. [...] The original cover limestone, affected {{by years of}} being painted and cleaned, was replaced by two layers of granite. The inner layer, was composed of natural granite, while the external was covered with flamed granite to avoid paint adhesion. Water pipes {{were built in the}} interior to produce a waterfall effect on the four sides of the pedestal, and a fountain on the base <b>to</b> <b>recirculate</b> the water. All the lights on the monument were replaced by LED lightning. The commemorative plaques were restored and placed under the waterfalls. The works started in February 2014, with an estimated cost of ARS1,7 million. The renewals were performed by [...] the company H.G. Construcciones S.A, and finished in July 2014. The reinauguration of the monument was scheduled for August 17, 2014, the anniversary of San martin's death.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready <b>to</b> <b>recirculate.</b> The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.|$|E

40|$|The {{climate control}} load {{is the most}} {{significant}} auxiliary loads present in vehicles today. The peak climate control load of an AC system in sedan can be as large as the engine input power. As the attention on vehicle energy economy is rising worldwide, the energy-saving of mobile air conditioning {{is becoming more and more}} important. Most mobile AC systems nowadays draw air from outside the vehicle and cool it to the desired comfort level inside the vehicle. Lots of energy is wasted during this process due to continuously cooling the hotter outside air instead of cooling the â€œcoolerâ€ inside air. Compared to that, defaulting <b>to</b> <b>recirculated</b> cabin air will certainly be energy-saving. Though some studies have revealed the energy saving effectiveness under bench test conditions, it is still unclear how much energy can be saved when mobile AC systems are operated in different climates and driving patterns. The GREEN-MAC-LCCP tool is modelled to evaluate the life cycle climate performance of mobile AC system, and it is well-accepted. This tool is capable of analysing the full cycle of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of alternative refrigerant systems and different system structures. In this article, the energy-saving effect of defaulting <b>to</b> <b>recirculated</b> cabin air is evaluated using GREEN-MAC-LCCP. It is found that 7 %- 48 % of energy saving can be achieved under the calculated climate conditions...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} <b>to</b> <b>recirculating</b> aquaculture systems {{is the need}} for periodic water exchanges. However, the rate of water exchange can be reduced through aquaponics, such as the incorporation of hydroponically grown plants and denitrification. Both methods reduce the amount of nitrate in the water, and can potentially eliminate the need for water exchanges, closing the aquaculture system from the environment. The amount of interaction between the aquaculture system and the environment can be measured through the cumulative feed burden (CFB kg/M3), which measures the amount of feed that goes into the RAS relative to the amount of water and waste discharged.|$|R
