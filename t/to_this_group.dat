5|$|Members of the Basidiomycota, {{commonly}} known as the club fungi or basidiomycetes, produce meiospores called basidiospores on club-like stalks called basidia. Most common mushrooms belong <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group,</b> as well as rust and smut fungi, which are major pathogens of grains. Other important basidiomycetes include the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis, human commensal species of the genus Malassezia, and the opportunistic human pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans.|$|E
5|$|Temperate sundews: These species form a tight {{cluster of}} unfurled leaves called a hibernaculum in a winter {{dormancy}} period (= Hemicryptophyte). All of the North American and European species belong <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> Drosera arcturi from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand is another temperate species that dies {{back to a}} horn-shaped hibernaculum.|$|E
5|$|The Sun-grazing comets of 1668, 1689, 1702 and 1945 seem to {{be closely}} related to those of 1882 and 1965, {{although}} their orbits are not well enough determined to establish whether they broke off from the parent comet in 1106, or the previous perihelion passage before that, {{some time in the}} 3–5th centuries AD. This subgroup of comets is known as Subgroup II. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli, which was seen in 1970, is more closely related <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> than Subgroup I, but appears to have broken off during the previous orbit to the other fragments.|$|E

5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of Plymouth used terms {{to distinguish between}} the earliest settlers of the colony and those that came later. The first generation of settlers, generally thought to be those that arrived before 1627, called themselves the Old Comers or Planters. Later generations of Plymouth residents referred <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> as the Forefathers.|$|E
5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
25|$|The Germanic tribes {{originally}} inhabited southern Scandinavia, Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg, but subsequent Iron Age {{cultures of}} the same region, like Wessenstedt (800–600 BC) and Jastorf, may also have belonged <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>grouping.</b>|$|R

5|$|Governance of the Jerseys {{also created}} {{problems}} for Andros. James had awarded the territory {{west of the}} Hudson River to proprietors John Berkeley and George Carteret, and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion (which became known as West Jersey) to a partnership of Quakers. Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group,</b> and {{the exact nature of}} the rights James had given both Berkeley and Carteret was disputed, in part because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he had made to Berkeley and Carteret.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> of works, the Commission {{express the}} opinion that an enemy {{will not attempt to}} enter Washington from this direction, and that we cannot (as a general rule) expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops. What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E

50|$|The Vermillion {{meteorite}} {{is classified}} as a pyroxene pallasite because it contains pyroxene as an accessory mineral and shares a distinct oxygen isotope signature with Yamato 8451. Some studies also object <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>grouping,</b> referring <b>to</b> the differences in siderophile trace elements and the occurrence of cohenite in the Vermillion meteorite.|$|R

5|$|Other divine {{groups were}} {{composed}} of deities with interrelated roles, or who together represented {{a region of}} the Egyptian mythological cosmos. There were sets of gods for the {{hours of the day}} and night and for each nome (province) of Egypt. Some of these groups contain a specific, symbolically important number of deities. Paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity. Ra, who is dynamic and light-producing, and Osiris, who is static and shrouded in darkness, merge into a single god each night. Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought, and groups of four connote completeness. Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others: Amun, Ra, and Ptah. These deities stood for the plurality of all gods, as well as for their own cult centers (the major cities of Thebes, Heliopolis, and Memphis) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought. Sometimes Set, the patron god of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world, was added <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group,</b> which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon.|$|E
5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these, the deuterostomes {{also include the}} Hemichordata, or acorn worms, which {{are thought to be}} closely related to Echinodermata forming a group known as Ambulacraria.
