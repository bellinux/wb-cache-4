They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing.

25|$|Then, {{the dot-com}} boom {{that had been}} fueling California's record tax {{revenues}} burst unexpectedly {{because of the large}} number of high tech firms in California and California's dependence on state income taxes. When the dot-com boom turned <b>to</b> <b>bust,</b> state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits. Restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the state's credit rating became unpopular. The beginning shortfall for the 2002-2003 state budget was $23.6 billion. Davis announced that the 2003-2004 budget shortfall would be $34.6 billion while the Legislative Analyst projected a $21.1.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} boom {{spurred on by}} the California Gold Rush that had brought on {{the era of the}} clipper ships had turned <b>to</b> <b>bust.</b> All the secrets of building lofty clippers had been discovered and there were too many of them in existence. The dropping freight rates now gave no incentive to build any more. The San Francisco market was so saturated that many a disgusted ship captain dumped unwanted cargo overboard in the bay before sailing on to other ports. The diary of Robert Underhill, which recorded his 1856 travels on the Sweepstakes, revealed that Westervelt was also traveling on this voyage to San Francisco and the Orient. Underhill's entries made clear that Westervelt recognized the economic situation facing the port of New York and was seeking other possible venues for the family business.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{can create}} new money {{when they make}} a loan. New loans {{throughout}} the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2007, {{there was an increase}} in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from £750 billion to £1700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending. If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom <b>to</b> <b>bust</b> as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld won the UK Open Qualifier 5 {{by beating}} Andy Smith 6–3 in the final, after earlier {{overcoming}} {{the likes of}} Simon Whitlock and Terry Jenkins. He also hit a nine-dart finish in his third round match against Michael Barnard. He completed a weekend double by winning Event 6 a day later after defeating Ian White 6–2 in the final. In the UK Open itself, he beat Jelle Klaasen and Andy Hamilton to reach the last 16. In this match he played Peter Wright and looked to be exiting the tournament as Van Barneveld trailed 6–8, with his opponent on a 138 finish to win the match. Wright hit treble 20, single 18 and required a single 20 to leave double tops when he returned. However, he incredibly hit another treble 20 <b>to</b> <b>bust</b> his score and Van Barneveld went on to take a 9–8 victory. He played Dave Chisnall in the quarter-finals and never recovered from a poor start in which he lost the opening five legs and succumbed 5–10. However, Van Barneveld gained revenge over Chisnall in {{the final of the}} European Tour Event 3 in Düsseldorf, by defeating him 6–4 and claimed his first European Tour title.|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the episode, Phineas and Ferb's time machine is left in positive condition and available for further use at the museum. The writing staff purposely ended it this way so that they could reutilize it later in the series.
