40|$|As {{will become}} apparent, <b>the</b> {{condition}} <b>of</b> Australian family law, {{in almost all}} of its central areas, {{is in a state}} of genuine uncertainty. By way of introduction, it should be said that this state of affairs has been brought about because the major family law statute, the Family Law Act 1975, has been subject to continual amendment that has often lacked a sound conceptual basis. The Family Law Act 1975 has been amended, sometimes significantly, no fewer than eighty times from its coming into force in 1976. In addition, there has been a tendency for courts, particularly <b>the</b> Family Court <b>of</b> Australia, to undermine particular legislative goals. The tensions between <b>the</b> aims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Family Law Act and traditional legal processes were doubtless in part responsible for that state of affairs and, as will be seen, tensions continue to exist between legislators, policymakers and courts. It would be struthious indeed for any commentator to attempt to gloss over these difficulties and the uncertainties to which these forces have given - and continue to give - rise. The thesis which this commentary seeks to pursue is that, since the 1975 Act came into force at least, the pressures to which the law and its administrators have been subjected have led to a state of uncertainty about both the present and the future. Put another way, neither the legislators nor the administrators seem to be aware <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> other wants or, indeed, is likely to do...|$|R

40|$|Who {{should the}} state punish? Why? Should {{punishment}} be proportional? This article surveys, in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> these fundamental criminal-law questions, the Second Amendment’s constitutional history and jurisprudence. A vast body <b>of</b> {{evidence shows that}} <b>the</b> <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Second and Fourteenth Amendments intended to protect the individual’s {{right to keep and}} carry arms for protection against both governmental and private aggression. Yet courts, unwilling to allow disfavored groups <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> self-defense, or fearing being blamed for criminal firearm activity, have failed to enforce {{the right to bear arms}} to any meaningful extent. After the Civil War, the U. S. Supreme Court read portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution. In the twentieth century, despite <b>the</b> Court’s rejection <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> proposition that the Second Amendment right belonged only to states and the proposition that government had plenary power to limit arms possession, lower courts refused to enforce any limit on governmental power over the right to keep and bear arms. After District of Columbia v. Heller declared with no lack <b>of</b> clarity that <b>the</b> Second Amendment protected an individual arms right, lower courts nonetheless continue flagrantly to defy the Supreme Court’s mandate. This judicial abdication has allowed the continued legislative overcriminalization of entirely peaceable citizens that the state has no reason to have on its radar. <b>The</b> vast majority <b>of</b> gun laws are malum prohibitum possessory offenses that often provide greater penalties than heinous malum in se offenses. This legislative overreach and judicial underenforcement has been enabled by <b>the</b> systematic demonization <b>of</b> both gun owners and certain types of firearms.

25|$|Rep. John Bingham, <b>the</b> {{principal}} <b>framer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment, advocated {{that the}} Fourteenth applied {{the first eight}} Amendments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights to <b>the</b> States. The U.S. Supreme Court subsequently declined to interpret it that way, despite the dissenting argument in <b>the</b> 1947 case <b>of</b> Adamson v. California by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black that the framers' intent should control <b>the</b> Court's interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment (he included a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham's congressional testimony). Although the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black's interpretation, the Court during the following twenty-five years employed a doctrine of selective incorporation that succeeded in extending to the States almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protections in <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights, as well as other, unenumerated rights. <b>The</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights thus imposes legal limits on <b>the</b> powers <b>of</b> governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights. The Supreme Court for example concluded in the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) case that the founders intended <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. As the Court noted <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights “was to withdraw certain subjects from <b>the</b> vicissitudes <b>of</b> political controversy, to place them beyond <b>the</b> reach <b>of</b> majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” This is why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> no elections.” <b>The</b> 14th Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|R

25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not.

Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution.

If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E
40|$|In {{supporting}} <b>the</b> invocation <b>of</b> {{stare decisis}} in constitutional cases, the Supreme Court has maintained that its decisions affect {{how the people}} conceptualize the government and their rights.

40|$|One {{enduring}} historical debate concerns {{whether the}} American Constitution {{was intended to}} be 2 ̆ 2 classical 2 ̆ 2 [...] referring to a theory of statecraft that maximizes <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> private markets and minimizes <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> government in economic affairs. The most central and powerful proposition of classical constitutionalism is that the government 2 ̆ 7 s role in economic development should be minimal. First, private rights in property and contract exist prior to any community needs for development. Second, if a particular project is worthwhile the market itself will make it occur. Third, when the government attempts to induce development politics inevitably distorts the decision making. The result is excessive state involvement, with benefits typically going to well placed interest groups. From the Colonial period until the mid-nineteenth century American legislatures and courts conceived <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patent as an active tool of economic growth. States in particular granted patents in anticipation that the grantee would actually develop some work of public improvement. This conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patent was distinctly 2 ̆ 2 pre-classical 2 ̆ 2 {{in the sense that it}} envisioned considerable state involvement in ensuring that granted patents were put to appropriate use. In addition, state issued patents, although not federal patents, were issued to 2 ̆ 2 promoters 2 ̆ 2 [...] that is, to those who did not really claim to have invented anything new, but rather promised to develop technology or infrastructure in a new place. A few decades later a much more classical conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patent emerged, as a property right pure and simple. Questions about whether and how to employ a patent were lodged almost entirely with its owner, who at <b>the</b> high point <b>of</b> patent classicism even had the power to use patents to keep technology off the market [...] precisely contrary to what <b>the</b> original <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provision had in mind. An essential part of this development was <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> federal patent exclusivity [...] a result that was not mandated by <b>the</b> text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s IP Clause, particularly when read against the Tenth Amendment. <b>The</b> sources <b>of</b> increased hostility toward state issued patents were twofold. First was the view that state issued patents burdened interstate commerce. For example, the Supreme Court struck down the state-issued steamboat patent under the Commerce Clause, not under the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s IP Clause. Second, however, only federal exclusivity could effectively limit <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states to grant unwarranted exclusive rights to favored grantees. The eventual result was a regime in which Congress acquired the exclusive power to award patents for inventions. Changes in United States patent law under the 1836 Patent Act and later were driven by classical beliefs that monopoly is bad and generally unnecessary for economic development, with invention as a narrow exception. This entailed, first, that the conditions for obtaining a patent be narrow, limited to actual inventions within the applicant 2 ̆ 7 s possession, and adequately disclosed. Second, patent issuance had to be made a nonpolitical, administrative action. The applicant was entitled to a patent if he could make specific showings concerning prior technology and use. The 2 ̆ 2 prior art 2 ̆ 2 queries that increasingly dominated patentability doctrine focused on what had been available in the past, rather than what economic development might require for the future. Finally, once a patent was issued the government very largely abandoned its interest. The patent entered commerce as personal property, creating individual rights but few social obligations. Together these requirements led both Congress and the courts away from relatively open ended policy concerns, and toward technical specification and boundary clarity. The result was a patent system increasingly detached from questions about economic development...|$|R
