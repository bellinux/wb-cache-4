40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{derivation}} of the American jury system from the English jury of Henry II. To this end, <b>a</b> short history <b>of</b> English law {{and the history of}} the development of the English jury is given. The method of the English jury's development is used to show the evolution of the early American jury into the American jury of today. The American jury still resembles the English jury from which it evolved. The American system has a grand jury to indict criminals and a petit jury to try the case. The practice <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> was begun by the English jurors and is still in practice in American today as well as the challenging of potential jurors for bias. The American system differs from the juries of old in its inability to determine matters of law and in its move away from unanimity in verdicts and the twelve-man jury. Some of the aspects of the historical English jury are still in use in the American jury system of today, but some differences have been created through case law and legislation. It will come to no surprise, however, that the most important characteristics of the historical English jury are still present in the American system today. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
2500|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{covenants}} in the Hebrew Bible, including the obligatory type and the promissory type. The obligatory covenant is more common with the Hittite peoples, and deals with the relationship between two parties of equal standing. In contrast, the promissory type of covenant {{is seen in the}} Abrahamic and Davidic covenants. Promissory covenants focus on the relationship between the suzerain and the vassal and are similar to the [...] "royal grant" [...] type of legal document, which include historical introduction, border delineations, stipulations, witnesses, blessings, and curses. In royal grants, the master could reward a servant for being loyal. God rewarded Abraham, Noah, and David in his covenants with them. <b>As</b> part <b>of</b> his covenant with Abraham, God has the obligation to keep Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people and be their God. When taking this oath we see that God is accompanied by a smoking oven and a torch. [...] These were objects used in the procedure <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> much like oaths that involved sacrificing animals while taking the oath. God acts as the suzerain power and is the party of the covenant accompanied by the required action that comes with the oath whether it be fire or animals in the sacrificial oaths.

40|$|The ritual <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> upon {{graduating from}} medical school is, {{with a few}} exceptions, a routine {{requirement}} for graduation. Albeit that many students {{believe that they have}} taken the Hippocratic Oath, this is virtually never the case. Very often students themselves write many of these oaths, and taking such <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> impresses the student as well as the public, who are potential patients. It sketches the ethically proper way for physicians to treat their patients. Such <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> is meaningful only when it is not coerced but in reality sketches the physicians' obligations toward patients, society, and each other. The question and problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coerced <b>oath</b> are discussed. It is concluded that students when first entering medical school know that such <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> will be <b>a</b> requirement for graduation, and because much of the time the persons taking the oath are writing it, I believe that coercion is not a factor. It is an unfortunate fact that throughout the nation students who are known to behave in ethically inappropriate ways are nevertheless allowed to graduate. Possible ways of addressing this troubling situation are discussed. Equally troublesome {{is the fact that we}} who administer the oath as well as the students who swear to it are aware that the system of medical care makes it extremely difficult and at times impossible to truly adhere to the full implications of this oath. According to the oath, physicians (in virtually all formulations) swear that social standing (and by implication economic factors) will not change the way in which patients are treated. This becomes impossible when uninsured patients are sent away at the front desk long before the physician can interact with them. Furthermore, the current fact that physicians often are confronted with not doing what they consider a necessary test (or prescribe what they think would be the best medication) raises the problem of either lying or suggesting to the patient that he/she do so – a fact that in the long run cannot help but damage the physician's veracity and the trust which patients put in their physicians. That virtually all codes of the American Medical Association (AMA) as well as the various specialties insist that physicians work toward universal access is stressed...|$|R
40|$|In Roma {{settlements}} {{of western}} Slovakia one can still {{come across the}} ritual <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> before the cross.

60|$|All {{this took}} place at the time when The Book of Common Prayer, having been said to {{occasion}} 'manifold inconveniency,' was, by <b>an</b> Act <b>of</b> Parliament, 'abolished,'[51] and by a subsequent Act[52] prohibited, under severe penalties, from being publicly used. The 'manifold inconveniences' to which the Act refers, arose from differences of opinion as to the propriety of the form which had been enforced, heightened by the enormous cruelties practiced upon multitudes who refused to use it. Opposition to the English Liturgy as more combined in Scotland, by a covenant entered into, June 20, 1580, by the king, lords, nobles, and people, against Popery; and upon Archbishop Laud's attempt, in 1637, to impose the service-book upon our northern neighbours, tumults and bloodshed ensued; until, in 1643, a new and very solemn league and covenant was entered into, which, in 1645, extended its influence to England, being subscribed by thousands of our best citizens, with many of the nobility--'wherein we all subscribe, and each with his own hands lifted up to the Most High God, doe swear'; that being the mode <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath,</b> instead <b>of</b> kissing the cover <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book, as is now practiced. To the cruel and intemperate measures of Laud, and the zeal of Charles, for priestly domination over conscience, may be justly attributed the wars which desolated the country, while the solemn league and covenant brought an overwhelming force to aid the Parliament in redressing the grievances of the kingdom. During the Commonwealth there was substituted, in place of the Common Prayer, A directory for the Publique Worship of God, and the uniformity which was enjoined in it was like that of the Presbyterians and Dissenters of the present day. The people having assembled, and been exhorted to reverence and humility, joined the preacher in prayer. He then read portions of Scripture, with or without an exposition, as he judged it necessary, but not so as to render the service tedious. After singing a psalm, the minister prayed, leading the people to mourn under <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> sin, and to hunger and thirst after the grace of God, in Jesus Christ; an outline or abstract is given of the subject of public prayer, and similar instructions are given as to the sermon or paraphrase. Immediately after the sermon, prayer was again offered up, and after the outline that is given of this devotional exercise, it is noted, 'And because the prayer which Christ taught his disciples, is not only <b>a</b> pattern <b>of</b> prayer, but itself a most comprehensive prayer, we recommend it also {{to be used in the}} prayers of the Church.' This being ended, a psalm was sung, and the minister dismissed the congregation with a solemn blessing.[53] Some of the clergy continued the use of prayers, contained in the liturgy, reciting, instead of reading them--a course that was not objected to. This was the form of service which struck Bunyan with such awe and reverence, leaving a very solemn impression upon his mind, which the old form of common prayer had never produced.|$|R
