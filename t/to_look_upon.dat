5|$|Virgin, {{whom the}} {{messenger}} salutes in angelic speech, {{you were born}} without stain: I ask that you implore him – who, born from the conception of celestial seed holds the mysterious command as triunal deity – to forgive me my sins, that he may deign to grant longlasting joys through his own eternity and <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> me with {{the sight of his}} holy vision.|$|E
5|$|The film also touches upon Hollywood's {{perceived}} {{mistreatment of}} women. While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize {{their ability to}} act, the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently {{and listen to the}} male filmmakers. Her only role is to be an object for men <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon.</b> The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea of a {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E

25|$|We prefer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> {{science and}} {{religion}} as separate domains which need not be in serious conflict and, therefore, need no reconciliation. If we seek the blending of {{science and religion}} and the integration of secular knowledge with sacred wisdom, then {{it is not in}} the subject matter of these fields but rather within the personality of the individual that we hope to achieve the synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Nazi Germany, however, had no plan {{or desire}} to restore {{autonomy}} to Latvia, {{even though they}} ordered Colonel Alexander Plesners to oversee formation of the Latvian Defence Forces. On July 8, the Germans announced that wearing of non-German uniforms was banned. Also, rebel units were ordered to disarm. Jewish fears of the Nazis—which had led some <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> the Soviet occupation {{as a measure of}} security—were to prove tragically well founded.|$|E

25|$|Most {{contemporary}} {{scholars of}} antiquity agree that Jesus existed, and most biblical scholars and classical historians see {{the theories of}} his nonexistence as effectively refuted. There {{is no indication that}} writers in antiquity who opposed Christianity questioned the existence of Jesus. However, there is widespread disagreement among scholars on the details of the life of Jesus mentioned in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings. Scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the biblical accounts of Jesus, and historians tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> supernatural or miraculous claims about Jesus as questions of faith, rather than historical fact.|$|E
25|$|By 1790, the anticlerical Terror {{phase of}} the French Revolution forced many loyal priests {{to hide from the}} regime in order to carry out the sacraments in their parish. Even though to do so had been {{declared}} illegal, the Vianneys traveled to distant farms to attend Masses celebrated by priests on the run. Realizing that such priests risked their lives day by day, Vianney began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> them as heroes. He received his First Communion catechism instructions in a private home by two nuns whose communities had been dissolved during the Revolution. He made his first communion at the age of 13. During the Mass, the windows were covered so that the light of the candles could not be seen from the outside. His practice of the Faith continued in secret, especially during his preparation for confirmation.|$|E

500|$|Harmony of Dissonance {{takes place}} in 1748, fifty years after Simon Belmont ended Dracula's curse. As result of his battle against Dracula was that the villagers changed their opinion of him and the Belmont family. Producer Koji Igarashi explained: [...] "Simon was {{regarded}} as a life-saver, and people started <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> him as a hero; little by little, the people started to gather around them. A village, therefore, was formed around Belmonts. Juste Belmont grew up in this environment with his childhood friends Maxim Kischine and Lydie Erlanger." ...|$|E
500|$|The Defence Minister Rafael Urdaneta, who {{had served}} {{alongside}} MacGregor during the Aux Cayes expedition of 1816, asked the Senate <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> the Scotsman's application favourably as he had [...] "enlisted in our ranks {{from the very start}} of the War of Independence, and ran the same risks as all the patriots of that disastrous time, meriting promotions and respect because of his excellent personal conduct"—MacGregor's contributions had been [...] "heroic with immense results". President José Antonio Páez, another former revolutionary comrade, approved the application in March 1839.|$|E
500|$|When {{considering}} the theological {{meaning of the}} event, some authors have interpreted the darkness as a period of mourning by the cosmos itself at the death of Jesus. Others have seen {{it as a sign}} of God's judgement on the Jewish people, sometimes connecting it with the destruction of the city of Jerusalem in the year 70; or as symbolising shame, fear, or the mental suffering of Jesus. Fitzmyer compares the event to a contemporary description recorded in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which recounts [...] "unlawful acts against the gods, from which we believe the very sun turned away, as if it too were loath <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> the foul deed".|$|E
