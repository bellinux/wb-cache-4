5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding the base of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and,</b> especially in the male, large white patches on the wings.

In the male, there is a wattle on <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E

5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926.

He also notes a row of pits suggesting {{the place of the}} spine. He concludes that the Giant {{is very different from the}} Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to modelling the microstructure of snow is presented. The features involved in this formulation include skeletonising of the granular material and the modelling of <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> as a system of truncated cones. The skeletonising involves the process of representing the granular structure {{by a series of}} lines describing <b>the</b> grains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> <b>and</b> bonds. <b>The</b> value associated with any point on the skeleton is determined by the closest distance from the point to a grain boundary or neck boundary, whichever is smaller. This approach allows for easy visualisation of the material and efficient data storage. The use truncated cone model for the necked regions represents a more accurate physical description of <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> <b>and</b> should provide for a better relationship between microstructure and material properties.

5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E

5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> that it covered the base of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and {{pointed out that the}} cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a {{condition}} where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> {{at the base of}} the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both front and rear legs. Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is no genetic test for OAAM, and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present.|$|E
5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' on the arm, presumably a tattoo or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which was worn around <b>the</b> <b>neck)</b> <b>and</b> a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. A law of 375 required those with superior fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses. In the 4th century, the minimum length of service was 20 years (24 years in some limitanei units). This compares with 25 years in both legions and auxilia during the Principate.|$|E
