25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain {{about it is that}} one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 2007, LeMond {{rode the}} L'Étape du Tour cyclosportive with his son, {{and found it}} to be a {{defining}} moment in his post-competition life. [...] "I had the time of my life", he said, despite getting [...] "650th place" [...] and being [...] "impressed that I even finished". LeMond continued, [...] "I decided that day that nobody's going <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody." [...] At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called and threatened to disclose publicly that LeMond was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, should he appear in court as scheduled the following day. Undeterred, LeMond took the stand and testified, before admitting to the world that he had been molested.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't care to hear," [...] said Kenton. [...] "All I {{want is for}} him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> away <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> I {{think if}} he spoke to me I should kill him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; I {{want her}} to soften and help me. She seems to draw and smooth away the evil, and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> myself. Nothing is so dreary where she is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> running away. I always {{threatened}} that. Mostly, though, {{because the}} men got drunk at the villages. But {{they were always}} good to me. I wasn't afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, ah-huh!" [...] replied Lenore, imitating her father, and bantering Jake, {{more for}} the fun of it than from any {{intention}} of disobeying him. [...] "Who's going <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> it?" ...|$|E
60|$|From the {{opposite}} side there was another man aiming for the same place, but he ran and got there first. It was Case; doubtless his idea was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> apart <b>from</b> the missionary, who might serve me as interpreter; but my mind was upon other things. I was thinking how he had jockeyed us about the marriage, and tried his hand on Uma before, and {{at the sight of}} him rage flew into my nostrils.|$|R
50|$|Little Pipö was {{not only}} my last family link to the past. She was also the {{organizer}} of the day-to-day details of my life, the sharer of my innermost feelings. She knew with an uncanny instinct when <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> free <b>from</b> interruption when I was immersed in scientific work, and when to open the gate to entertainment and gaiety. I never realized until she was gone how close we were {{to each other and}} how much I depended on her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stranger to me," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "than {{even your}} story is her being able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> I {{believed}} no thought ever crossed her {{mind that she}} did not let me share." ...|$|R
60|$|It was all I {{cared to}} know. There was naught <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> that balcony now, {{and with a}} long, running leap I sprang far aloft until my hands grasped its lowest sill.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the light}} was extinguished, [...] She covered me warm, [...] And she prayed to the angels [...] <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> harm-- [...] To {{the queen of the}} angels [...] To shield me from harm.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{more than}} being {{restored}} to this life--I {{feel that it is}} the beginning of eternal life. It is the Savior who sought me out, and I know that he is able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> falling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Brace," [...] Mr. Wright said, in a {{friendly}} tone: [...] "I called you in here to have a confidential chat upon the subject, {{and it is not}} right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> anything which may have a bearing on the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Violently.] Well, {{living with}} you is enough to drive anyone off their nut. Your bunk about the farm being so fine! Didn't I write you year after year how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made of me? What'd you care? Nothing! Not even enough {{to come out and}} see me! That crazy bull about wanting <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> away <b>from</b> the sea don't go down with me! You yust didn't want to be bothered with me! You're like all the rest of 'em! ...|$|R
6000|$|Beneath my ban that mystic man Shall suffer, coute qui coute, MATILDA! What {{right has}} he <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> The Admiralty route, MATILDA? Because, forsooth!

6000|$|... 'He {{commanded}} {{me to see}} him,' said Philammon, {{with the}} true soldierlike discipline of a monk; 'and see him I will in spite of any man. I believe in my heart you wish <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> his counsels and his blessing.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{never did}} vague {{conjecture}} or fruitless fears {{for the future}} lie with sufficient weight upon my mind <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> my rest, and so tonight I threw myself upon my sleeping silks and furs and passed at once into dreamless slumber.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honest, Maw, I ain't a-lyin'," [...] insisted Willie. [...] "Wot do {{you suppose}} he give me this fer, if it wasn't <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> talkin'," [...] and the boy drew a {{crumpled}} one dollar bill from his pocket. It was worth the dollar to escape a thrashing.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could recall}} no more the {{hallucination}} of the Eastern Archipelago which I certainly hoped to see again. The story of [...] "Almayer's Folly" [...] got put away under the pillow for that day. I {{do not know}} that I had any occupation <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> away <b>from</b> it; {{the truth of the matter}} is that on board that ship we were leading just then a contemplative life. I will not say anything of my privileged position. I was there [...] "just to oblige," [...] as an actor of standing may take a small part in the benefit performance of a friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{ran away}} <b>from</b> <b>me</b> some time ago," [...] he went on, [...] "sick {{to death of}} me she was. She thought she'd got all my money. She hadn't. There's plenty more, plenty more. She ran away and left me with Mathers. She was paying him so much a week <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> quiet, not <b>to</b> let me go {{anywhere}} where I should talk, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> away <b>from</b> her {{so that she could}} live up here and see all her friends and spend my money. And at first I didn't mind, and then I did mind, and I got angry with Mathers, and Mathers wouldn't let me come away, and three nights ago I killed Mathers." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{started writing}} about my {{childhood}} baseball cards {{a little over}} a decade ago out of desperation. I didn 2 ̆ 7 t have a job, any my money was running out, and the novel I purported to be working on was dying of pretentiousness and exhaustion. Writing about baseball cards didn 2 ̆ 7 t solve any of those problems. But there was some life in it, at least. Over the years it has grown into a practice of sorts, or maybe it 2 ̆ 7 s a hobby, like building ships in bottles, who knows, but either way it seems <b>to</b> help <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> completely unraveling...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{take from}} {{you what you}} never had. Stand there and hear me. No; I will have no blandishments <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> my purpose, no soft words to silence the hard ones I mean to speak, no more illusions to hide us {{from each other and}} ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some day {{you shall}} {{come out and}} see us perform, that's all,' said Lucilla, merrily. 'But indeed, Owen, if I know myself at all, unmerited affection and forbearance, with no {{nonsense}} about it, {{is the only way}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> flying out. At any rate, I can't live without it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not getting}} on, mother," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{scattering}} myself. I'm getting no grip. I {{want to get}} a better hold upon life, or else I do not see what is <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> going to pieces--and wasting existence. It's rather difficult sometimes to tell what one thinks and feels--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Elmore {{laughed in}} turn. [...] "Why, so it is; so it is! That {{accounts}} {{for everything that}} puzzled me. I don't wonder my maunderings amused you. It was ridiculous, to be sure! When {{in the world did}} she give him the sittings, and how did you manage <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it <b>from</b> <b>me</b> so well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And why?" [...] {{said the}} Chemist; {{not with the}} least {{expression}} of interest, but with a moody, wayward kind of curiosity. [...] "Why? How comes it that you have sought <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> especially <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> the knowledge of your remaining here, at this season, when all the rest have dispersed, and of your being ill? I {{want to know why}} this is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by looking like that, all of you?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What does it matter? He was only my man-servant. I am Wenham Gardner, millionaire. No one will put me in prison for that. Besides, he shouldn't have tried <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> away <b>from</b> my wife. Anyway, it don't matter. I am quite mad. Mad people can do what they like. They have to stop in an asylum for six months, and then they're quite cured and they start again. I don't mind being mad for six months. Elizabeth," [...] he whined, [...] "come and be mad, too. You haven't been kind to me. There's plenty more money--plenty more. Come back for a little time and I'll show you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{want to do}} things. I want to work," [...] cried Dora; [...] "it {{would be}} cruel <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the fun of helping you get supper. Haven't you {{something}} I can slip on instead of this dress? It is not very fine, but I don't want to spatter or burn it." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{work and}} Forsythe's comradeship {{helped me to}} bear the tedium of my work in the country. No Saturday was too stormy, and the roads were never too deep with snow <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> my weekly visit to Morris where I {{came in contact with}} people nearer to my ways of {{thinking}} and living.|$|E
60|$|I had a {{great deal}} of {{satisfaction}} in William's discourse, and it quieted me very much; but William was very anxious ever after about my talking in my sleep, and took care to lie with me always himself, and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> lodging in any house where so much as a word of English was understood.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know but}} that you have done well <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> At all events it has not--cannot, and should not alter my opinion toward M'liss. You will of course keep it a secret. In the mean time you must not blame me if I cling to my {{instincts}} in preference to your judgment. I still believe that you are mistaken in regard to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, legally {{it is my}} own. I know that. And {{when there}} was some {{question}} whether {{it should not be}} disputed, I would have fought for it to the last shilling. Somebody--I suppose it was the lawyer--wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> the place in Surrey. I told them that then I would not abandon my right to an inch of it. But they yielded, and now I have given them back the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I came in here," [...] he said, [...] "I {{wished to}} be certain of one thing. Your {{prevarication}} has told me what I wanted to know. The newspapers had Catherine's own authority for it, Mrs. Presty, when they called her widow. I know now why my brother, who never deceived me before, has deceived me about this. I understand the part that your daughter has been playing--and I am as certain as if I had heard it, of the devilish lie that one of you--perhaps both of you--must have told my poor child. No, no; I had better not see Catherine. Many a man has killed his wife, and has not had such good reason for doing it as I have. You are quite right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> away <b>from</b> her." ...|$|R
