500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy said [...] " [...] 'What's My Name?' is {{essentially}} the long, luxuriant lovemaking session to 'Rude Boy's hard'n'fast rut... it manages to stay classy even when Drake makes a dodgy joke about the 'square root of 69' and Rihanna delivers a not-so-coy reference to oral sex." [...] Megan Vick from Billboard said [...] "As much as 'What's My Name' is a joint effort, Rihanna owns the song by delivering a more polished version of her pop persona." [...] According to Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone {{with the release of}} [...] "What's My Name?" [...] as second single from the album Rihanna created [...] "a perfect little tropical storm". He continued: [...] " [...] Over dark, humid synths and swirling snare skitters, she's in full-on Caribbean-queen mode, dialing up her islander accent and rolling out a <b>to-do</b> <b>list</b> for any adult male seeking entrance into her chambers". However, he also criticized Drake's [...] "Square root of 69" [...] line, stating that Drake sounds like a nerdy guy from a fraternity while he raps it.|$|E
500|$|... {{the latest}} update was version 0.43.05, with it {{completing}} 14 years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams {{and his brother}} have a <b>to-do</b> <b>list</b> of features the game should have before version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. He {{says he has been}} able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to different aspects of the game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting his own bed. The other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years.|$|E

However, the United States, China and India could not agree on the threshold that would allow the mechanism to be used, with the United States arguing that the threshold had been set too low.|$|E

Following the release of Lion the previous year, {{it was the first}} of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a <b>to-do</b> <b>list</b> app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud. Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen.

[...] The Daily Mail's Jaci Stephen stated [...] "When Sonya tells Toadie that the wedding will all go smoothly, {{you just know}} that there is disaster in store – and, sure enough, when a gas canister is knocked over, there's a huge explosion that results in the death of two key characters." [...] A Daily Post reporter quipped [...] "No wedding goes without a hitch in soapland, and Toadie and Sonya's is no exception." [...] On the day the episode was broadcast in the UK, All About Soaps Claire Crick wrote [...] "There's just one thing you need to have {{at the top of your}} <b>to-do</b> <b>list</b> today… and that's watch Neighbours! The day of the explosion has finally arrived and the episode will be epic from start to finish – we promise!" [...] Digital Spy ran a poll asking readers whether Channel 5 should put Neighbours in the prime time slot again and 89.12% believed that it would be a good idea.|$|E

40|$|Personal {{tasks are}} managed {{with a variety}} of {{mechanisms}} from <b>To-Do</b> <b>lists</b> to calendars to emails. Task management remains challenging, since many tasks are interrelated, some may depend on other people’s tasks to be accomplished, and their priority and status changes over time.
