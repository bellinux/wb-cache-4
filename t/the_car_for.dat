5|$|Vision Racing {{was unable}} to secure {{sponsorship}} to run a second car in 2009, leaving Foyt out of a ride. He returned to A. J. Foyt Enterprises for the 93rd Indianapolis 500, driving the #41 ABC Supply entry for his grandfather, A. J. Foyt. Foyt finished 16th on the lead lap as his teammate Vitor Meira was injured in a late-race crash. Paul Tracy was drafted as the substitute driver for Meira at the next race, but Foyt stepped into <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>for</b> his home race at Texas Motor Speedway. Ryan Hunter-Reay drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} season and Texas would be Foyt's last race of 2009.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>for</b> him. He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity at Indianapolis.|$|E

25|$|With {{the first}} of the new {{commuter}} cars in service on the Burlington the next railroad that approached Budd to design of new type of car with a greater seating capacity while also improving the accommodations for coach passengers was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The Santa Fe was searching for a better design for its long distance passenger trains and, with the design of the Burlington coaches in mind Budd set out to create a similar passenger car design to meet the Santa Fe's needs. In September 1952 the Santa Fe placed an order for two two-level prototypes, Budd's Lot 9679-129. The two coaches carrying the numbers 526 and 527 were delivered in July 1954, at which time both were placed into service for evaluation. These two prototypes had seating on the both levels, stairs on one end to provide access to single-level cars, a stairway at the center of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>for</b> access to toilets on the lower level, as well as the door in the side of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>for</b> embarking and departing passengers.
