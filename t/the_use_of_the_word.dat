5|$|One of {{the main}} issues during the {{election}} was the ban of <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'Allah' in Christian publications. However, the Sarawak police has banned political parties from using the issue during campaigning in the by-election as it was deemed to be a sensitive issue. Sarawak's Officer in Charge of Criminal Investigations, Huzir Mohamed, threatened to prosecute offenders of the ban under the Sedition Act or the Internal Security Act (ISA).|$|E
5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} French word kilo, a {{shortening}} of kilogramme, was imported into the English language {{where it has}} been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While kilo is acceptable in many generalist texts, for example The Economist, its use is typically considered inappropriate in certain applications including scientific, technical and legal writing, where authors should adhere strictly to SI nomenclature. When the United States Congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kilo {{as an alternative to the}} word kilogram, but in 1990 revoked the status of the word kilo.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{electricity}} and <b>the</b> claim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon being non-lethal, controversy has sprouted over particular incidents involving <b>the</b> weapon and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon in general. In essence, controversy has been centered on <b>the</b> justification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon in certain instances, and, in some cases, health {{issues that are}} claimed {{to be due to}} <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon.|$|R

50|$|For example, {{freeform}} negotiation {{is merely}} <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tools without any process. Negotiation within a labor arbitration setting is <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tools within a highly formalized and controlled setting.|$|R

25|$|Custom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barred helmet {{was also}} {{followed}} by city patricians. Although <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tilting helmet by burghers {{was not always}} obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German-Nordic heraldic tradition, e.g. in Swedish heraldry.|$|R

25|$|In modern Hebrew and Yiddish {{the word}} goy is the {{standard}} term for a gentile. In English, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> goy can be controversial. It is sometimes used pejoratively {{to refer to a}} non-Jew, but many see it as no more insulting than the term gentile.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{alloantigen}} actually masks {{the fact}} that HLA are infrequently autoantigens in the donor, and therefore their function is not as antigens, but something else. But the naming of these antigens is not borne out of function but the need to match organ donors with recipients.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used robot configurations are articulated robots, SCARA robots, delta robots and cartesian coordinate robots, (gantry robots or x-y-z robots). In the context of general robotics, most types of robots would fall {{into the category of}} robotic arms (inherent in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> manipulator in ISO standard 1738).|$|E

50|$|According to Strawson, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term {{apartheid}} {{to describe}} Israel or Israeli policies has become commonplace in certain liberal and leftist circles. Strawson wrote that this label {{does not apply}} to Israel, and suggests that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartheid analogy is casual, unhistorical, and unhelpful.|$|R
25|$|Early in {{his tenure}} as Chief of Police, Daryl Gates re-instituted <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choke hold (placing an arm or {{flashlight}} over someone's throat) in order to subdue suspects. In 1982, this technique was used and lead to <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> a suspect James Mincey Jr. Following Mincey's death, the Police Commission barred <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chokehold by officers unless {{it was in a}} life-threatening situation. An investigation into <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choke hold found that sixteen people had died after being restrained by police choke holds.|$|R
25|$|The words homophile and {{homophilia}} are dated {{terms for}} homosexuality. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> began to disappear {{with the emergence}} of the gay liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, replaced by a new set of terminology which provides a much clearer identity such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender.|$|E
25|$|In Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, Hakka {{people are}} {{sometimes}} known as Khek, from the Hokkien (Southern Min) pronunciation kheh of 客 (Hakka: hak). However, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'Khek' is limited mainly to {{areas where the}} local Chinese population is mainly of Hokkien origin. In places where other Chinese subgroups predominate, the term 'Hakka' is still the more commonly used.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} from Whorf's {{experience}} as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector. While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels {{and one for the}} empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> empty in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg as not actually demonstrating causality between <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> empty and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of circular reasoning. Pinker in The Language Instinct ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.|$|E
50|$|Educational sloyd {{as practiced}} in Sweden started with <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife. The knife was {{controversial}} when sloyd {{was first introduced}} in the UK. Educators in London and <b>the</b> other cities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK could hardly imagine putting knives in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> juveniles. They developed a rationale for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> chisels instead. Salomon's purpose in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife was that it illustrates a fundamental premise. During <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> sloyd’s invention and introduction in rural Sweden, nearly every boy growing {{up on a farm}} was already experienced in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife and knew how to use it without endangering himself or others. Starting with the known and moving toward the unknown was a crucial element of Salomon’s theory. He also believed that beauty of form was more readily available through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife.|$|R

25|$|Mahatma Gandhi {{coined the}} word Harijan, {{translated}} roughly as people of God, to identify untouchables in 1933. The name was disliked by Ambedkar as it emphasised the Dalits {{as belonging to}} the Greater Hindu Nation rather than being an independent community like Muslims.. When untouchability was outlawed after Indian independence, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Harijan to describe the ex-untouchables was more common among other castes than the Dalits themselves.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{this element}} is {{expressed}} as {{the intent to}} commit a felony “therein”. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> “therein” adds nothing and certainly does not limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises. The situs of the felony does not matter, and burglary occurs if the wrongdoer intended to commit a felony {{at the time he}} broke and entered.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of Asian American has variations {{that derive from}} <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> American in different contexts. Immigration status, citizenship (by birthright and by naturalization), acculturation, and language ability are some variables {{that are used to}} define American for various purposes and may vary in formal and everyday usage. For example, restricting American to include only U.S. citizens conflicts with discussions of Asian American businesses, which generally refer both to citizen and non-citizen owners.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kurta, {{people in}} Jammu {{traditionally}} wore the peshwaj which flowed to the ankles. However, the traditional attire {{now is the}} kurta and Dogri pajjamma. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kurta was very rare in Kashmir until Kashyap Bandhu encouraged its <b>use</b> in <b>the</b> 1930s cultural revolution.|$|R
50|$|All {{these firms}} bear in common <b>the</b> <b>using</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bontems type going-barrel {{movement}} contained inside generally fine, beautifully crafted cases in various materials which incorporated, with relative frequency, a timepiece during the interwar period (1920s and 1930s). They are distinguished by favouring <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guilloché enamel technique too.|$|R
5|$|The Committee's mandate did {{not include}} <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bomb—its <b>use</b> upon {{completion}} was presumed. Following a protest by scientists involved in the project, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Franck Report, <b>the</b> Committee re-examined <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bomb. In a June 21 meeting, it reaffirmed {{that there was no}} alternative.|$|R
25|$|Though {{historian}} Paul Bartrop rejects <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> genocide {{to describe}} Australian colonial history in general, he does {{believe that it}} applies to describing the Stolen Generations. Bartrop and US scholar Samuel Totten together wrote the Dictionary of Genocide, for which Bartrop wrote the entry on Australia. He said he used as the benchmark for usage of the term genocide the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which had also been cited by Wilson in his 1997 Bringing Them Home report.|$|E
25|$|West Indian bowler, Michael Holding {{recalled}} how the comment “Smacked {{of racism and}} Apartheid. He got our backs up and made us more determined.” Greig claimed the word grovel was used only {{as a response to}} the way the interviewer had been discrediting the England team as major underdogs in the match-up. When asked about the remark prior to the first test, the West Indian captain Clive Lloyd gave Greig the benefit of the doubt surrounding <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> grovel. Lloyd however declared being furious about how Greig had patronizingly characterized the West Indies team as unprofessional and nonchalant Calypso cricketers.|$|E
25|$|In Norwegian tradition, similar tales may be {{told about}} the larger trolls and the Huldrefolk ("hidden-folk") yet a {{distinction}} is made between the two. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> trow in Orkney and Shetland, to mean beings which are very like the Huldrefolk in Norway may suggest a common origin for the terms. The word troll {{may have been used}} by pagan Norse settlers in Orkney and Shetland as a collective term for supernatural beings who should be respected and avoided rather than worshiped. Troll could later have become specialized as a description of the larger, more menacing Jötunn-kind whereas Huldrefolk may have developed as the term for smaller trolls.|$|E
