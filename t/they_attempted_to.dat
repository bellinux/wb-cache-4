5|$|On 26 January 945, however, at {{the urging}} of their sister, the Augusta Helena, another coup removed the two Lekapenoi from power under the {{accusation}} that <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> poison Constantine VII, and restored the sole imperial authority to the latter.|$|E
5|$|After {{two months}} at sea, land was sighted on November 9 {{off the coast}} of Cape Cod. <b>They</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> sail south to the {{designated}} landing site {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson but ran into trouble in the region of Pollack Rip, a shallow area of shoals between Cape Cod and Nantucket Island. With winter approaching and provisions running dangerously low, the passengers decided to return north to Cape Cod Bay and abandon their original landing plans.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, several tribes, {{including}} the Shawnee, migrated into Indiana, where <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> resettle in land belonging to the Miami. The Iroquois gained the military advantage after they were supplied with firearms by the Europeans. With their superior weapons, the Iroquois subjugated at least thirty tribes and nearly destroyed several others in northern Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Dean's small force {{eventually}} {{made it out}} of the city past several North Korean roadblocks. Just outside the city Dean stopped his jeep to tend to several wounded US soldiers in a wrecked truck in the ditch. However, as <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> escape further they ran into another North Korean roadblock and were forced to continue on foot, crossing the Taejon River and climbing a nearby mountain. In the confusion, Dean was separated from the group.|$|E
5|$|In October 1166, Becket ordered Robert and Roger of Worcester {{to attend}} him in France, {{so they could}} give him {{guidance}} on his dispute with the king. When they informed the king of their intended journey he forbade them to leave England. Nevertheless, <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> sneak {{out of the country}} in February 1167. They were apprehended on 2February, and ordered to remain in England not only in the king's name, but also in Alexander's.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo {{collapsed}} in a hallway of her St. Petersburg, Florida apartment. Firefighters and paramedics, arriving in response to her husband Michael's 9-1-1 call, found her face-down and unconscious. She was not breathing and had no pulse. <b>They</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> resuscitate {{her and she was}} transported to the Humana Northside Hospital.

5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} classification {{arrangements were}} proposed by Pseudo-Geber (in the Geber corpus, c. 1310), Paracelsus (De Natura Rerum libri nonem, 1525–6; and later works), Basil Valentine (Conclusiones, 1624), and Boerhaave (Elementa Chemiæ, 1733). <b>They</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> separate the more characteristic metals from substances having those characteristics {{to a lesser}} degree. Such substances included zinc, antimony, bismuth, stibnite, pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or bastard metals.|$|E
5|$|The Boston Red Sox invited Nova {{to their}} Dominican academy, where <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> sign him. Nova {{declined}} their contract offer, however, as the Red Sox are rivals of the Yankees.

40|$|The Holy Grail in the {{phenomenology}} {{of religion}} (and, {{to a lesser}} extent, the sociology of religion) is a definition of religion that actually works, but, so far, this {{seems to have been}} elusive. Classical definitions of religion—substantive (e. g. Tylor) and functionalist (e. g. Durkheim) —fail, in part because <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> be in three places at once, as it were: <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> distinguish religion from non-religion; <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> capture what religions have in common; and <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> grasp the 'heart', or 'core', of religion. Consequently, family resemblance definitions of religion replace certainty and precision for its own sake with a more pragmatic and heuristic approach, embracing doubt and putting forward definitions that give us a better understanding (Verstehen) of religion. In this paper, I summarise some 'new' definitions of religion that take this approach, before proposing and defending another one, defining religion as non-propositional and 'apophatic', thus accepting that doubt is central to religion itself, {{as well as to the}} analysis of religion...|$|R
5|$|The Gracchus brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were Romans {{who both}} served as tribunes {{in the late}} 2nd century BC. <b>They</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> pass land reform {{legislation}} that would redistribute the major aristocratic landholdings among the urban poor and veterans, {{in addition to other}} reform measures.

5|$|A {{new stage}} {{adaptation}} of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel The Moonbather, the play was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003. Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and Foggy, the play featured the trio as <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> {{get to the bottom}} of the disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. The play was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.|$|E

5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills.

Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. <b>They</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E
5|$|As <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} up the hill, several Chinese {{soldiers from}} a nearby trench opened fire, injuring another soldier. According to witness reports, Bleak rushed the trench and dove into it, tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E

5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. <b>They</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E
