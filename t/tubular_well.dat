In view of the shortcomings of traditional three-dimensional (3 D) modeling methods for well trajectory, a new method of slice-based 3 D modeling for the <b>tubular</b> <b>well</b> trajectory was put forward, by which a 3 D well trajectory model was established. The method can realize the 3 D <b>tubular</b> <b>well</b> trajectory seamless connection efficiently and conveniently without interpolation smoothing treatment of the well trajectory’s crook. In order to provide a convenience to observe and analyze intuitively as well as control the well trajectory effectively in drilling for the drilling staff, realized 3 D visualization of the well trajectory based on virtual reality technology and provided flexible human-computer interaction functions with which the drilling staff can make interactive operation such as zooming, translating and rotating, etc., for the 3 D well trajectory. Consequently, the well trajectory can be observed from multi-azimuth and multi-angle, improving the oil reservoir encountering rate. Finally, an application example of 3 D visualization for well trajectory in Dagang Oilfield was given...|$|E

A randomized complete block design in split plot scheme with two replications within of block. In the plot the water types were designated (well water and fish effluent), in the subplot the treatments of the factorial 2 x 2, resulting from the combination of two match levels (with and without natural phosphate) with two cow manure levels (with and without cow manure), and in the sub-plot the evaluation times (before and after the bell pepper culture). Soil samples were collected before and after the bell pepper cultivation of 0 - 20 cm depth. After the assembly of the overhead irrigation and distribution of the treatments, it was collected of each plot a soil sample for the accomplishment of the physiochemical analyses. To verify the alterations happened in the soil with the treatments, after the last crop, to the 100 days after culture. Two sources of irrigation waters were used.

30|$|Emulsification {{has been}} widely used in the oil industry. The thermal {{stability}} of emulsified systems, such as emulsified gels or acids, is critical for the placement success of the emulsified system. Early separation of the system in a <b>tubular</b> <b>well</b> leads to corrosion. In the present study, the stability of emulsified polyacrylamide/polyethylenimine (PAM/PEI) gels is investigated in high-temperature and high-salinity (HTHS) environments. The influences of different parameters such as surfactant concentration, water–oil ratio, salinity, intensity of mixing and temperature on the droplet size and the emulsion thermal stability are studied. The droplet size of the PAM/PEI system, which is emulsified in diesel, decreases, and the separation time increases with increasing mixing speed, surfactant concentration, and salinity. The emulsions with smaller droplets are thermally stable compared with large droplets since the rate of droplet coalescence is low. The effect of emulsion stability on gelation kinetics and gel strength is investigated. The emulsification reduces both the gel strength and the gelation rate. The cross-linking (gelation) rate in the unemulsified PAM/PEI is almost ten times higher than that in the emulsified gels. This gelation process is slow {{in the case of}} stable emulsified PAM/PEI solution and {{is believed to be the}} result of limited heat and mass transfer. The emulsion stability achieved in this work adds to the current understanding of how to control emulsion stability through different parameters to withstand HTHS environments and how this stability influences the gelation process.|$|E

These aspects, combined with low exploitation costs, provided a considerable growth in the groundwater use in the last decades. Groundwater became an important alternative source for public water supply in Brazil. This paper shows the georeferenced location of the groundwater exploitation points in the Lajeado, RS municipality and the potability analysis of this water. The groundwater exploitation {{in the study area}} is accomplished in the Serra Geral and Guarani aquifers and the exploitation points were identified in field campaigns using a GPS receiver and plotted over satellite imagery using remote sensing and geoprocessing techniques. The groundwater potability assessment was based on 100 samples for microbiological and physico-chemical analyses that included 78 samples of <b>tubular</b> <b>wells</b> and 22 of dug wells.

Se na cheia as águas abundam, na seca escasseiam, chegando desfalcar os ribeirinhos seja pela insuficiência e/ou por condições impróprias para consumo. Esse trabalho descreve o aproveitamento do manancial subterrâneo para abastecimento público, através de poço tubular construído na comunidade de várzea de Santo Antônio, no município de Urucará, Estado do Amazonas. O estudo demonstrou a ocorrência de variações nas características físico-químicas da água do poço durante um ciclo das de superfície da região, principalmente a elevação do teor de ferro total no período de cheia máxima, sendo esse um indicativo de falha no processo construtivo do poço, uma vez que a água subterrânea local apresenta condições satisfatórias para o consumo humano. O aproveitamento do manancial subterrâneo em sistemas de abastecimento de água em comunidades de várzea na Amazônia é tecnicamente viável, entretanto, carece de obras de captação corretas, visando a conservação da qualidade da água desse rico ecossistema.
