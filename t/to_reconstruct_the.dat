5|$|Attempts <b>to</b> <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> uncut {{version of}} Greed without {{use of the}} lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique named Greed {{as one of the}} twelve {{greatest}} films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for Greed, which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order <b>to</b> <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos <b>to</b> <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> uncut version of Greed, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.|$|E

5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers <b>to</b> <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> movements of the three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions trying <b>to</b> <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> full {{family tree}} because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E

The results are used to clarify and correct previous studies in which discommensurations have been confused with genuine surface spin-hop states...|$|R
