25|$|The border {{station at}} Holmec was the {{location}} of an alleged war crime perpetrated by Slovenian TO forces, filmed by the Austrian public broadcasting station ORF. Video footage shows {{a small group of}} YPA soldiers standing or walking slowly with raised hands, holding up a white sheet in an apparent attempt to surrender. Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the video segment. Slovene officials maintain that the YPA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station B92 in 2006, with many claiming that the soldiers were shot and killed by Slovenian TO troops and that Slovenia is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> the affair.|$|E

25|$|A schoolboy, Aminulrasyid Amzah, {{was shot}} dead by police after {{allegedly}} trying to escape from a car accident which he was involved in. Aminulrasyid was driving his sister's car without a valid driver's licence after midnight on 3 May 2010, together with his friend, Azamuddin, who was the passenger. He {{had been trying to}} flee a number of motorcyclists who were chasing both boys after their vehicle had sideswiped a car earlier that night. After Aminulrasyid was shot, his friend Azamuddin was assaulted and beaten by the police but managed to escape. The IGP and the police have made many statements to the press saying that Aminulrasyid was trying to ram a police roadblock as well as carrying a weapon in the car. Azamuddin and Aminulrasyid's family has refuted many of the police claims. Many members of the public and the opposing politicians have criticised the police's response, alluding {{to the fact that the}} police are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> the incident and fabricate evidence. The boy's family has rejected calls for an inquest into the shooting because they did not believe they would receive a fair and transparent investigation, especially from the police. Instead, they have called on the government to establish a royal commission of inquiry to investigate Aminulrasyid's death. A special eight-member panel has been formed to scrutinise the investigation of the shooting; however, opposing politicians and the boy's family have derided the formation of the panel as a publicity stunt by the government. On 24 March 2016, the High Court in Selangor awarded more than MYR400,000 in damages to the family of the victim to alleviate their pain and suffering.|$|E
500|$|Nancy's {{relationship}} with her children was not always as close as the bond with her husband. She frequently quarreled with her biological children and her stepchildren. Her {{relationship with}} Patti was the most contentious; Patti flouted American conservatism, rebelled against her parents by joining the nuclear freeze movement, and authored many anti-Reagan books. The nearly 20 years of family feuding left Patti very much estranged from both her mother and father. Soon after her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Patti and her mother reconciled and began to speak on a daily basis. Nancy's disagreements with Michael were also public matters; in 1984, she {{was quoted as saying}} that the two were in an [...] "estrangement right now". Michael responded that Nancy was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> for the fact she had not met his daughter, Ashley, who had been born nearly a year earlier. They too eventually made peace. Nancy was thought to be closest to her stepdaughter Maureen during the White House years, but each of the Reagan children experienced periods of estrangement from their parents.|$|E
