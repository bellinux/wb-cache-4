The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of <b>the</b> (<b>generalized)</b> Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood {{in order to understand}} string theory. This is so since tachyon states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E
