This work mainly focuses on the performance analysis of PHY layer security via two co-operative schemes (DF and AF) by taking all main fading phenomenon's like path loss, phase fading and shadow fading into consideration.

40|$|Abstract Governments {{worldwide}} {{have been}} encouraging private participation in transportation infrastructure. To increase {{the feasibility of}} a project, public-private partnership (PPP) may include guarantees or other support to reduce the risks for private investors. It is necessary to value these opportunities under a real options framework and thereby analyze the project's economic feasibility and risk allocation. However, within this structure, sponsors have an implicit option to abandon the project that should be simultaneously valued. Thus, this article proposes a hypothetical toll road concession in Brazil with a minimum <b>traffic</b> <b>guarantee,</b> a maximum traffic ceiling, and an implicit abandonment option. Different combinations of the minimum and maximum levels are presented, resulting in very high or even negative value added to the net present value (NPV).

In the transport sector, for example, project finance and PPP are largely used in toll road concessions.

Some real options can be identified in these structures and it is necessary to use the correct methodology to analyze project economic feasibility and risk allocation. Regarding the revenue risk in transport projects, different models of guarantees have been proposed. In Brazil, the 4 th Line of the Metro of São Paulo is the first example of a PPP implementation and the mechanism used to mitigate the demand risk was based on minimum and maximum levels of demand.

We attack these problems and set out routing in outer space, a new routing mechanism that transforms any shortest path routing protocol (or an approximated version of it) into a new protocol that, in case of uniform <b>traffic,</b> <b>guarantees</b> that every node of the network is responsible for relaying {{the same number of}} messages, on expectation.

40|$|Concession {{contracts}} in highways often include {{some kind of}} clauses (for example, a minimum <b>traffic</b> <b>guarantee)</b> that allow for better management of the business risks. The value of these clauses may be important and should {{be added to the}} total value of the concession. However, in these cases, traditional valuation techniques, like the NPV (net present value) of the project, are insufficient. An alternative methodology for the valuation of highway concession is one based on the real options approach. This methodology is generally built on the assumption of the evolution of traffic volume as a GBM (geometric Brownian motion), which is the hypothesis analyzed in this paper. First, a description of the methodology used for the analysis of the existence of unit roots (i. e., the hypothesis of non-stationarity) is provided. The Dickey-Fuller approach has been used, which is the most common test for this kind of analysis. Then this methodology is applied to perform a statistical analysis of traffic series in Spanish toll highways. For this purpose, data on the AADT (annual average daily traffic) on a set of highways have been used. The period of analysis is around thirty years in most cases. The main outcome of the research is that the hypothesis that traffic volume follows a GBM process in Spanish toll highways cannot be rejected. This result is robust, and therefore it {{can be used as a}} starting point for the application of the real options theory to assess toll highway concessions...|$|E

However some users {{may not be}} able to describe their traffic accurately enough for the network to provide such guarantees. By sending a dynamic feedback signal about the current utilisation of network resources, the network could provide loss guarantees to users who respond appropriately, even without prior traffic descriptors. One possible feedback signal is a price per unit of network resource, based on the network load level : when the load is high, the price is high, and when the load is low, the price is low or zero. We outline a distributed iterative pricing algorithm, and show through simulations that it can simultaneously increase both network and economic efficiency.
