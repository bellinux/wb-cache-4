30|$|A {{big issue}} {{of the program is}} that it {{consists}} of a presence-only dataset that is known to suffer from bias (Blossey and Hunt-Joshi 2003; Fithian et al. 2015). Presence-absence datasets are more reliable. Therefore, we will incorporate notifications in the application to encourage users to report places and times when no encounter took place. The downside of such feature is that it may become annoying. The <b>notification</b> <b>shall</b> therefore only trigger rarely (once a week), with the possibility to turn the feature off. Finally, the notification feature may be used to spread timely information or help educate the citizens for example on the differences between mosquitoes and non-biting mites.|$|R
