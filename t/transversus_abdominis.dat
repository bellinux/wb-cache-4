25|$|The {{physiological}} {{school of}} thought contends {{that in the case}} of inguinal hernia, the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause. They contend that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> aponeurotic arch.|$|E
25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the psoas major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the iliac crest between the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> and abdominal internal oblique, and then run above the inguinal ligament. Both nerves give off muscular branches to both these muscles. Iliohypogastric supplies sensory branches to {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique above the inguinal ring to supply sensory branches to the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the inguinal ring and supplies sensory branches to the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|E

5000|$|Primary: <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> muscle, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles (abductors), the {{adductor}} {{muscles of}} the hip, and the external, and internal obliques.|$|E
50|$|The rectus abdominis and <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> {{contract}} continually {{while performing}} push-ups {{to hold the}} body {{off the floor and}} keep the legs and torso aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the lateral}} {{border of the}} quadratus lumborum they pierce the {{posterior}} aponeurosis of the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> and are carried forward between this muscle and the obliquus internus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{benefit of}} focused {{training}} on the [...] "deep core" [...] muscles such as the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> has been disputed, with some experts advocating a more comprehensive training regimen.|$|E
5000|$|It then pierces the {{posterior}} aponeurosis of the <b>Transversus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> and, passing forward between this muscle and the Internal Oblique, anastomoses with the superior epigastric, lower intercostal, and lumbar arteries.|$|E
5000|$|Keeping the abs tense {{to support}} the back. This likely means {{contraction}} of the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> as contraction of the rectus abdominis would cause the back to round and de-activate the lower back.|$|E
50|$|Major muscles {{included}} are the pelvic floor muscles, <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> multifidus, {{internal and external}} obliques, rectus abdominis, erector spinae (sacrospinalis) especially the longissimus thoracis, and the diaphragm. Minor core muscles include the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, and trapezius.|$|E
50|$|The arcuate line must be incised at its lateral-most {{point in}} order to enter the space of Retzius and Bogros from within the rectus sheath {{to carry out the}} caudal portion of {{dissection}} during retrorectus repair and <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> release.|$|E
50|$|Opposite the {{anterior}} superior iliac {{spine of the}} ilium, it gives off a large ascending branch. This branch ascends between the internal oblique muscle and the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> muscle, supplying them, and anastomosing with the lumbar arteries and inferior epigastric artery.|$|E
50|$|They {{have the}} same {{arrangement}} as the upper ones {{as far as the}} anterior ends of the intercostal spaces, where they pass behind the costal cartilages, and between the Obliquus internus and <b>Transversus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> to the sheath of the Rectus abdominis, which they perforate.|$|E
50|$|In medical vernacular, the {{abdominal}} wall most commonly {{refers to the}} layers composing the anterior abdominal wall which, {{in addition to the}} layers mentioned above, includes the three layers of muscle: the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> (transverse abdominal muscle), the internal (obliquus internus) and the external oblique (obliquus externus).|$|E
50|$|The {{posterior}} {{surface is}} concave, and directed backward and downward; {{that of the}} first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the six or seven inferior ones to the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> muscle and the diaphragm.|$|E
50|$|To the {{external}} lip are attached the Tensor fasciæ latæ, Obliquus externus abdominis, and Latissimus dorsi, and along its whole length the fascia lata; to the intermediate line the Obliquus internus abdominis; {{to the internal}} lip, the fascia iliaca, the <b>Transversus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> Quadratus lumborum, Sacrospinalis, and Iliacus.|$|E
5000|$|... "Leg raise" [...] usually {{indicates}} that the mobilization only occurs in the joints of the leg. Both ab muscles (rectus and <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis)</b> are used to isometrically stabilize the spine to resist extension and posterior pelvic tilt that would otherwise occur with the legs lifted in front.|$|E
50|$|Superior to the arcuate line, the {{internal}} oblique aponeurosis splits to envelop the rectus abdominis muscle both anteriorly and posteriorly. Inferior to the arcuate line, {{the internal}} oblique and <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> aponeuroses merge and pass superficial (i.e. anteriorly) to the rectus muscle. Here, both Spigelian and exceedingly rare arcuate line hernias may occur.|$|E
50|$|It {{emerges from}} the lateral border of the psoas major just {{inferior}} to the iliohypogastric, and passes obliquely across the quadratus lumborum and iliacus. The ilioinguinal nerve then perforates the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> near the anterior part of the iliac crest, and communicates with the iliohypogastric nerve between the transversus and the internal oblique muscle.|$|E
50|$|It is {{retained}} {{in contact with}} the posterior wall of the abdomen by the peritoneum, which covers its anterior surface and sides, its posterior surface being connected by loose areolar tissue with the iliacus, quadratus lumborum, aponeurotic origin of <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> and with the front of the lower and lateral part of the right kidney.|$|E
50|$|The {{transverse}} abdominal muscle (TVA), {{also known}} as the transverse abdominis, transversalis muscle and <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> muscle, is a muscle layer of the anterior and lateral (front and side) abdominal wall which is deep to (layered below) the internal oblique muscle. It is thought by most fitness instructors to be a significant component of the core.|$|E
50|$|The {{physiological}} {{school of}} thought contends {{that in the case}} of inguinal hernia, the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause. They contend that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> aponeurotic arch.|$|E
50|$|Each {{corresponds}} with the lateral {{border of the}} rectus abdominis, extends from the cartilage of the ninth rib to the pubic tubercle, and is formed by the aponeurosis of the internal oblique at its line of division to enclose the rectus, reinforced anteriorly by the external oblique and posteriorly by the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> above the arcuate line (also known as linea semicircularis or Douglas' line).|$|E
50|$|The nerve {{emerges from}} the psoas major in the outer part of its upper border, and crosses {{in front of the}} quadratus lumborum to the iliac crest, running behind the kidneys. Near the crest of the ilium the iliohypogastric nerve then pierces through the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> and divides between that muscle and the {{internal}} oblique muscle into a lateral and an anterior cutaneous branch.|$|E
50|$|Spinal {{traction}} as a {{means of}} spinal decompression is often applied without directly touching bones as other methods of traction do. This is sometimes isolated inside-out by inflatable girdles or use of the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> muscle. It is also done in conjunction with thigh-supported flexed-hip traction (inversion chairs, back hyperextensions) or done in conjunction with whole-leg traction (boots, tables) via inverted forms of suspension.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a common}} set of layers {{covering}} and forming all the walls: the deepest being the visceral peritoneum, which covers many of the abdominal organs (most of the large and small intestines, for example), and the parietal peritoneum- which covers the visceral peritoneum below it, the extraperitoneal fat, the transversalis fascia, the internal and external oblique and <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> aponeurosis, and a layer of fascia, which has different names according to what it covers (e.g., transversalis, psoas fascia).|$|E
50|$|The ilioinguinal nerve closely {{follows the}} iliohypogastric nerve on the quadratus lumborum, but then passes below it {{to run at}} the level of the iliac crest. It pierces the lateral {{abdominal}} wall and runs medially {{at the level of}} the inguinal ligament where it supplies motor branches to both <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> and sensory branches through the external inguinal ring to the skin over the pubic symphysis and the lateral aspect of the labia majora or scrotum.|$|E
50|$|The aim of deep {{abdominal}} co-contraction exercises is {{to train}} muscles surrounding the lumbar spine which provide {{stability of the}} spine. Spondylolysis results in a spinal instability and disrupts patterns of co-recruitment between muscle synergies. Specifically, local muscles that attach directly to the spine are affected. The lumbar multifidis and <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> play a direct role in stabilizing the lumbar spine. Instead the local muscles in individuals with spondylolysis are vulnerable to dysfunction, which results in abnormal spinal stability causing chronic low back pain. To compensate, the large torque producing global muscles are used to stabilize the spine.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{efficient}} {{inguinal hernia}} repair {{was described by}} Edoardo Bassini in the 1880s. The Bassini technique is a [...] "tension" [...] repair, in which {{the edges of the}} defect are sewn back together, without any mesh. In the Bassini technique, the conjoint tendon (formed by the distal ends of the <b>transversus</b> <b>abdominis</b> and internal oblique muscles) is approximated to the inguinal ligament and closed. Today, Bassini's main interest is historical. It remains performed in some developing countries, if surgeons do not have knowledge of the mosquito-net alternative to commercial meshes in Lichtenstein repair, or if they ignore more efficient suture-based repairs.|$|E
