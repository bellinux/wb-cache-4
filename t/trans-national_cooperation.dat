40|$|Cooperation may {{be defined}} as the {{collaboration}} between two or more parties which fuels initiatives that have shared, or converging interests and objectives. In the European Union territorial cohesion has recently been included in the draft of the European Constitution and is complementary to the EU drive towards economic and social cohesion. This adds a new dimension to European integration which clearly recognises that considering things from a territorial dimension is a tool for reducing the territorial disparity currently present in the EU. In fact, well before its enlargement, significant disparities in prosperity levels existed both between and within member states: prosperity levels in the ten most dynamic regions of the EU, based on GDP per capita, were nearly three times higher than that of the ten least developed regions and regional differences have widened with enlargement. In this context, the territorial cooperation objective aims to: improve cross-border cooperation through joint, local and regional initiatives; strengthen <b>trans-national</b> <b>cooperation</b> by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to Community priorities as well as to strengthen interregional cooperation and the exchange of experience at the appropriate territorial level. Three different typologies of territorial cooperation have been identified with the European territory: cross-border cooperation, <b>trans-national</b> <b>cooperation</b> and Interregional cooperation. The paper focuses on the territorial cooperation objective and presents a case study with large and strong economic, social and environmental disparities. It includes EU members and non EU members.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the historical legacy and present-day impact of Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine, {{two of the}} earliest pioneers of the documentation movement, and the organization they founded in 1895, known originally as the International Institute for Bibliography (IIB), later as the International Federation for Documentation (FID). Otlet, La Fontaine, and the FID are remembered for their bold, positivist vision of creating a complete, accurate, objective master database of all human knowledge in the pre-computer era—a vision partially expressed in the Mundaneum, a massive collection of hard-copy data assembled in their home country of Belgium {{in the early twentieth}} century. Predictably, this ambitious project failed. Yet, as this paper explains, Otlet, La Fontaine, and their organization nevertheless had a lasting and significant impact on the evolution of modern information science, identifying both goals and problems for later information theorists that remain relevant even in the digital age. Their prewar documentalist movement, inquiring into the fundamental nature of documents and of information, {{paved the way for the}} work of postwar documentalists including Suzanne Briet and S. R. Rangathan, among others; in turn, the work of the postwar documentalists overlaps with and impacted the rise of computer-based information theory and science and the dawn of the digital age from the 1950 s onward. The FID itself persisted as an active organization into the 1990 s, convening conferences, publishing books, and generally promoting international bibliographic research and standardization as well as international scholarly cooperation—which relates to the wider legacy of Otlet and La Fontaine as early pioneers of international peace, <b>trans-national</b> institutional <b>cooperation,</b> and global pooling of information to confront human problems. Their activities were direct precursors of, for instance, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Even as to their positivist presumptions which ultimately led to failure, the example of Otlet and La Fontaine remain relevant—for humans generally, and scientists, social scientists, and other professionals in particular, remain all too prone to positivistic fallacies of perfect and objective knowledge, notwithstanding the warnings against such presumptions from postmodernism...|$|R

Version: FinalThe Maltese development pattern is influenced by the typical features of small island states: scarce natural resources, high density of population, lack of critical mass in infrastructure investment, high external dependency etc. These features have an impact on transport, the environment and the sustainability of tourism and make it necessary to strengthen the Island’s knowledge-based economy in order to promote competitiveness. EU Cohesion Policy contributes considerably to tackling these issues through support from the ERDF and Cohesion Fund, while the Island participates in cross-border, <b>trans-national</b> and interregional <b>cooperation</b> programmes. The priorities of these programmes are highly complementary and consistent with the key development challenges: the support is concentrated mainly on sustainable development and environmental protection, (e. g. waste management and water treatment plants), knowledge and innovation as well as transport. Malta has been allocated EUR 728 million of ERDF and Cohesion Fund for the 2007 - 2013 period. Environment-related investment represents a key priority and accounts for 38 % of the total allocation; 25 % of the total ERDF has been allocated to accessibility and transport; around 22 % has been allotted to territorial development and 13 % to support enterprise environment. The overall commitment rate as at end 2009 amounted to around 50 % of total funding allocated and during 2009 there were 229 projects (including aid schemes) being implemented. In 2009 the Programme started producing its first outputs and results on the ground: first signs of construction of infrastructure; equipment being procured and s mobilisation of much needed support for enterprises. The recent economic crisis did not change the strategy and the objectives of the OP, which are arguably well suited for fostering the upturn in the economy, thanks to the focus on transport infrastructure, environment, energy territorial development (including tourism) and enterprise support. To boost investment in enterprises and mitigate the consequences of the crisis, in some cases, the allocation of the funds was diverted from public infrastructure to private sector support (e. g. EUR 12 million were allocated to a number of aid schemes for firms, focusing on e-business development, R&D, international competitiveness, innovation and energy). Evidence on performance of intervention is limited and it is too early to identify examples of good practice. The Mid-Term Evaluation of the ERDF OP is currently being carried out and some results can be expected by the end of the year. The ex ante evaluation of the OP, carried out initially, is mostly an analysis of the coherence of the strategy and did not attempt to assess the potential effects of the programme. An analysis of the effectiveness of projects co-financed by the Structural Funds in 2004 - 2006 examined the achievements of a sample of 13 initiatives, focusing mainly on recommendations for the future in terms of monitoring and collection of data. Some of the main future challenges facing EU Cohesion Policy include: continue to tackle the lack of innovation and entrepreneurial culture and increase the capacity of Malta to generate research and apply new technologies; increase awareness of environmental problems among people and implement larger projects with a significant impact on environmental protection; develop an evaluation culture to systematically assess the performance of policy; improve cooperation between administrative bodiesN/...|$|R

40|$|Farmers Cooperative has {{in recent}} years {{developed}} from national markets to cross-border, international, collaborations. One example is the merger between the Swedish dairy company Arla and Danish MD Foods, where the companies collectively are sought to reduce transaction costs and thus improve efficiency. The Swedish market for commodities (fertilizers and pesticides) in agriculture has for many years been dominated by a few large players, with little opportunity for grain associations and local grain companies to offer their customers a varied range of commodities with a competitive pricing. To change this state, a majority of Swedish and Danish grain associations and local grain companies have established a <b>trans-national</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Through {{the establishment of the}} organization DLA Agro, they offer their customers a good variety of products with competitive prices. This study investigates thus according to the theory of cooperative models to what extent and how the DLA Agro helps to create benefits for the Swedish member companies. Crucial to this analysis is to DLA Agro's special organizational features can be expected to have significant bearing on the transaction and agency costs, which member companies are experiencing. Organizational features means that it is a federal organization and that it is <b>trans-national</b> <b>cooperation,</b> which has consequences for the financing, governance and operations. The method for conducting the survey consists of qualitative interview techniques with detailed interviews of every Swedish association and companies connected to the DLA Agro. The interviews indicate that members largely feel that the DLA Agro has a good relationship with the Swedish member group. The fact that the member group is relatively small in number and largely homogeneous with regard to the benefits members want out of it helps to contribute to the cooperation. Also that DLA Agro has a limited business portfolio with few products makes it easier for the cooperation to focus on reducing transaction costs. An important factor explaining the success of the cooperation {{is that it does not}} store any collective capital within the DLA Agro. This facilitates control of the DLA Agro, as potential conflict of interest on what the collective capital is to be invested in reduces. The fact that DLA Agro has inscribed in the statutes that members must sign a declaration of loyalty and the obligation to purchase ensures DLA Agro that the members will purchase every year. By doing so the risk of getting passive members with too divergent business interests reduces. The survey also shows that future conflicts may arise. This is because a number of respondents would like the opportunity to trade in seeds. This could cause problems because a number of the members in the Swedish member group are also grain producers...|$|E

The relevant arguments are presented in the two main parts of the book. The first (Part 2) on ‘integration vs. fragmentation in Southeast Europe: forces, structures and trends ’ addresses the socio-economic and political situation, while the second (Part 3) focuses on ‘spatial development perspectives: concepts, facts and visions ’ in order to examine key aspects of spatial organization and spatial development trends. In a concluding chapter (Part 4) the prospects for the integration of Southeast Europe are outlined. The introductory chapter itself consists of three sections and an epilogue. In the first section the changing geography of Southeast Europe is presented with reference to basic historical, geographical and socio-economic features while EU policies are taken into account in an attempt to assess their impact upon the territorial integration of the area. The second section turns to a larger scale by looking on european spatial development trends and the ongoing debate on european spatial planning, while special emphasis is given to the decisive role played by the Interreg Initiative for the promotion of <b>trans-national</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Together, the above sections form an appropriate background for reading of chapters, and the synopsis of these can be found in the third section of the introduction.

40|$|Regulation of {{labour market}} {{intermediaries}} {{and the role}} of social partners in preventing trafficking of labour Paper submitted by Anna Paraskevopoulou, (London Metropolitan University); Andrea Fromm, (Eurofound) Full report available: [URL] Introduction This report aims to {{contribute to the development of}} a best practice guide for public authorities on monitoring and enforcing rules and regulations relevant to labour market intermediaries to prevent trafficking for labour exploitation. The report brings together research findings on two main areas: how labour market intermediaries are regulated by public authorities in the different Member States, and to what extent social partners’ activities are effective in preventing trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation. The main focus of the report is on trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation and not on trafficking for sexual exploitation. The report is based on information provided by Eurofound’s network of European correspondents across all 28 EU Member States and Norway. Policy context Since the late 1990 s, the drive to prevent trafficking in human beings has been high on the EU agenda. The adoption of the Palermo Protocol in 2002 to prevent trafficking in people, especially women and children, underpinned the adoption of the EU Council Framework Decision and an EU plan to address trafficking in the same year. In 2011, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting victims. Taking its lead from the anti-trafficking directive, the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings 2012 – 2016 (COM (2012) 286 final) includes a set of targeted actions aimed at prevention, protection, prosecution and partnerships. The strategy also identifies recruitment as an area relevant to trafficking and highlights the importance of including trade unions and employer organisations when developing anti-trafficking policies. Key findings The report examines the effectiveness of legislation, regulation and social partner activity to counter the potential involvement of labour market intermediaries in trafficking for labour exploitation. The first part of the report discusses the policy context and definitions while considering potential ways in which labour market intermediaries could be linked to trafficking. Labour market intermediaries are private or public entities or institutions mediating between the individual seeking employment and the employer, operating either as Employment Placement Agencies (EPAs) or Temporary Work Agencies (TWAs). The research shows that there was a rapid escalation in the number of labour market intermediaries towards the end of the twentieth century after many EU countries lifted restrictions and began to regulate temporary agency work. In some sectors and geographical areas, intermediaries have become strongly associated with migration and cost-reduction as well as flexibility. While the majority of labour market intermediaries are formally registered enterprises, some operate informally without being registered. The relevant European and international regulations include the Temporary Agency Work Directive (2008 / 104 /EC) and ILO Conventions No. 96 and No. 181 which govern employment agencies, as well as different national measures to regulate and monitor LMIs. The most common forms of regulating labour market intermediaries in the EU include licensing, registration or certification schemes. The sectors identified as having problems with trafficking for labour exploitation in most countries are agriculture, construction, domestic work and hotels and restaurants. Other sectors include retail in Belgium and Sweden, beauty and hair salons in Finland, transport in Romania and waste and recycling in Denmark. In terms of their role in preventing and combating trafficking related to labour market intermediaries, social partners provide a great deal of information and experience regarding fraudulent recruitment and labour exploitation. Mutual support and effective cooperation are key to preventing and eradicating trafficking for labour exploitation. At international level, the social partners for the temporary agency sector (Uni Global and CIETT) concluded a Memorandum of Understanding on temporary agency work in 2008 in which both sides pledge their support for a regulatory framework to prohibit agency work from undercutting other workers’ rights and conditions. The research finds that national social partners are increasingly recognising their responsibility in this area, and voicing their concern about the fraudulent recruitment and exploitative labour practices often used by labour market intermediaries. Despite this, however, trafficking for labour exploitation is still not a priority at national level. Social partners across the Member States and Norway have developed various practices to combat trafficking for labour exploitation by labour market intermediaries. These complement state policies and can take a variety of forms, such as: collective agreements, joint initiatives, dialogue with the government, campaigns, systems for handling complaints, <b>trans-national</b> <b>cooperation,</b> developing codes of conduct, providing information and educational material, increased inspections, and the use of media. The report reveals that social partner involvement in this area is often challenging. As employer associations do not cover all LMIs, enforcement, especially in the case of small or medium sized LMIs, can be problematic. Trade unions are not always in a position to reach all workers, particularly those in ‘hidden’ or isolated employment, those working in undeclared work or undocumented migrant workers. Policy pointers Examples of emerging good practice are highlighted throughout the report. National government activities include cross-border cooperation, labour inspectorate activity, introducing legislation and further regulation, supporting cooperation between different authorities, providing guidance through awareness-raising, training and ethical codes, giving support to victims and cooperating with social partners. Many emerging good practice examples from governments, as well as those from social partners, involve targeting victims and attempting to raise awareness about trafficking for labour exploitation. As little was identified which specifically referred to labour market intermediaries, or indeed employers, the report emphasises that more could be done to address the issue by both employers’ associations and trade unions. In countries with a functioning sectoral social dialogue, it could be practical for the social partners to develop a joint strategy to tackle unfair competition and downward pressure on pay and conditions, or job losses. The report recommends that public authorities take into consideration the following guidelines when preparing a best practice guide on monitoring labour market intermediaries: •	Develop clear national definitions of labour market intermediaries, trafficking and labour exploitation based on relevant European Directives and international instruments. •	Use concise definitions to improve the collection of data on the significance and incidence of labour market intermediaries and trafficking for labour exploitation. •	Increase the coverage of labour market intermediaries who are registered, licensed and/or certified. •	Make use of improved registration, licensing and/or certification to help comprehensively enforce and sanction labour market intermediaries which might be engaged at the entry point of trafficking; •	Increase regional and cross-border cooperation among public authorities and the social partners. •	Support coherent and effective bipartite and tripartite joint activities dealing with labour market intermediaries and recruitment practices, and trafficking for labour exploitation. •	Support the social partners in increasing collective representation in order to reach small- and medium-sized labour market intermediaries, as well as workers who are ‘under the radar’...|$|E
