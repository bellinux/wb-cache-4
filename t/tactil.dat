40|$|Recently Sekuler et al. (Nature, 1997) {{investigated}} the motion-bounce illusion {{and found that}} sound can influence ambiguous visual motion perception. Here we {{investigated the}} motion-bounce illusion in the tactile-auditory domain. Using a vibro-tactile belt consisting of 7 vibrators we generated tactile apparent motion stimuli by sequentially activating neighboring motors with an onset of 200 ms between the motors. Starting at {{the left and the}} right hip, two tactile motion stimuli run towards each other. On the body midline an ambiguous event was perceived: either the transition of both stimuli with continuing motion trajectories or a bounce event followed by the reversal of the movement direction. Presenting just the tactile motion stimulus resulted in an ambiguous percept. The presentation of an auditory beep at the time of the collision was sufficient to disambiguate the percept such that a significantly higher proportion of bounces was reported. The presentation of the sound 200 ms or 400 ms before the <b>tactil</b> e collision event reduced the proportion bounces reported and became indistinguishable from the uni-modal baseline condition. This indicates that the temporal window of audio-tactile integration is comparable to that found in the visual-auditory domain.

MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta por 15 lactentes nascidos no Hospital Maternidade de Campinas (SP), para os quais houve solicitação de uma avaliação fonoaudiológica por parte do médico neonatologista responsável. Todos os lactentes foram avaliados uma vez pelo mesmo fonoaudiólogo e pelo mesmo médico otorrinolaringologista. A avaliação funcional da deglutição observou: a) a sensibilidade <b>táctil</b> extra-oral, b) a sensibilidade <b>táctil</b> intra-oral, c) o reflexo nauseoso e d) a movimentação dos bucinadores. A avaliação da deglutição videoendoscópica analisou: a) sensibilidade na cartilagem aritenóidea, b) o choro, c) a aspiração, d) a queda de saturação, e) a penetração. Utilizou-se o teste exato de Fisher para pequenas amostras e cada hipótese foi testada com nível de significância de 0, 05. RESULTADOS: Observou-se que existe uma relação de dependência estatisticamente significativa entre as variáveis: 1) aspiração após fase faríngea e a penetração (alta e baixa) e 2) sensibilidade extra-oral nas bochechas e a sensibilidade na cartilagem aritenóidea. CONCLUSÕES: Este último resultado mostra a associação entre um achado funcional obtido pelo fonoaudiólogo e um achado videoendoscópico do médico otorrinolaringologista, o que evidencia a importância do trabalho conjunto desses dois profissionais da saúde. BACKGROUND: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: 1) to detect clinical criteria on the evaluation of dysphagy in preterm newborns; 2) to analyze the association between the functional and the videoendoscopy findings and 3) to show {{the relevance of the}} joint work of the Speech Therapist and the Otolaryngologist criteria on the evaluation of dysphagy in preterm syndromic and pathologic newborns. METHODS: The sample comprised fifteen infants born in Maternity Campinas Hospital, Campinas-SP, to whom was requested a Speech Therapist evaluation by the Neonatologist. All the infants were evaluated once by the same Speech Therapist and the Otolaryngologist. The functional evaluation of swallowing considered: a) the extra oral tactile sensibility, b) the intra oral tactile sensibility, c) the nauseous reflex and d) the buccinator movement. The evaluation of the videoendoscopy swallowing analyzed a) the sensibility in the arytenoid cartilage, b) the crying, c) the aspiration, d) desaturation and e) the penetration. The exact test of Fisher was applied for small samples and each hypothesis was tested with significance level of 0. 05. RESULTS: At the end of the study, a statistically dependence relation between the variants was noticed: 1) aspiration after pharyngeal phase and penetration (high and low) and 2) extra oral sensibility on the cheeks and the sensibility on the arytenoid cartilage. CONCLUSION: This last result shows the association between a functional finding obtained by the Speech Therapist and a videoendoscopy finding achieved by the Otolaryngologist, that shows clearly the relevance of the team work among these two health professionals...|$|E

In {{the search for}} key factors governing the outcome of com-petition, we examined the instantaneous predation efficiency and its light dependency. The visual predator Gobius-culus flavescens and the tactile predator Bolinopsis infundibulum were used as experimental models for the two predation modes. The predation rate of G. flavescens was adequately described by Holling’s curvilinear disc equa-tion, and that of B. infundibulum was proportional to prey density. However, because of superfluous feeding, the feeding rate of B. infundibulum differed from the predation rate and approached the asymptotic limitation at high prey levels. The predation rate was reduced for G. flavescens at irradiances, 5 – 10 mmol photons m 22 s 21, whereas light had no {{significant impact on the}} feeding pattern of B. infundibulum. Provided sufficient light, the predation rate of G. flavescens was several orders of magnitude higher than that of B. infundibulum. These results are consistent with the results of other studies, which suggests that the maximum clearance rate (Cmax) of visual and tactile predators is described by the power functions Cmax 5 3. 42 3 1027 L 2. 94 and Cmax 5 6. 02 3 1028 L 1. 77, respectively, where L is the length of the organisms in centimeters.

Neurophysiologic symptoms include numbness and/or tingling, impaired touch sensitivity, impaired manual dexterity and reduced grip strength in the hands. The Stockholm Workshop Scale is commonly used for sensorineural (SN) staging (0 SN- 3 SN). Sensorineural symptoms of this in combination with difficulties in handling small objects may interfere both with the workers social- and work-related activities (Sakakibara et al., 2005). 2. OBJECTIVE The objective of this work was to study the development of neurophysiologic symptoms and vibration perception thresholds in a cohort of young vibration-exposed workers. 3. m e t h o d s The follow-up study in 2006 / 2007 comprised 108 young male vibration-exposed workers (mean-age was 22. 6 ± 1. 0 y) from the machine shop and construction industries, who had been followed since they finished school. They were compared with 21 male non-exposed referents (mean-age 22. 4 ± 0. 9 y). All participants completed several questionnaires related to working and medical history, smoking, alcohol consumption, previous and on-going vibration exposure and symptoms of sensorineural disturbances. The neurophysiologic function was checked by the determination of vibration perception thresholds (VPTs) at 31. 5 and 125 Hz and by Semmes Weinstein’s Monofilament tests.

Here, we expand on this work {{by examining the}} relationship between excitation and inhibition along both spatial and temporal dimensions and comparing these properties across anatomical areas. To that end, we characterized the spatiotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) of 32 slowly adapting type 1 (SA 1) and 21 rapidly adapting peripheral afferents and of 138 neurons in cortical areas 3 b and 1 using identical random probe stimuli. STRFs of peripheral afferents consist of a rapidly appearing excitatory region followed by an in-field (replacing) inhibitory region. STRFs of SA 1 afferents also exhibit flanking (surround) inhibition that {{can be attributed to}} skin mechanics. Cortical STRFs had longer time courses and greater inhibition compared with peripheral afferent STRFs, with less replacing inhibition in area 1 neurons compared with area 3 b neurons. The greater inhibition observed in cortical STRFs point to the existence of underlying intracortical mechanisms. In addition, the shapes of excitatory and inhibitory lobes of both peripheral and cortical STRFs remained mostly stable over time, suggesting that their feature selectivity remains constant throughout the time course of the neural response. Finally, the gradual increase in the proportion of surround inhibition from the periphery to area 3 b to area 1, and the concomitant decrease in response linearity of these neurons indicate the emergence of increasingly feature-specific response properties along the somatosensory pathway.

40|$|Os autores apresentam dois casos de polineuropatia carencial (PC) entre os índios Xavantes, em que o arroz era o alimento exclusivo no caso 1 e quase exclusivo no caso 2. O arroz consumido por esses índios era o beneficiado ou despolpado. A intoxicação pelo cianeto da {{mandioca}} ou de outros vegetais foi afastada. RELATO DOS CASOS. Foram observados em suas aldeias dois índios com 18 e 25 anos, com história progressiva de fraqueza, diminuição da força muscular e emagrecimento. Removidos ao Hospital São Paulo, notou-se, no exame neurológico do caso 1, atrofia da musculatura distal dos membros superiores e inferiores, déficit motor distalmente com grau zero na musculatura flexora, reflexos profundos abolidos, reflexo cutâneo plantar sem resposta bilateralmente, sensibilidade <b>táctil,</b> dolorosa e palestésica diminuída distalmente nos membros inferiores. No exame neurológico do caso 2, notou-se hiporreflexia proximal nos membros superiores, arreflexia nas porções distais dos membros superiores e inferiores, hipoestesia <b>táctil</b> e dolorosa nos pés, hipoacusia à direita. As eletroneuromiografias mostraram anormalidades compatíveis com polineuropatia sensitivo-motora simétrica, de padrão axonal desmielinizante no caso 1 e de predomínio desmielimizante no caso 2. Os exames de líquor foram normais. DISCUSSÃO. A polineuropatia foi caracterizada pela história clínica, pelos exames neurológicos, eletroneuromiográficos e líquor. O diagnóstico de PC ficou estabelecido pela história clínica e pelos exames eletroneuromiográficos sugestivos de polineuropatia periférica de causa nutricional. Esta PC não se enquadra nas mieloneuropatias como a neuropatia atáxica tropical, a paraparesia espástica e a neuropatia de Cuba. CONCLUSÃO. A PC dos Xavantes deve-se à deficiência da tiamina (vitamina B 1), sendo o beribéri seco, tendo como causa o consumo do arroz beneficiado industrialmente como alimento exclusivo ou quase exclusivo. A polineuropatia dos Xavantes é diferente da neuropatia verificada entre os índios Kreen-Akrore e a observada entre os adolescentes índios do Parque do Xingu. The authors present {{two cases}} of polyneuropathy deficiency among Xavante indians where the sole food was rice in case 1 and almost so in case 2. The rice consumed by these indians was processed or hulled. Intoxication by cyanide from maniot or other vegetables was excluded. CASE REPORT - Two indians aged 18 and 25 {{years with a}} progressive history of weaness, decrease in muscular force and thinning were observed in their villages. On removal to the Hospital São Paulo, atrophy of the distal musculature of {{the upper and lower}} limbs, motor deficit distally with zero degree in the flexor musculature, abolished deep reflexes, plantar cutaneous reflex without response bilaterally, decreased tactile, painful and pallesthetic sensitivity distally in the lower limbs were noted on neurological examination of case 1. On neurological examination of case 2 proximal hyporeflexia in the upper limbs, areflexia in the distal portions of the upper and lower limbs, tactile and painful hypoesthesia in the feet, right hypoacousis were noted. Electromyography showed abnormalities compatible with symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy with an axonal demyelination pattern in case 1 and predominantly demyelinizing in case 2. Cerebrospinal fluid tests were normal. DISCUSSION - Polyneuropathy was characterized by the clinical history and by neurological, electromyographic and cerebrospinal fluid tests. The diagnosis of polyneuropathy deficiency was established by the clinical history and by electromyography suggesting peripheral polyneuropathy of nutritional origin. This neuropathy deficiency does not fit myeloneuropathies such as ataxic tropical neuropathy, spastic paraparesis and Cuba neuropathy. CONCLUSION - The Xavante polyneuropathy deficiency is caused by thiamine (vitamin B 1) deficiency, that is dry beriberi, owing to consumption of industrially processed rice as sole or almost sole food. The Xavante polyneuropathy is different from the neuropathy observed among Kreen-Akrore indians and from that of adolescent indians in the Xingu Park...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{neuronal}} encoding of sensory stimuli have been performed based on spike responses. The classically considered neuronal response features like spike count, spike timing or ISIs rely on the all-ornothing characteristic of spike responses. However, {{little is known about}} stimulus encoding on the level of integrated postsynaptic responses. In particular, no standard methods exist to analyze stimulus encoding with graded potentials. Moreover, the huge amount of stimulus-independent fluctuations present in intracellularly recorded membrane potentials complicates the analysis of graded responses. In this study, we use interneurons of the medical leech to analyze stimulus encoding based on graded membrane potential fluctuations. The local bend network controls the reflex behavior of the leech bending away when the skin is touched lightly [1]. It consists of four sensory P (‘pressure’) cells, approximately 20 interneurons and four groups of motorneurons, all of which can be identified individually. EPSPs induced by P cell spikes can be recorded intracellularly from the soma of interneurons, where spike amplitudes are small (< 7 mV) [2]. In a related study (see Pirschel & Kretzberg, this issue) we investigated the encoding of tactile stimulus parameters by P cell spike responses. We found that the intensity of pressure applied to the skin influences the spike count as well as the length of the 1 st interspike interval (ISI) and both response parameters yielded similar stimulus reconstruction performances. In this sense, we have analyzed the influence of presynaptic P cell spike count and 1 st ISI on postsynaptic interneuron responses. Precisely timed P cell spikes were elicited in intracellular double recordings in five cell pairs with short pulses of current injection. We simulated <b>tactil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The input {{orientation}} of the excavators in use today usually comprises two joysticks that control the actuator links individually. In order to perform an excavation task, several different combinations of joystick inputs are required, placing high psychomotor demands on the operator. In training an operator this creates a steep learning curve, with a lengthy training time and {{a reasonable amount of}} experience being required to perform an excavation task skilfully. In this master’s thesis a haptic 1 device was developed, resolving input ergonomics and creating a single input device capable of providing feedback to the operator. The design and construction of the haptic device, with the related control scheme, is presented and discussed. The control scheme combines position and rate control, and relates all the actuator joint positions to a single end-effector point. The control and ergonomic aspects of the haptic device were tested and compared to the traditional two joystick control setup by means of the implementation of a virtual excavator simulator. The simulation was developed in MATLAB, and virtual excavator displayed in an openGL window. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the human factors related to the input orientation. Ten inexperienced test subjects were recruited to perform four sets of tests, where each test required a different level of operator skill. The results indicated that, on average, the test subjects had an increased level of performance after training on the haptic device. These results strongly support the hypothesis that haptic control simplifies the operational tasks required for operating an excavator. 1 The word haptic means of, or relating to, the sense of touch, or <b>tactil...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{way of dealing with}} blindness and deafness has been some forni of sensory substitution- allowing a remaining sense to take over the functions lost {{as the result of the}} sensory impairment. With visual loss, hearing and touch naturally take over as much as they can, vision and touch do the same for hearing, and in the rare cases where both vision and hearing are absent (e. g., Keller 1908), touch provides the primary contact with the external world. However, because unaided sensory substitution is only partially effective, humans have long improvised with artifices to facilitate the substitution of one sense with another. For blind people, braille has served in the place of visible print, and the long cane has supplemented spatial hearing in the sensing of obstacles and local features of the environment. For deaf people, lip reading and sign language have substituted for the loss of speech reception. Finally, for people who are both deaf and blind, fingerspelling by the sender in the palm of the receiver (Jaffe 1994; Reed et al. 1990) and the Tadoma method of speech reception (involving placement of the receiver's hand over the speaker's face) have provided a means by which they can receive messages from others (Reed et al. 1992). Assistive Technology and Sensory Substitution Over the last several decades, a number of new assistive technologies, many based on electronics and computers, have been adopted as more effective ways of promoting sensory substitution. This is especially true for ameliorating blindness. For example, access to print and other forms of text has been improved with these technologies: electronic braille displays, vibtrotactile display of optically sensed print (Bliss et al. 1970), and speech display of text sensed by video camera (Kurzweil 1989). For obstacle avoidance and sensing of the local environment, a number of ultrasonic sensors have been developed that use either auditory or <b>tactil...</b>|$|E

Thirty-eight sites were evaluated on third molars without macroscopic carious cavitation in adult individuals from the city of Barretos (SP), Brazil. Visual inspection (VI), endoscopic evaluation (AcuCam), visual inspection and blunt-tipped exploratory probes (Tactile), conventional bite-wing radiographs (CR), direct bite-wing digital radiograph (DR), and direct digital radiograph with contrast and brightness controled (DRbc) were used by five observers. In order to validate the data, the teeth were sectioned and histologically evaluated. The average sensitivity and specificity values of the methods were respectively: 0, 25, 0, 96 (VI); 0, 15, 0, 92 (AcuCam); 0, 17, 0, 95 (Tactile); 0, 45, 0, 73 (CR); 0, 33, 0, 80 (DR) and 0, 35, 0, 84 (DRbc), the effectiveness of clinical methods (VI, AcuCam and Tactile) as well as that of radiographic methods (CR, DR and DRbc) were comparatively similar. The clinical methods presented a smaller number of false-positive diagnosis than the radiographic methods. It was concluded that visual inspection is an important diagnostic method; conventional bite-wing and digital radiography aid the diagnosis and are equally efficient to diagnose carious lesions in the dentine of teeth without visible cavitation.

A sensibilidade dolorosa estava preservada na maioria das pacientes do Grupo ICB (38 / 42) e em apenas 11 / 33 do Grupo NP (p PURPOSE: loss of cutaneous sensitivity {{has been}} related to lesions of the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) during the axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer treatment. We evaluated pain and cutaneous sensitivity in the ICBN dermatome of patients in which the nerve was preserved during the axillary dissection. METHODS: we carried out a prospective cohort study of 77 patients divided into: NP group (n= 34), patients without ICBN preservation, and ICB group (n= 43), patients in which the nerve was preserved. Cutaneous sensitivity was evaluated one year after surgery using 1) a modified McGill Pain Questionnaire; 2) clinical examination including brachial perimetry and evaluation of pain and tactile sensitivity; 3) Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments which allow an objective, qualitative, and quantitative evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions. RESULTS: pain was more frequently reported in the NP group (23 / 33) than in patients from the ICB group (17 / 42); p= 0, 012. Painful sensitivity was preserved {{in the majority of}} patients from the ICB group (38 / 42) but in only 11 / 33 patients from the NP group (p< 0, 01). There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of lymph nodes dissected between the two groups (p= 0, 06). CONCLUSIONS: patients with ICBN preservation had less pain and more preservation of cutaneous sensitivity, with no decreased number of axillary lymph nodes removed during the axillary dissection...|$|E

La sintomatología se evidencia en la esfera cognitiva, motora y psicosocial y en cómo las personas con demencia procesan los estímulos. Objetivo: Revisar los principios y métodos de la integración sensorial y su influencia en el sistema nervioso central, para ser aplicada a personas mayores con demencia tipo Alzheimer. Método: Se expone el fundamento teórico y la aplicación de la integración sensorial a través de las cinco etapas del enfoque. Resultados: La primera etapa pretende alertar los sistemas sensoriales y centrar la atención a través de un estímulo olfatorio, para así iniciar la segunda etapa, en la que la estimulación sobre el sistema propioceptivo y <b>táctil</b> cobra relevancia. En {{la tercera}} etapa la integración perceptual favorece la conservación de habilidades visoespaciales dirigidas a la cognición, área que se trabaja en la siguiente etapa. Finalmente, el estímulo gustativo y la relajación que se brinda dan lugar al establecimiento de relaciones interpersonales y a la adquisición de comportamientos adaptativos. Conclusiones: El uso del enfoque de integración sensorial en personas con demencia tipo Alzheimer requiere más investigaciones mediante estudios experimentales; también una serie de elementos relacionados con las actividades, la rigurosidad, la autoorganización, la adaptación del entorno, la creatividad y la participación motivada de los sujetos y el terapeuta. Introduction: There {{is a clear}} {{functional}} impairment in people with dementia of the Alzheimer's type that affects their daily living, their families, and the environment around him or her. Symptomatology {{is evident in the}} cognitive, motor and psychosocial areas and in the way that people with dementia process stimulus. Objective: To review the principles and methods of sensory integration and its influence on the central nervous system, to be applied to older people with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Method: Explanation of the theory and implementation of sensory integration through the five stages of the approach. Results: The first stage aims to alert the sensory systems, focusing attention through an olfactory stimulus following with the second stage in which the stimulation of the proprioceptive system and touch become relevant. The third stage of sensory integration promotes the conservation of visuospatial abilities in relation to cognition, which is worked on in the fourth stage. Finally, taste stimulus and relaxation provided in the fifth stage leads to the establishment of interpersonal relationships and the acquisition of adaptive behavior. Conclusions: The use and effectiveness of the approach of sensory integration in people with dementia of the Alzheimer's type requires further investigation through experimental studies. The approach requires a number of elements associated with the activities, as well as strictness, self-organization, adaptation to the environment, creativity, and motivated participation of the subjects and the therapist...|$|E
40|$|The tactile {{analogue}} scale (TAS) was elaborated {{to be used}} in blind subjects {{or those}} who can not use the vision during their crises. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize, from TAS, the architecture of migraine attacks in subjects with visual disability. For that, 11 migrainous with visual disturb (MVD) subjects were studied and 22 migrainous subjects with no visual disability as a control group. All patients fulfilled the criteria for migraine and the patients of the group studied showed visual acuteness less than 20 / 200. To evaluate the results, the patients of the group MVD were subdivide within two groups, according to their visual acuteness: subgroup A subjects with subnormal vision and subgroup B amaurotic ones. In subgroup A measurement 46 attacks with average of the migraine attacks of the 56. 50 mm, in the subgroup B 45 attacks with average of the 59. 58 mm and in the control group 92 attacks with average of the 49. 88 mm. When subgroup B and control group were compared there was a significant statistic difference (p= 0. 022). Through these outcomes we can observe that the migrainous subjects with no visual afference show a higher pain intensity during the migraine crises comparing to those subjects with no visual handicap. The study suggests that, as in other forms of sensibility, the total visual loss can also interfere in the nociceptive control of the pain during the migraine attacks. A escala analógica <b>táctil</b> para dor (TAS) foi elaborada para ser utilizada em cegos ou em indivíduos que não podem utilizar a visão durante suas crises. O objetivo deste estudo foi caracterizar, a partir da TAS, a arquitetura das crises de migrânea em indivíduos portadores de deficiência visual. Foram estudados 11 pacientes com deficiência visual e migranosos (DVM) e, como controle, 22 pacientes migranosos sem deficiência visual. Todos os pacientes preenchiam os critérios para migrânea e os pacientes do grupo DVM apresentavam acuidade visual menor que 20 / 200. Para avaliação dos resultados, os pacientes do grupo DVM foram separados em dois subgrupos: subgrupo A, pacientes com visão subnormal e o subgrupo B, pacientes amauróticos. No subgrupo A avaliamos 46 ataques com intensidade média das crises de cefaléia de 56, 50 mm; no subgrupo B foram avaliados 45 ataques com média de 59, 58 mm; no grupo controle 93 ataques com média de 49, 88 mm segundo a TAS. Quando comparados o subgrupo B e o grupo controle, ocorreu diferença estatísticamente significativa (p= 0, 022). Através destes resultados, podemos observar que os pacientes migranosos sem aferências visuais apresentam maior intensidade de dor durante as crises de migrânea em relação a pacientes sem deficiência visual. O estudo sugere que, como em outras formas de sensibilidade, a perda visual total pode interferir nos controles nociceptivos da dor...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} project is {{developed}} {{the design and}} implementation of a temperature control for an industrial oven. It {{is used for the}} dry process of engines’ windings and electrical generators. The implementation of the oven structure is considered by the properties of wall’s materials, thermic isolation and resistive elements that warm up the oven. The total power of the oven is given by the result of the quantity of absorbed heat times of the charge in a determinate time and the loss of heat that are gotten by the radiation, convection and conduction in the walls. To control the internal temperature of the oven a PID control is built, it allows keeping a constant temperature value, {{with the use of a}} PLC (Programmable Logic Control) that controls the function of the system. The HMI (Human-Machine Interface) implemented in a touch screen is used to enter the temperature values of dry and its time of work. Also is showed the condition of the control elements, real temperature value, working time and the register of warnings of produced fails. Using WinCC RT Advanced as software is developed an HMI in the PC for the remote control of the industrial oven and the visualization of the control elements. Besides is possible to watch the graphics of the PID performance and is generated a database on Excel with the warnings, and the on and off times of the oven. En el presente proyecto se realiza el diseño e implementación de un control de temperatura de un horno industrial para el proceso de secado del bobinado de motores y generadores eléctricos. En la implementación de la estructura del horno se toma en cuenta las propiedades de los materiales que conforman las paredes, el aislamiento térmico y los elementos resistivos que calentaran el horno. La potencia total del horno resulta del cálculo de la cantidad de calor absorbido por la carga en un determinado tiempo y de las pérdidas de calor que se tienen por radiación, convección y conducción en las paredes. Para controlar la temperatura interna del horno se realiza un control PID que permite mantener el valor de temperatura constante, mediante la utilización de un PLC (Controlador Lógico Programable) que controla el funcionamiento del sistema. En la Interfaz Hombre-Máquina o HMI implementada en una pantalla <b>táctil,</b> se ingresa los valores de temperatura de secado y tiempo de funcionamiento. También se visualiza el estado de los elementos de control, el valor de temperatura real, el tiempo de funcionamiento transcurrido y un registro de alarmas de fallas producidas. Mediante el software WinCC RT Advanced, se realiza un HMI en la PC para el control remoto del horno industrial y la visualización del estado de los elementos de control. Además se observa las gráficas del comportamiento del PID y se genera una base de datos en Excel para tener un registro de las alarmas, tiempo de encendido y apagado del horno...|$|E
40|$|No son pocos los arquitectos que, tras abrazar la modernidad, encontraron su {{particular}} conversión desde la experiencia <b>táctil</b> y espiritual del material o, incluso, desde la evocación de su memoria y nostalgia. A todos ellos les llegó un momento en el que los tensos planos enfoscados en blanco les parecían de una excesiva abstracción y, sobre todo, distantes de otras realidades materiales por las que sentían una atracción más honda y permanente, y que activaban, simultáneamente, su memoria y las razones espirituales del construir. De hecho, en esa blanca abstracción no se mantuvieron ni sus creadores. Uno de los conversos de más largo recorrido es Barragán y las transformaciones en su obra son deudoras de los múltiples encuentros con los materiales y sus paisajes. After a few {{early years}} {{working in the}} Guadalajara of his birth, Barragán seized a dream opportunity and relocated to Spain’s capital city in 1935. In Madrid he embarked on a productive and successful career, designing multi-dwelling units for private developers for 5 years. During that time, further {{to what he had}} learnt in his travels across Europe, Barragán saw in modern architecture a catalogue of precise postulates with a reproducible vocabulary. All the buildings he authored in that period indisputably drew from modernist precepts. Nonetheless, like other modern architects, including Le Corbusier himself, Barragán experienced the desolation of white abstraction, of inert and repetitive matter: precise and effective perhaps, but unable to engage with the spiritual values nesting in the deep recesses of the architect’s memory. Around 1940 Barragán decided to break with architectural practice. In so doing he redefined it beyond the stylistic limits that had been his reference until then. The source for that redefinition was the encounter with gardens as the material and object of design, along with the strong attraction exerted on the architect by that specific type of matter. The return to stone, wood or traditional rendering arose not only out of a need to evoke his own experience, but of a desire to conjure up in these materials the memory and nostalgia of other cultures. The El Pedregal gardens and adjacent Prieto House, built in 1945 - 1950, constituted a veritable laboratory where Barragán, deploying a materially dense architecture, spawned beauty by uniting landscape and aesthetic expression. In a word, the architect aspired to use matter to express humanity’s emotional link with nature, its ultimate haven. With his oeuvre, Barragán blurred the boundaries between technical and humanistic concerns, sensing in every element, every object, the spiritual reasons for building. As in the Capuchin Convent at Tlalpan (1952 - 1955) and the Gilardi House at Mexico City (19769, with that blurring matter also participates in continuity. Such continuity, converted in his architecture into spatial succession, elicits the feel of a close-knit, changing and uninterrupted sequence. The resulting sleekness is the origin of the joyful, still delight in a work that needs mouldable materials to create that effect. All that together associates memory with the experience of materials. Inherited matter contributes to the generation of timeless and universal architecture, which portrays it not portrayed as the opposite of the spirit but rather, paradoxically, as the vehicle for its expansion...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} double-blind, controlled, split-mouth {{designed}} {{clinical trial}} {{was to assess the}} effect of a single application of Gluma Desensitizer® on alleviating dentin hypersensitivity. Twelve subjects entered the study and ten completed the protocol. Each subject had two teeth treated: one with Gluma Desensitizer® according to the manufacturer's instructions and one with water. The assessment of pain was performed with the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale), after tactile (probe), thermal (cold blast of water) and thermal/evaporative (cold blast of air) stimuli at baseline, immediately after treatment, after 1 week and after 4 weeks. The mean VAS values for the test and control teeth were compared by the paired t test (alpha = 0. 05). Repeated measurements ANOVA was used to compare the different experimental times. The results showed that for test teeth, at baseline, mean VAS values were 1. 76 (± 2. 82), 7. 10 (± 2. 10) and 4. 75 (± 2. 65), and, after 4 weeks, the mean values were 1. 70 (± 2. 31), 5. 50 (± 3. 30) and 4. 61 (± 3. 14), respectively for probe, water and air stimuli. For the control teeth, at baseline, the mean VAS values were 1. 86 (± 2. 92), 6. 61 (± 2. 31) and 4. 08 (± 2. 91) and, after 4 weeks, 2. 66 (± 3. 07), 6. 32 (± 2. 94) e 4. 76 (± 3. 26). There were no statistically significant differences between test and control teeth at any time. No intra-group differences were demonstrated either. It was concluded that Gluma Desensitizer® had no effect on hypersensitive teeth from periodontally treated patients for a period up to 4 weeks. O objetivo deste estudo clínico duplo-cego, controlado, de boca-dividida foi avaliar o efeito de uma aplicação única do Gluma Desensitizer® no alívio da hipersensibilidade dentinária. Doze sujeitos participaram do estudo, sendo que destes dez completaram o estudo. Cada um dos participantes teve dois dentes tratados, um com o Gluma Desensitizer®, de acordo com as orientações do fabricante, e o outro com água. Para a avaliação da dor foi utilizada a EVA (Escala Visual Analógica), após os estímulos <b>táctil</b> (sonda), térmico (jato de água frio) e térmico/evaporativo (jato de ar frio) no início do experimento, imediatamente após o tratamento, uma e quatro semanas após. Os valores médios encontrados na EVA foram comparados pelo teste-t pareado (alfa = 0, 05). Para os diferentes tempos experimentais utilizou-se ANOVA para medidas repetidas. Os resultados mostram que, no início do tratamento, os valores médios foram de 1, 76 (± 2, 82), 7, 10 (± 2, 10) e 4, 75 (± 2, 65) para os dentes teste e, após quatro semanas, os valores médios foram de 1, 70 (± 2, 31), 5, 50 (± 3, 30) e 4, 61 (± 3, 14) respectivamente para os estímulos sonda, água e ar. Para os dentes controle, no início do tratamento, os valores médios segundo a EVA foram de 1, 86 (± 2, 92), 6, 61 (± 2, 31) e 4, 08 (± 2, 91) e, após 4 semanas, 2, 66 (± 3, 07), 6, 32 (± 2, 94) e 4, 76 (± 3, 26). Não ocorreram diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre os dentes teste e controle em nenhum dos tempos experimentais. Também não ocorreram diferenças intragrupo. Concluímos que o Gluma Desensitizer® não tem efeito sobre a hipersensibilidade dentinária de pacientes periodontalmente tratados num período de até quatro semanas...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} many reasons that aim to include people with special necessities, like those with visual deficiency, in the world of work, education, and in the society as a whole. However it is {{observed}} that when we talk about schooling inclusion, especially in High School, there is a huge gap between the theory and the practice. The lack of didactic resources, the inadequate installations, unprepared teachers, the families´ lack of information, are some of the factors that hinder the process of inclusion. Furthermore, the educators also {{have to deal with the}} roughness of the disciplinary contents and, refering to the study of Chemistry, with the use of signals related to this subject´s language. So, the objective of our research is to reflect about the apprehension of this language by the visually handicapped people, and try to contribute with their process of inclusion in the school life. On this perspective we work with the Periodic Table, which constitutes one of the indispensable tools necessary to the Chemistry learning. In order to acomplish it, the way followed by us happened in three passages. Initially, by means of a semistructured interview, we tried to get acquainted with the blind students opinion, who were participating in the research about the Periodic Table used by them throughout High School, as well as the dificulties felt when using it. After getting the answers, the Table was reelaborated to fill those students´necessities. Here, two new Tables were designed, one in Braille which shape is more compacted, and another made with high printed dots, built with sand and glue. On the third moment, the new designed Tables were tested by the students and, by means of a semi-structured interview, we tried to identify if this new resource would solve the problems concerned to the old Table. The students showed that the compacted Tables would facilitate the touch reading of the chemical elements simbols, making it clear and fast. We hope that, with the elaboration of this learning tools we can contribute with one of the elements to favor the effective participation of blind students in Chemistry classes, when studying the Periodic TableNa atualidade, inúmeras são as razões que visam à inclusão de pessoas com necessidades especiais, dentre essas, aquelas com deficiência visual, no mundo do trabalho, na educação, e na sociedade como um todo. Entretanto, observa-se que em se tratando da inclusão escolar dessas pessoas, especialmente no Ensino Médio, há um enorme distanciamento entre a teoria e a prática. A falta de recursos didáticos, as instalações físicas inadequadas, o despreparo dos professores, a desinformação das famílias, são alguns dos fatores que emperram o processo de inclusão. Além disso, os educandos deparam-se também com a aridez dos conteúdos disciplinares e, no caso do estudo da Química, com a utilização dos signos relativos à linguagem que é concernente à matéria. Logo, o objetivo de nossa pesquisa é refletir sobre a apreensão dessa linguagem pelas pessoas com deficiência visual, com vistas a contribuir para o seu processo de inclusão escolar. Nessa perspectiva, trabalhamos com a Tabela Periódica, que se constitui em uma das ferramentas indispensáveis para apropriação do conhecimento químico. Para tanto, o percurso metodológico adotado foi realizado em três etapas. Inicialmente, por meio de uma entrevista semi-estruturada, procurou-se conhecer a opinião de alunos cegos, participantes da pesquisa, sobre a Tabela Periódica que utilizaram no Ensino Médio, bem como as dificuldades sentidas no seu manuseio. A partir das respostas obtidas, a tabela foi re-elaborada para atender às necessidades destes alunos. Nessa etapa, foram construídas duas tabelas, uma em Braille cuja forma é mais compacta, e a outra em alto relevo, confeccionada com areia e cola. Na terceira etapa, as tabelas elaboradas foram submetidas a análise dos participantes e por meio de entrevista semi-estruturada procurou-se identificar se esse recurso atendia às solicitações feitas pelos alunos quanto ao manuseio. Os participantes sinalizaram que as tabelas compactas facilitavam a leitura <b>táctil</b> dos símbolos dos elementos químicos de forma mais ágil e clara. Espera-se que, com a elaboração dessas ferramentas, possamos contribuir com mais um dos elementos a favorecer a participação efetiva de alunos cegos nas aulas de Química, ao estudar a Tabela Periódic...|$|E
