[...] She compared this to previous models (the technological imperative, strategic choice, and technology as a trigger) and considered the importance of meaning, power, norms, and interpretive flexibility. Orlikowski later replaced the notion of embedded properties for enactment (use). The [...] "practice lens" [...] shows how people enact structures which shape <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> that they employ in their practices.

50|$|The Self-review Framework is {{an online}} tool that {{schools in the}} United Kingdom can use to assess and {{benchmark}} <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> (ICT).

It is designed to support ALL schools. It complements the work schools currently undertake for Ofsted and can be provided as evidence for a school’s Self Evaluation Framework (SEF).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a large {{longitudinal}} survey <b>of</b> students and <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in two Australian universities. The SEET survey is unique in Australia because it includes not just current use, but students' expectations about <b>their</b> future <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology.</b> The survey was originally run in 2010 and then repeated, with slight modifications to reflect changes in technologies, in 2013. This paper compares the results from 2013 with the 2010 results. Whilst some changes reflect the wider access to freely available open resources and new technologies such as Smartphones and iPads, other results are remarkably consistent with the 2010 results. Overall students are increasingly satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> and despite the increase in uptake <b>of</b> freely available <b>technologies,</b> {{it is evident that}} the LMS and its inbuilt tools and functions remain a key platform for learning and teaching at universities. 12 page(s...|$|R

30|$|With {{reference}} to the second question attempted in this research i.e. the obstacles that learners encountered. The findings showed some barriers that influence the attitudes of participants and impede <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> online resources and the Internet in learning the English language. The barriers were classified into three groups, namely, the lack of equipment, lack of skills, and lack of motivation. The most influential obstacles that were identified by the subjects as shaping their reactions and restricting <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> computer <b>technologies</b> were external barriers, such as the lack of equipment and skills. These two types of barriers {{are related to the}} extent that affected learner’s stands and restricted <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> computer <b>technologies.</b> These two barriers were attributed to the external or physical environment. Nevertheless, the barriers that affected the attitudes of the participants and restricted <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> were essential barriers, including the lack of motivation. However, the last group ‘motivation’ had low effect on the attitudes of the participants and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> computer <b>technologies.</b> This clearly refers to the positive inner aspects that participants have, in addition to the encouragement given to the participants for the employment <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in learning English.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} parents have {{invested}} heavily in providing their children with technologies at home {{in order to support}} their present and future educational activities. UK education policy has encouraged parents to help <b>their</b> children <b>use</b> these technologies to support their learning, but within a broader social context of growing anxiety about issues of Internet safety, and the unreliability of knowledge taken from the Internet. This paper draws on recent research within a large-scale mixed methods project looking at a range of issues relating to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in the home for learning, in order to explore the ways in which parents try to balance the sometimes contradictory roles <b>of</b> being both <b>technology</b> providers and technology regulators, {{and the ways in which}} young people act in response.

40|$|Purpose. This article {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of 26 assistive technology (AT) users having a range of physical impairments as they optimized <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> in the workplace. Method. A qualitative research design was employed using in-depth, open-ended interviews and observations of AT users in the workplace. Results. Participants identified many factors that limited <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> such as discomfort and pain, limited knowledge of the technology 2 ̆ 7 s features, and {{the complexity of the}} technology. The amount of time required for training, limited work time available for mastery, cost of training and limitations of the training provided, resulted in an over-reliance on trial and error and informal support networks and a sense of isolation. AT users enhanced <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> by addressing the ergonomics of the workstation and customizing the technology to address individual needs and strategies. Other key strategies included tailored training and learning support as well as opportunities to practice using the technology and explore its features away from work demands. Conclusions.
