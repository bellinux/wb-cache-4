5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
5|$|BuroHappold {{has also}} {{completed}} <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> {{a number of}} cardboard structures, notably the Japan Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hanover with Shigeru Ban and Frei Otto, consisting of a gridshell of paper tubes (the structure was reinforced with steel in order to comply with fire regulations, though the tubular structure was itself structurally sufficient). The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban {{on a number of}} other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff.|$|E
5|$|Conran was {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> Norman Bel Geddes, an industrial designer who did work for the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair and designed exhibits for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Geddes also designed an Airliner#4 that was to fly from Chicago to London.|$|E
40|$|Four design {{projects}} were completed at Auburn University this year under {{the sponsorship of}} the NASA/Universities Space Research Association Advanced <b>Design</b> Program. <b>The</b> topics discussed are <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a high speed civil transport; <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a 79 passenger, high efficiency, commercial transport; <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a low cost short takeof vertical landing export fighter; and <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> an ozone monitoring vehicle...|$|R

5|$|In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association {{surveyed}} {{its members}} and other flag enthusiasts on <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. Members ranked the Washington state flag 47th out of the 72 flags surveyed, with a score of 4.53 points out of 10. Washington's flag was criticized for its complicated seal, use of lettering, and similarities to other U.S. state flags that used seals on solid colors.|$|E

5|$|Municipalities {{can also}} adopt flags of their own. <b>The</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> the city flags {{are similar to}} the prefectural flags: a mon on a monocolored background. An example is the flag of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture: the city symbol is {{composed}} of the Katakana character ア (a) and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered on a white flag, with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Terraces {{of shops}} were {{built around the}} fringes of the estate, both to cater for the {{residents}} of Noel Park and for residents of the expanding suburb of Wood Green and the users of the adjacent railway station. <b>The</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> the terraces varied, from short terraces of small shops on the edges of the less-visited eastern portions of the estate, to parades of large shops on Wood Green High Road near the railway station.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the Royal Albert Hall (built in 1867–1871 to <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> Francis Fowke and Henry Young Darracott Scott) is embellished with a mosaic frieze composed of sixteen separate designs by multiple artists. This was assembled from 800 slabs prepared by attendees of the South Kensington Museum's mosaic class; the terracotta was manufactured by Minton, Hollins and Company. The designs are listed below in anti-clockwise order from the north.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a project whose {{aim is to}} find better methods for <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> buildings like laboratories, office buildings, schools, hospitals etc., which have complex mechanical systems. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanical infrastructure in such buildings {{is as important as}} <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> other architectural or construction parts. The fundamental idea of the project is to integrate <b>design</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanical system into <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architectural and structural concepts of the entire building. This is {{based on the belief that}} using an expert system containing computer programs for <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> <b>design</b> problems can support <b>the</b> whole <b>design</b> process and that <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> buildings having complex mechanical infrastructure can be qualitatively better and more efficient than <b>the</b> <b>design</b> with traditional method...|$|R

5|$|This {{came to an}} {{end when}} a new county prison was built in the grounds of the castle's former bailey. The new prison was built by G. Byfield between 1807 and 1811 with an {{innovative}} octagonal structure, influenced by <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> the prison reformer John Howard; the castle gatehouse was then destroyed {{to make way for a}} new county court building.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued {{to experiment with}} equipment and techniques, altering <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic travel. In the era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment—although sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis came to power, {{the design}} was given priority. Despite initial {{competition}} from the Henschel Hs 123, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, the German aviation ministry) turned to <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, the double vertical stabilizers were introduced to give the rear gunner a better field of fire. The main, and {{what was to be}} the most distinctive, feature of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.|$|E

Optical models needed in <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> camera systems, dielectric properties needed in <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> radar systems, and thermal properties needed in <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft thermal control system are included...|$|R

5|$|As he {{developed}} the series, Kishimoto created the three primary characters {{as a basis for}} <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{a symbol}} of the Punic-Phoenician goddess Tanit, all {{pavement}} motifs are typically Hellenistic Greek in origin, although some pavement mortars used with tesserae designs betray some Italian influence. Although the three major ethnic groups of Delos included Greeks (largely of Athenian origin), Syrians/Phoenicians, and Italians/Romans, it is very likely that many of these Italians were Italiotes, Greek-speaking natives of Magna Graecia in what is now southern Italy. Delian inhabitants of either Greek, Italian, and Syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households, but Vincent J. Bruno asserts that <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to Greek artistic traditions.|$|E
5|$|By 1844, Albert {{had managed}} to modernise the royal {{finances}} and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a private residence for their growing family. Over {{the next few years}} a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> Albert and Thomas Cubitt. Albert laid out the grounds, and improved the estate and farm. Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; his model farm at Windsor was admired by his biographers, and under his stewardship the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.|$|E
