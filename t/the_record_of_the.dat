40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe. Using the {{plentiful}} archival fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{civil and}} ecclesiastical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Pula, {{in this article}} author analyses <b>recorded</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively not numerous groups of people, such as Gipsies, mentally retarded, blind, physically disabled and mute persons. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Pula Gipsies are mentioned under the term Cigalo, Cingano, Cingaro and Zingaro. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages one <b>of</b> them is mentioned two times at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times {{in the seventeenth century}} and eight times in the eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased they are mentioned 13 times: fi ve times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century. Mentally disabled persons are rarely <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> sources, too – only 11 times. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages they are not mentioned at all, but in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decea-sed <b>the</b> most <b>of</b> them are mentioned. Blind persons are mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased only two times (both in the eighteenth century), and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is documented (in the nineteenth century). Similarly, in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is <b>recorded.</b> By <b>the</b> same token, only one physically disabled person is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased (in the mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation (in the nineteenth century). Likewise, one mentally retarded boy is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased in the mid eighteenth century. Mute persons are mentioned 4 times: once in <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century and three times in <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century. To sum all, Gipsies and variously disabled persons are recorded 36 times: 21 recordings in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased, 11 notes in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> baptisms, and two times in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages. Although these social groups represent a small percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permanent or temporary population of Pula, one can notice that their presence contributed to <b>the</b> social life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city...|$|R

5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{give credit}} to Colonel Noel Parrish, Commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946, for his enlightened leadership and fair treatment of cadets which improved morale by {{reducing the amount of}} segregation and overcrowding and improving relations with both blacks and whites in the town of Tuskegee. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Airmen became a driving force for President Harry S Truman's decision to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century notable {{photographic}} work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations for the work of Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in {{the early twentieth}} century.|$|E

Cragh's resurrection was one of thirty-eightmiracles presented to the papal commissioners who in 1307 were charged with examining the evidence for Cantilupe's saintliness. The hanged man himself gave evidence to the commission, after which nothing more is known of him. Cantilupe was formally canonised by Pope John XXII on 17 April 1320.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1969 and 1970 Montreal Junior Canadiens in {{the playoffs}} was so {{outstanding}} it caused a change in Memorial Cup eligibility rules. Previously, all Junior clubs in Canada were eligible for the cup, but the Junior Canadiens beat a club from Prince Edward Island so badly {{in the playoffs}} that 'Junior A' was re-organized into 'Major Junior' and 'Junior A'. Since then, only Major Junior clubs are eligible for the Cup.|$|E

5|$|When Karl {{became a}} {{hurricane}} on November 25, the 1980 season became notable for having two November hurricanes; {{the other was}} Jeanne. This tied 1932 and 1969 for <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most November hurricanes, which was later accomplished during the 1994 season. Later, 2001 broke this record with three hurricanes. The cyclone never affected land, and as a result, no deaths or damages occurred. One ship to the northwest of Karl's center recorded 35mph (55km/h) winds and an air pressure of 993 mbar.|$|E
5|$|In 1624, a {{fatality}} occurred {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman, Edward Tye, {{who was trying to}} hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first Laws of Cricket were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.|$|E
5|$|In the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19–90) {{which set}} {{not only the}} Test record for best match figures but also the {{first-class}} one. In taking 10–53 in the second innings {{he became the first}} bowler to capture all ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian Leg-spinner Anil Kumble is the only other bowler to have taken 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10–74 against Pakistan in 1999. West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier. Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq holds <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fastest test half century scoring 50 runs from 21 balls. The record for the fastest test century is held by New Zealand's Brendon McCullum who scored 100 runs from 54 balls in his final test match.|$|E

On 9 May, Totti scored from a penalty in a 2–1 away defeat to Milan, equalling Roberto Baggio for <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most goals scored in Serie A from penalties (68). On 31 May, in the final match-day of the 2014–15 season, he scored his 299th goal for Roma in a 2–1 home defeat to Palermo. Totti finished the season as Roma's leading scorer with ten goals in all competitions, the seventh time in which he had been the team's top scorer.|$|E

5|$|The club {{also hold}} {{the record for}} winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League twelve times {{and for the most}} semi-final {{appearances}} (28). As of April 2016, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 98goals in total, 82 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70. Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide. The same season the team tied the win-streak for games in the Champions League, with ten.

5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone {{with the}} Wind {{set a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. Gone with the Wind also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for Gone with the Wind is just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, Gone with the Wind lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E
