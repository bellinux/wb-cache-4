5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E
50|$|Consistent with choice blindness, Henkel and Mather {{found that}} people are easily {{convinced}} by false reminders that <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> different options than <b>they</b> actually <b>chose</b> and that <b>they</b> show greater choice-supportive bias in memory for whichever option <b>they</b> believe <b>they</b> <b>chose.</b>|$|R

In chapter 36, High states that valkyries serve drinks and {{see to the}} tables in Valhalla, and Grímnismál stanzas 40 to 41 are then quoted in {{reference}} to this. High continues that the valkyries are sent by Odin to every battle, where <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> who is to die, and determine victory.|$|E
5|$|Jagadish, {{a captain}} in the Indian Army, returns to Mumbai from Kashmir. On his arrival, his parents and younger sisters force him to see Nisha, who <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> {{for him to be}} married to. At the bride-viewing ceremony, Jagadish makes up excuses to avoid marrying her, which {{includes}} commenting about her being old-fashioned. On the contrary, Nisha is a college-level boxer, who is completely modern in her outlook. Jagadish realises this and proposes to her, which after initial refusal, she reciprocates.|$|E
5|$|Sole tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli {{brought the}} medium, soft and supersoft tyres to the event, continuing the trend {{established in the}} Australian, Bahrain and Chinese Grands Prix. Per the regulations of the 2016 season, every driver needs to set aside one set {{each of the two}} softest compounds for the race and one set of the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The drivers have freedom of what other compounds <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} other formats used for bouldering {{competitions}}. Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each {{problem with a}} timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors can use their allotted time however <b>they</b> <b>choose.</b> In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed {{amount of time to}} complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.|$|E
5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as <b>they</b> <b>choose.</b> Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E

5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved if <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> to receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{development}} for the game began with a small team in 2009. During this phase, the unique gameplay mechanic of Link merging onto walls was prototyped. However, development suffered several setbacks with production of the game ceasing entirely in late 2010, as core team members were reassigned to different projects. A year later, development restarted and after several failed pitches to series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, the game entered full production in 2012. Changing the established conventions of the series became a goal for the game's designers; {{this led to a}} change in the game's structure, allowing players to tackle and clear the majority of dungeons in any order <b>they</b> <b>choose,</b> and the introduction of the item rental system.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E

5|$|One month later, Jupiter {{visits the}} narrator and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has been bitten by the bug and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that the bug will {{be the key to}} {{restoring}} his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed {{at the end of one}} branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops the bug through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig. Finding nothing there, Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull's other eye; <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. <b>They</b> <b>choose</b> {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

Around June 18, a small delegation of Ottoman leaders demanded the Shkodrans surrender, offering peace and rewards if <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> to comply and threatening torture and execution if <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> to resist. On behalf of all the Shkodrans, Peter Pagnanus refused the offer with threats of his own.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. <b>They</b> <b>choose</b> the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. <b>They</b> <b>choose</b> cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those cases that are denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E
5|$|The race saw the {{competitive}} début of Pirelli's new ultrasoft tyre compound, which was provided alongside the supersoft and soft compounds. Per the regulations of the 2016 season, every driver needs {{to set aside}} one set {{each of the two}} softest compounds for the race and one set of the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The drivers have freedom of what other compounds <b>they</b> <b>choose</b> for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets. From this race onwards, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile allowed drivers to choose alternative helmet designs for one race weekend per season, a practice usually prohibited as they have to wear the same design to make them more recognisable to spectators and television audiences. As a consequence, Felipe Massa's helmet featured extensive artwork by graffiti artist Os Gêmeos, teammate Valtteri Bottas featured casino-inspired imagery and Haas driver Romain Grosjean sported a tribute to the late Jules Bianchi on his helmet. The race marked a reason for celebration at McLaren, as the team had started their first ever Grand Prix at Monaco fifty years earlier.|$|E
