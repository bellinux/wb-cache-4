5|$|McNary's running mate, Willkie, died {{eight months}} later. It {{was the only}} time both members of a major-party presidential ticket died during the term for which <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> election. At the time of his death, McNary held the record for longest-serving senator from Oregon, a record he kept until 1993, when Mark O. Hatfield surpassed his mark of 9726 days in office.|$|E
5|$|The badge {{has been}} subject to various {{revisions}} through the years, meaning that the club was unable to register it as a trademark.

5|$|The resounding Australian {{victories}} {{gave the}} England selectors many problems as <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> {{to find a}} combination that could challenge the tourists' superiority. As a result, England used 21 players in all, while Australia only used 15, {{one of which was}} forced by injury. Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests, while England only had seven such players.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} {{persistent}} vegetative state is frequently misdiagnosed, and that the reasons for withdrawal of life support from a patient should be scrutinized since even family member surrogates can have conflicts of interest.

5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{their own}} recording studio, the duo immediately {{started working on}} new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and studio equipment, as <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. Having dropped out months before graduation, André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens.|$|E

At the time, around 60% of city's 15,000 inhabitants were Armenians. His family was part of the Catholic minority of Javakhk Armenians, most of whom were followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church. His ancestors came from Erzurum {{in the aftermath of a}} Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. Fleeing Ottoman persecution, <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> refuge in the Russian Caucasus. He lost his father, Harutyun, at an early age.|$|E
5|$|As the Angolan Civil War {{began to}} take on a {{diplomatic}} component, in addition to a military one, two key Savimbi allies, The Conservative Caucus' Howard Phillips and the Heritage Foundation's Michael Johns visited Savimbi in Angola, where <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> to persuade Savimbi to come to the United States in the spring of 1989 to help the Conservative Caucus, the Heritage Foundation and other conservatives in making the case for continued U.S. aid to UNITA.|$|E
5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E

5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. <b>They</b> <b>sought</b> recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that {{police officers}} had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} Stone Rollin at Blakeslee Recording Company, his {{recording studio}} complex in Los Angeles, California. He spent approximately one year {{working on the}} album, including writing its music and lyrics. He worked on the album's production with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt. The two shared an interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques, which they had applied in recording The Way I See It. However, for Stone Rollin, <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> to eschew its predecessor's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style, in keeping with Saadiq's other musical projects.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Adams {{emerged as}} an {{important}} public figure in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). The British Parliament found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> to directly tax the colonies of British America for the first time. This tax dispute {{was part of a}} larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Changi Murals are {{a set of}} five {{paintings}} of biblical theme painted by Stanley Warren, a British bombardier and prisoner-of-war (POW) interned at the Changi Prison, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II (WWII).

With a message of universal love and forgiveness, they helped to uplift {{the spirits of the}} POWs and sick when <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> refuge in the prison chapel.|$|E
5|$|The French Republican {{position}} {{became increasingly}} difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés agitated for {{support of a}} counter-revolution. From their base in Koblenz, adjacent to the French–German border, <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria and its allies. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her. Portugal and the Ottoman Empire also joined the alliance against France.|$|E

5|$|The French Republican {{position}} {{became increasingly}} difficult.

5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor and sexually {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained {{when they had to}} keep up with the deluge of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go over their heads. The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrims were Brownist English Dissenters; <b>they</b> <b>sought</b> {{a version}} of the Christian {{religion}} without things they deemed nonessential, such as bishops or Christmas. They differed from the Puritans; the Pilgrims were stricter, and instead of seeking to reform the Church of England from within, sought to separate themselves from it. They had left England for the Netherlands because in 1608, King James I began to persecute Separatists. Among those who fled then was William Bradford.|$|E
