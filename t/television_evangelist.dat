During Carlson's administration, U.S. Assemblies of God churches increased from 10,582 to 11,689.

2500|$|In 1979, Lewis {{switched}} to Elektra and produced the critically acclaimed Jerry Lee Lewis, although sales were disappointing. [...] In 1986, Lewis {{was one of}} the inaugural inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. [...] Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam {{at the end of the}} evening, which was immediately incorporated into the event. [...] That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like John Fogerty to create the album Class of '55, a sort of followup to the Million Dollar Quartet session, though in the eyes of many critics and fans, lacking the spirit of the old days at Sun. [...] In 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock & roll, Great Balls of Fire!, brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred Dennis Quaid as Lewis, Winona Ryder as Myra, and Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra, and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he co-wrote called [...] "It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)" [...] was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie Dick Tracy. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on a radio. [...] The public downfall of his cousin, <b>television</b> <b>evangelist</b> Jimmy Swaggart, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star Mickey Gilley. All three listened to the same music in their youth, and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart have had a complex relationship over the years.|$|E

However, not all critics were impressed with this album. For example, a writer in Entertainment World called Norman [...] "a hermaphrodite" [...] and wrote [...] "Faith can move mountains, so it may move this incredible hunk of hubris". while another, who described Upon This Rock as [...] "a musical misery tour", and wrote: [...] "God didn't give Larry Norman a voice — a recording contract, but not a voice". Another reviewer wrote: [...] "In [...] "Ha Ha World," [...] Neil Young's [...] "Mr. Soul" [...] is thinly and lethargically evoked. Ditto a Jim Morrison effect on [...] "The Last Supper." [...] And shades of Art Garfunkel on the ballad [...] "I Wish We'd All Been Ready".|$|R

50|$|The {{network was}} founded by Pat Robertson as the CBN Satellite Service, an arm of his {{television}} ministry, the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN). When the channel launched on April 29, 1977, it became the first basic cable channel to be transmitted via satellite from its launch and, effectively, the first national basic cable-originated network (TBS - which began transmitting via satellite in December 1976 - originated as a feed of broadcast television station WTCG (later WTBS and now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta, Georgia; the national version of the channel did not exist until 1981, when the Turner Broadcasting System launched a separate feed of WTBS for distribution to cable systems outside the Atlanta market containing national advertisements). Initially, the network offered only religious programs aimed at a Christian audience. The offerings on the CBN Satellite Service during its early years included CBN's flagship news/talk show, The 700 Club (which aired three times per day every Monday through Friday in the late-morning and at night), along with programs from many notable and lesser-known <b>television</b> <b>evangelists.</b> As a result, a few televangelists began to produce stripped programs to air on the network each weekday. The CBN Satellite Service grew its subscriber base to 10.9 million households by May 1981.|$|R

40|$|Throughout American history, {{religion}} and entertainment have influenced {{each other and}} have intersected in fascinating ways. Native American rituals and games entertained and inspired. Early white settlers like the Puritans, though defining their faith over and against profane pastimes, engaged in sport, play, and elaborate storytelling. Still, stark contrasts appeared in the 17 th and 18 th centuries {{when it came to}} how Catholics and Protestants in the New World thought of the theater, music, and performance. The evangelical surge in the 18 th century brought with it a lively and riveting preaching style—represented by celebrity ministers like George Whitfield and Gilbert Tennent—that faced the ire of their more traditional foes for using “vulgar” methods to reach the masses. In the 19 th century, African Americans, in slavery and freedom, expressed their faith in ways that combined religious systems, dancing, and music traditions from Africa and the Americas. Evangelical churches and prominent figures used entertainment to proselytize, illustrate the drama of salvation and damnation, and to enliven services. Temperance, anti-slavery, and other reformist groups employed music, novels, and theater to spread their earnest message. Pentecostals and other evangelicals took up new forms in the 20 th century. They eagerly made use of radio, film, and later, <b>television.</b> The well-known <b>evangelist</b> Billy Graham was a skillful pioneer of new media. In the 20 th century, Hollywood films drew on Jewish and Catholic themes, as Jewish and Catholic writers, directors, and actors put their stamp on the silver screen.
