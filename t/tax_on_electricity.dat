50|$|The New Mexico Supreme Court {{issued a}} ruling in 1978 {{and found that}} the state energy tax was valid.

The tax amounted to about 2 percent of the retail value of electricity. The Act further allowed electric companies in New Mexico to credit the amount of this tax against their existing tax liability from an existing 4 percent gross receipts tax on retail sales of electricity, essentially eliminating {{the effect of the}} tax upon New Mexico's in-state users of electricity.

50|$|Legislators {{considered}} {{legislation that}} would remove or lower income taxes, making up for the lost revenue with an increased sales tax. McCrory distanced himself from this proposal, which was criticized by Art Pope, his deputy budget director, as being regressive. According to legislative analysts, the reform passed will result in some families, retirees and small business owners seeing a tax hike. All taxpayers have had to pay some additional sales taxes due to expansions of the tax to some services and higher sales <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>electricity.</b> The largest income tax breaks has gone to higher-income earners as it replaced a three-tier progressive income tax with a flat tax. The changes reduced state revenue by $2 billion over 5 years, despite McCrory's previous insistence that any reform had to be revenue-neutral. After earlier predictions of a revenue shortfall because of tax reform, North Carolina instead had a $400 Million revenue surplus for Fiscal Year 2014-2015, because personal income growth was more robust, and lower tax refunds were paid out due to more accurate payroll withholding. The tax law changes through 2014 resulted in 55 to 60 percent of taxpayers having a tax decrease, 10 to 15 percent seeing no change, and 30 to 35 percent having a tax increase.|$|E
40|$|The supply {{security}} {{of fossil fuels}} {{is one of the}} most important policy issues in South Korea. This is because of South Korea&# 39;s economic condition, geopolitical status, and lack of energy resources. This study investigates the Korean public&# 39;s perceptions of the supply {{security of}} fossil fuels using the contingent valuation method. It derives the Korean public&# 39;s willingness to pay (WTP# for policy measures that enhance the supply security of fossil fuels, such as overseas energy development and strategic reserves. It also compares the WTP in terms of an increase in taxes on gasoline or diesel with the WTP in terms of an increase in the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>electricity.</b> The results demonstrate that the WTP will increase if the Korean public&# 39;s understanding of the importance of policy measures that boost the supply security of fossil fuels as well as the role of government in implementing these measures are enhanced. The comparison of the WTP shows that the Korean public will be less against an increase in the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>electricity</b> than an increase in the tax on gasoline or diesel. This is so even though the WTP amount for a tax increase on electricity is smaller than that for a tax increase on gasoline or diesel. #C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{economic model}} of efficient competitive markets {{relies on the}} ability of sellers to charge prices that vary as their costs change. Yet, there is no restructured electricity market in which most retail customers can be charged realtime prices (RTP), prices that can change as frequently as wholesale costs. We analyze the impact of having some share of customers on time-invariant pricing in competitive electricity markets. Not only does time-invariant pricing in competitive markets lead to outcomes (prices and investment) that are not first-best, it even fails to achieve the second-best optimum given the constraint of time-invaraint pricing. We then study a number of policy interventions that have been proposed to address the perceived inadequacy of capacity investment. We show that attempts to correct the level of investment through <b>taxes</b> or subsidies <b>on</b> <b>electricity</b> or capacity are unlikely to succeed, because these interventions create new inefficiencies. We demonstrate that the most common proposal, a subsidy to capacity ownership financed by a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> retail <b>electricity,</b> is particularly problematic. In contrast, an increase in the share of customers on RTP improves efficiency, though it does not necessarily reduce capacity investment. We demonstrate that the analysis is robust to inclusion of a simple form of reserve capacity...|$|R
50|$|Finland was {{the first}} country in the 1990s to {{introduce}} a CO2 tax, initially with few exemptions for specific fuels or sectors. Since then, however, energy taxation has been changed many times and substantially. These changes {{were related to the}} opening of the Nordic electricity market. Other Nordic countries exempted energy-intensive industries, and Finnish industries felt disadvantaged by this. Finland did place a border <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> imported <b>electricity,</b> but this was found to be out of line with EU single market legislation. Changes were then made to the carbon tax to partially exclude energy-intensive firms. This had the effect of increasing the costs of reducing CO2 emissions (p. 16).|$|R

40|$|In many countries, {{entry of}} {{renewable}} electricity producers {{has been supported}} by subsidies and financed by a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>electricity</b> consumed. This article {{is the first to}} analytically derive the dynamics of the generation mix, subsidy, and tax as renewable capacity increases. This enables us to complement and extend previous work by providing analytical expressions for previously obtained simulation results, and deriving additional results. The analysis yields three main findings. First, the subsidy to renewable may never stop, as the value of the energy produced may decrease faster than the cost as renewable capacity increases. Second, high renewable penetration leads to a discontinuity in marginal values, after which the subsidy and tax grow extremely rapidly. Finally, reducing the occurrence of negative prices, for example by providing renewable producers with financial instead of physical dispatch insurance, yields significant benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{rebound effect}} {{refers to the}} {{phenomenon}} that energy savings from improvements in energy efficiency are lower than expected due to unintended second-order effects. Grasping specific mechanisms related to the rebound effect requires {{a good understanding of}} interactions between heterogonous agents on multiple markets. Otherwise, policies aimed at reducing energy use may render counter-expected and unforeseen consequences. In this paper, we propose a formal model, where technological change results from interactions on two markets: between consumers and producers in the market for final goods, and heterogeneous power plants in the electricity market. The analysis provides insights to the role of technological change, supply-demand coevolution, and status-driven consumption in explaining the rebound effect. The model is employed to compare effectiveness of economic policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions associated with production of consumer goods, namely: a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>electricity</b> and "nuclear obligations" to produce ten percent of electricity from nuclear energy.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis is to identify appropriate approach to evaluation of impacts of {{the first phase of}} the ecological tax reform in the Czech Republic, its consequent adaption and application for the particular purpose. The input-output analysis has been found as the most convenient solution for such a sort of analysis. The analysis has been used for the evaluation of impacts on final production prices of each NACE sector resulting from introduction of new <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>electricity,</b> solid fuels, natural gas and some other kinds of gases in the Czech Republic. Because of unavailability of information about the final impact of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> particular objects in the economy, the analysis is conducted on the basis of five incidence assumptions about the impact of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> distributors and customers. While the aforementioned analysis is the essential chapter of the thesis, the work starts with a theoretical introduction related to optimal tax theories and theories about possible positive effects of environmental tax implementation. Additionally, energy tax implementation in the Czech Republic and in the European Union is mentioned. Furthermore, an important starting point in finding the most convenient model was to summarize various approaches to modelling energy <b>tax</b> impacts <b>on</b> the economy. Therefore, theoretical description of particular models is provided when history of the models, type of equations and dependences in the model are described. Moreover database requirements and possibilities to use the model for another purpose are discussed. The thesis also comprises of the analysis of pros and cons and additional important characteristics of relevant models together with the summary for which purpose was the particular model used in the Czech Republic. The introduction of energy tax in the Czech republic on the final production prices was proved to be unimportant and with only exceptions (namely the sector of production and distribution of electricity, natural gas and water) an increase in final production prices does not exceed 0, 2 % and for a half of all the sectors the increase does not exceed 0, 1 %...|$|R
