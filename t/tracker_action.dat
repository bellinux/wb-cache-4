5|$|A {{key action}} which {{physically}} connects {{the keys and}} the windchests is a mechanical or <b>tracker</b> <b>action.</b> Connection is achieved {{through a series of}} rods called trackers. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding tracker pulls open its pallet, allowing wind to enter the pipe.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{was totally}} reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, {{retaining}} the existing instrument {{as far as}} was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than {{the sides of the}} case. New 75percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress {{from the bottom of the}} case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted <b>tracker</b> <b>action</b> to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.|$|E

25|$|The organ dated {{from about}} 1881 was by Engelfried & Hadden. It was played by {{mechanical}} action with two manuals, 35 stops and 45 ranks. Lynnwood Farnam, noted concert organist {{of the early}} 20th century, visited the church on November 27, 1919, and wrote {{in one of his}} notebooks that the organ was a fine old piece in very bad condition, located west gallery, had <b>tracker</b> <b>action,</b> and electric blowing.|$|E
25|$|The Gallery Organ {{is easily}} {{recognised}} from its unusual asymmetric façade – only the central organ case is original, {{the left and}} right wings added by Navaratnam. The action, once electropneumatic, was converted to direct-electric. This caused occasional problems with non-sounding notes and ciphers, resulting from the ingress of dirt into an open building and the general humidity. In the latest rebuilding of the organ, a new <b>tracker</b> <b>action</b> was built to replace the electric action. It is to date, the oldest playable organ in Singapore and is still regularly used for Masses.|$|E
50|$|The organ on the church's eastern gallery {{was built}} in 1981 by organ builder Metzler (Dietikon, Switzerland). The organ has 50 stops (3536 pipes) on three {{keyboards}} and pedals. In addition to the main console, the organ also has a figured bass console in the lower section of the positive organ with a pedal attached. Tjos console is independent of the main console so that two organ players can play music on two organ consoles. The organ has mechanical and registered <b>tracker</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new research project, {{which aims to}} reveal the elements of haptic sensation in playing pipe organ with mechanical <b>tracker</b> <b>actions.</b> In order to reach this goal sets of experiments will be carried out. Layout of these experiments are (1) measuring manual key signatures and analyzing them together with the interviews with expert organists to study the extent they can feel and communicate key properties, (2) measuring dynamical properties of key action, recording sound and recording organist’s movements simultaneously during performance, and (3) running psychophysical experiments on expert organists using an experimental keyboard where key action can be simulated and altered. The outcome of this research project will contribute to organ building and documentation and new class of haptics-enabled digital musical instruments...|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the Walcker organ {{was in such}} poor {{condition}} that a new organ was commissioned. The job of building a new organ in the gallery over the entrance went to Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The new organ was consecrated in 1979. It has three manuals (like the Walcker organ), over 44 registers, mechanical <b>tracker</b> key <b>action</b> and electrical stop action.|$|R
25|$|During the 2013-16 {{restoration}} and {{renovation of the}} Cathedral, the gallery organ was completely dismantled and rebuilt by the organ builders Diego Cera of the Philippines. The organ was dismantled and shipped to the Philippines and revoiced and repaired while the cathedral was closed. The organ was provided with a new console and a new <b>tracker</b> <b>action,</b> while the original organ case was restored and extended. One no longer sees the asymmetrical facade, as all the pipe work was re-organized into the new case. The organ is also playable from a remote console located in the south transept, where the choir is now located. The cherubs and Saint Caecilia statue were not reinstalled after the restoration.|$|E
25|$|For a {{mechanical}} <b>tracker</b> <b>action</b> and its couplers to operate under these higher wind pressures, pneumatic assistance {{provided by the}} Barker lever was required, which Cavaillé-Coll included in his larger instruments. This device {{made it possible to}} couple all the manuals together and play on the full organ without expending a great deal of effort. He also invented an ingenious pneumatic combination action system for his five-manual organ at Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris. All these innovations allowed a seamless crescendo from pianissimo all the way to fortissimo, something never before possible on the organ. His organ at the Basilique Ste-Clotilde, Paris (proclaimed a basilica by Pope Leo XIII in 1897) {{was one of the first}} to be built with several of these new features. Consequently, it influenced César Franck, who was the titular organist there. The organ works of Franck have inspired generations of organist-composers who came after him.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tracker</b> <b>action</b> {{has been}} used from antiquity to modern times. Despite the extra effort needed in playing, many organists prefer <b>tracker</b> <b>action</b> because of a feel and a control of the pipe valve operation. Before the pallet opens, wind {{pressure}} augments tension of the pallet spring, but once the pallet opens, only the spring tension is felt at the key. This provides a [...] "breakaway" [...] feel.|$|E
25|$|After {{the advent}} of {{unification}} and the electro-pneumatic action, builders of church organs started to see the advantages of these systems. As a result, several organ builders began adopting these concepts for use in their church organs. Among these were Austin, Möller, Aeolian-Skinner and Kimball, who used electro-pneumatic action in many of their organs. Today, approximately one fourth of all new or rebuilt church pipe organs use an electro-pneumatic action either exclusively, or as an augmentation to existing <b>tracker</b> <b>actions.</b> In the same vein, some amount of unification was utilized in some church organs, and even today many church pipe organs utilize some degree of unification in areas where it is not critical to the classical sound sought in such instruments, or in instruments where space for pipes is limited. With stops such as the 32' bourdon in the pedal division, or a 16' reed in a manual division, the basic theatre organ concept of extension is commonly—but discreetly—used by even the most noted organ builders.|$|R

50|$|The cathedral has two organs. One is a {{historical}} <b>tracker</b> <b>action</b> pipe organ, {{the other is a}} digital instrument. The <b>tracker</b> <b>action</b> organ was built in 1976 by Hendrik ten Bruggencate and was inspired by the Swiss firm Metzler Orgelbau.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} awareness {{around the world}} of the influence of CO 2 on climate change. In 2009, domestic transportation accounted for 27 % of global final energy consumption and the USA had the largest CO 2 emissions with 1. 6 Gt, followed by China with 456 Mt. Both countries pledged under the Copenhagen Accord to reduce their CO 2 emissions until 2020. The target of the USA is to reduce emissions by 17 % under 2005 levels. China plans a reduction of 40 - 45 % below 2005 levels per unit of GDP. This study focuses on these two countries and assesses the CO 2 reduction potential of current and planned policies in the domestic transport sector in 2020 and whether the reduction is in line with the pledges. Further, it compares the policy strategies of the two countries and identifies gaps in the current policy strategies {{with the help of the}} Climate <b>Action</b> <b>Tracker</b> model. The Climate <b>Action</b> <b>Tracker</b> model uses evaluation against best practice and was further developed during the research. Both countries show similarities in their policy strategies, having fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles and focusing on high speed rail and electric vehicles. Current and planned policies in China have a reduction potential of 68 Mt CO 2 in 2020. Filling the policy gaps has a reduction potential of 420 Mt CO 2. The corresponding values for the USA are 268 and 949 Mt CO 2. With a conservative assumption for the Chinese GDP development, the upper end of the target range of the pledge (45 %) is exceeded by 2 % without further policy action. The policy impact exceeds the pledge by 7 %, the reduction potential by 31 %. Policies in the USA lead to a reduction of 21 % below 2005 levels by 2020. The reduction potential is 58 % below the 2005 levels. To fulfil the pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, this gives the other sectors a little buffer...|$|R

40|$|Automated video {{surveillance}} {{is a field}} in rapid expansion. Our research goal {{is to build a}} 3 D person tracker for indoor {{video surveillance}}. In order to put our work in context we review various vision-based techniques for tracking people and detecting abnormal behaviours. The approaches are presented in bottom-up fashion starting from low-level algorithms to segment foreground objects, to <b>trackers</b> and <b>action</b> recognition systems. We also present a model-based camera localization technique. Our contribution is a 3 D tracking system that can be subdivided into three modules: background subtraction, camera pose estimation and the tracker itself. The background subtraction algorithm uses the Discrete Cosine Transform coefficient blocks of JPEG encoded images as observations to compute the most likely state of each block with a Hidden Markov Model. Camera pose estimation is implemented as an edge-based CAD model registration technique using a particle filter. Finally, the tracker uses the registered model to perform 3 D tracking from monocular images by assuming that the feet of people touch the floor. It's able to estimate the position and speed of tracked people at 2 Hz, the maximum frame rate of the network camera. This tracker is in fact a blob-based tracker combined with a particle filter estimator. Preliminary results demonstrate that this system works well in its application context: hallway monitoring. Existing systems that use the output of trackers to recognize activities are reviewed. Finally we propose a few ideas on how to use a 3 D tracker to classify scenes in order of interest with the most unusual first...|$|R
40|$|Household robots need {{to perform}} tasks {{specific}} for the owner. With Learning from demonstration (LfD) a robot can learn new tasks from human demonstrations, without requiring programming skills. This thesis investigates a novel representation of actions {{that can be}} learned by using only a 3 d camera and an object <b>tracker.</b> The <b>action</b> representation is objectbased so it is independent of the morphology of the robot. The actions are represented using the average and standard deviation of multiple demonstrated trajectories with six degrees of freedom. The standard deviation serves as a weight factor for the required accuracy of the recognized or synthesized trajectory. Three novel methods proposed in this thesis aim to reduce variances in the demonstration that are not specific to the action. First the demonstrations are aligned in time using a novel action signature and a novel time warp algorithm. The time warp algorithm can approximate the alignment of multiple multidimensional signals in quadratic computing time. The third novel technique is a dynamically optimized choice of reference frame so variations in start and end position have little influence on the variance in trajectory. This method has been tested on a database of five actions repeatedly demonstrated by six subjects. The results show {{that it is possible}} to have a 90 percent action recognition rate with only three demonstrations in the database. It is also shown that a robot can use this action representation to synthesize four out of five actions with varying object positions.

Some have proposed alternative scenarios to achieve the 2  °C goal, because INDCs based on emissions have led to scenarios with a temperature rise larger than 2  °C. Some assessments have made comparisons with the recent Fifth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR 5) scenario database (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis 2015 a), and made allocations based on the multiple effort sharing schemes. The consensus among the assessments at this stage is that current INDCs are not {{in line with the}} 2  °C goal, which was also stated in the PA (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2015). To achieve the 2  °C goal, either a further emissions reduction before 2030, or more drastic and quick reductions after this date are required.|$|R

50|$|Perhaps the best-developed {{evolution}} of the IDEF model beyond Toyota was at Boeing. Their project life-cycle process {{has grown into a}} rigorous software system that links people, tasks, tools, materials, and the environmental impact of any newly planned project, before any building is allowed to begin. Routinely, {{more than half of the}} time for any given project is spent building the precedence diagrams, or three-dimensional process maps, integrating with outside suppliers, and designing the implementation plan-all on the computer. Once real activity is initiated, an <b>action</b> <b>tracker</b> is used to monitor inputs and outputs versus the schedule and delivery metrics in real time throughout the organization. When the execution of a new airplane design begins, it is so well organized that it consistently cuts both costs and build time in half for each successive generation of airframe. And, of course, it is paperless. Boeing created a complex lean management process called 'define and control airplane configuration/manufacturing resource management' (DCAC/MRM). The process was built with the help of the operations research and computer sciences departments of the University of Pittsburgh. The manufacture of the Boeing 777 was ultimately a success, and it became the precursor to succeeding generations of CALM at Boeing. Boeing is four generations beyond that airplane now, and they have succeeded in cutting the time and cost for each new generation of airplane. Boeing’s successes in conversion from inefficient silos of manufacturing to a lean and efficient operation have become legendary.|$|R
