The Branch was established to co-ordinate <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> staff of Commonwealth departments, to reduce Commonwealth reliance on the State police forces for assistance with investigations and to become the channel for communicating with State Departments for assistance with investigations. A separate Victorian Office was then established. The Security Service established in 1941 assumed some duties of <b>the</b> <b>Investigation</b> Branch on 17 March 1942 and in Victoria the Security Service, Victoria, took over these duties from the Victorian Office of <b>the</b> <b>Investigation</b> Branch. <b>The</b> Security Service was disbanded on 15 December 1945 and its activities and records were absorbed by a Security Section created within <b>the</b> <b>Investigation</b> Branch.

5|$|Boletopsis nothofagi is {{a genetically}} clearly {{differentiated}} {{representative of the}} genus Boletopsis, which according to <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> of Cooper and Leonard separated relatively early from the precursor of most other known species. Only a North American species, B.leucomelaena, branches off from their phylogenetic tree even earlier. However, the relationships between many of the species were not fully resolved in the study, so in the future, new species may be described.|$|E
5|$|Hoover {{directed}} the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC {{as it was}} established (it {{did not have a}} full-time executive director until 1960). <b>The</b> <b>investigations</b> were largely superficial until 1962, when the FBI learned that one of King's most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, Wilmot {{retired from}} public life {{and moved to}} Bruce Castle to write his memoirs of the American Revolution and his role in <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> of its causes and consequences.

(According to Foucault torture could occur during <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> because partial proofs meant partial guilt. If the torture failed to elicit a confession then <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> was stopped and innocence assumed. A confession legitimized <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> and any torture that occurred.) ...|$|R

5|$|In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by {{a margin}} of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state {{legislature}} to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{investigated}} the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7WTC. <b>The</b> <b>investigations</b> examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how {{fire protection systems}} might be improved in future construction. The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E

50|$|As {{the crash}} {{occurred}} within the French territory, the BEA {{was responsible for}} <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b> <b>The</b> BEA sent two field investigators to the crash site and later sent four investigators to Pointe-à-Pitre on 25 March. As the aircraft was manufactured in Canada, the Canadian TSB (Transportation Safety Board) joined <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> with <b>the</b> assistance from Bombardier and Pratt and Whitney Canada. The American NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) also joined <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> and sent a correspondent for <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two reservist {{officers}} {{appointed by}} Military Police Commander Brigadier General Roni Benny {{to examine the}} military police's conduct during <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> determined that investigators acted unprofessionally and with negligence. The two officers criticized {{the decision not to}} appoint a special investigation team led by higher-ranking, more experienced officials and also noted that the incident was not appropriately documented by <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b> <b>The</b> military police officer in charge of <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> was reprimanded and the head of <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> team was censured.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Crist’s office {{began to}} {{investigate}} the Lou Pearlman case. [...] Jacqueline Dowd, who was leading <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> resigned and John MacGregor, who ended <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> in 2004, replaced her. In 2006, Les Henderson criticized Crist’s handling of the Lou Pearlman scouting network and <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Virginia Military Institute and Harvard Law School, Lansdale was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1933. He was called up for active duty in June 1941, and was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Investigations</b> Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (military intelligence) of the War Department General Staff. He became involved with the Manhattan Project in 1942, eventually becoming Brigadier General Leslie Groves's special assistant for security.

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of <b>the</b> <b>{{investigations}}.</b> Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Virginia Military Institute, Lansdale joined the United States Army Reserve. He was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant in the field artillery branch in 1933, and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1937. He was called up for active duty in June 1941, {{a few months before}} the United States entered World War II, and was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Investigations</b> Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (military intelligence) of the War Department General Staff.|$|E

5000|$|According to a {{statement}} by prosecutors [...] "At <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> was halted, Governor Walker was not a target of <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b> At no time has he been served with a subpoena", {{and that they have}} [...] "no conclusions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge anyone with a crime". To date, no one has been charged in <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b> <b>The</b> probe has been effectively shut down with Judge Peterson's quashing of subpeonas until the Wisconsin Supreme Court rules on whether <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> was legal.|$|R
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro's first {{full-time}} political job came in , {{when she}} was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York, by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon. Grumblings {{that she was the}} beneficiary of nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in <b>the</b> <b>Investigations</b> Bureau. The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children. She was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court Bar in 1978.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages of <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> there were over 1,000 Garda {{officers}} attached to <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> making it one of <b>the</b> largest criminal <b>investigations</b> ever undertaken {{in the history of the}} state.|$|R
