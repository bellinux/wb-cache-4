In 9 out of 18 cases, the cause of <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> on laboratory investigations was urinary tract infection (6) and tuberculosis (3).

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of sonographically demonstrated <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> in detecting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Methods. Ethical approval from the Ethical Committee of Clinical Center University of Sarajevo and parental consent were obtained for this prospective study involving 120 children with history of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Ultrasound examination included the evaluation of the urinary tract, with a special emphasis on evaluation of <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation.</b> Voiding urosonography (VUS) was carried out according to a standard protocol with the use of ultrasound contrast agent Sono Vue of second generation. Ureteral diameter greater than 3 mm was considered pathological. Proven VUR was graded into one of three stages. Results. Infectio tracti urinarii recidivans was referral diagnosis in the majority of patients. The average age of patients was 4. 33 ± 3. 88 years (from 2 months to 16 years of age). VUS findings were normal in 59 (49. 2 %), and pathological in 61 (50. 8 %) patients. Statistical analysis showed significant correlation between type and grade of VUR. Our data confirmed predominance of VUR in females and in children under the age of 5. Statistically significant correlation between <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> and the existence of VUR was found, with relatively high sensitivity (67. 2 %), specificity (81. 4 %), and high positive (78. 8 %) and negative predictive value (70. 6 %), total diagnostic accuracy of 74. 2 % in detecting VUR, and significantly increased probability (20 – 25 %) of detecting VUR in patients with sonographically confirmed <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation.</b> Conclusion. Sonographically confirmed <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> can be used as a predictor of VUR in children with UTIs, and in combination with other predictors, might find a place in an evidence-based selective strategy in children with suspected VUR.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Our aim was {{to compare}} {{unenhanced}} helical CT and excretory urography {{in the assessment of}} patients with renal colic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-three of 70 consecutive patients with acute signs of renal colic were prospectively examined with unenhanced helical CT, which was followed immediately by excretory urography. Two radiologists who were unaware of the findings independently interpreted these examinations to determine {{the presence or absence of}} ureteral obstruction. On all CT scans that had positive findings <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones or obstruction, were looked for secondary signs of obstruction (perinephric or periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation,</b> and blurring of renal sinus fat). RESULTS. A stone was recovered in 45 of the 53 patients, nine before and 36 after imaging. The latter 36 patients had their stones identified on CT, whereas only 24 patients had their stones identified on excretory urography. Eight patients without stone disease had normal ureters on both CT and excretory urography. Of the 45 patients who had stone disease 26 had <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> on both CT and excretory urography, and 36 patients who recovered a stone after CT had secondary signs of obstruction. Of the nine patients who recovered a stone before CT, three had secondary signs of obstruction. Two patients had periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, and renal sinus fat blurring. One patients had only ureteral wall edema. CONCLUSION. Compared with excretory urography, unenhanced helical CT is better <b>for</b> identifying <b>ureteral</b> stones in patients with acute ureterolithiasis. Secondary CT signs of obstruction, including renal sinus fat blurring, were frequently present even when the stone was eliminated before imaging. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A 41 -year-old male {{presented}} at Emergency Department (ED) with right flank pain associated with hematuria for 3 days. Patient had a previous history of nephrolithiasis. The physical examination and blood tests were normal. Urine analyses showed haematuria > 1. 000. 000 /μL. After clinical evaluation, a computer tomography (CT) showed right <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> {{caused by a}} 5 mm proximal stone and a distal intraluminal mass of 8 cm in length. In this setting, an ureteroscopic biopsy was performed and revealed a large polypoid lesion histologically suggestive of fibroepithelial polyp. Due to technical difficulties (intraluminal mass length and technical issue for the passage of guidewire) and after discussing all available minimally invasive options, we opted for a laparoscopic approach. Instead of ureterectomy of the affected segment of the ureter, as classically performed, we proceeded with an ureterotomy, blunt dissection of the tumor and ureterolithotomy, with complete removal of the mass. This approach did not require ureteral anastomosis and the <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> facilitated its primary closure. No complications occurred, even after 3 years of follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} {{leads to}} a diagnosis of moderate or high grade (III or higher) vesicoureteral reflux in approximately 15 % of children. Predicting reflux grade III or higher would {{make it possible to}} restrict cystography to high risk cases. We aimed to derive a clinical decision rule to predict vesicoureteral reflux grade III or higher in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of prospective series including all children with a first febrile urinary tract infection from the 8 European participating university hospitals. RESULTS: A total of 494 patients (197 boys, reflux grade III or higher in 11 %) were included. Procalcitonin and <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> on ultrasound were significantly associated with reflux grade III or higher and then combined into a prediction model with an ROC AUC of 0. 75 (95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 81). Given the prespecified constraint of achieving at least 85 % sensitivity, our model led to the clinical decision rule, for children with a first febrile urinary tract infection cystography should be performed in cases with <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> and serum procalcitonin level 0. 17 ng/ml or higher, or without <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> (ie ureter not visible) when serum procalcitonin level is 0. 63 ng/ml or higher. The rule had 86 % sensitivity (95 % CI 74 - 93) with 47 % specificity (95 % CI 42 - 51). Internal cross-validation produced 86 % sensitivity (95 % CI 79 - 93) and 43 % specificity (95 % CI 39 - 47). CONCLUSIONS: A clinical decision rule was derived to enable a selective approach to cystography in children with urinary tract infection. The rule predicts high grade vesicoureteral reflux with approximately 85 % sensitivity and avoids half of the cystograms that do not find reflux grade III or higher. Further validation is needed before its widespread use...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Diuretic renal scan is {{preferred}} noninvasive investigation in evaluating upper urinary tract function and assessing upper tract dilatation or obstruction. Timing of diuretic {{administration is not}} universally standardized in renography. In the present study we compared F- 15, F+ 20 diuretic renography protocols in patient with upper urinary tract dilatation. Methods: From Feb 2004 to Aug 2009, 48 patient were referred with flank pain and pyelocalyceal system <b>dilatation</b> without <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> in ultrasonography IVP or retrograde pyelogram, F- 15 and F+ 20 diuretic renal scans with TC-EC(Ethyiene dicysteine) were performed. Renal function data renograms were recorded and patients were undergone conservative or surgical therapy and followed up with physical exams and IVP or diuretic renal scan after 6 months and then we compared the results with two diuretic renal scan protocols. We used marginal homogeneity test to compare renograms and paired t-student test to compare renal function in two protocols. Results: Among 48 cases, 32 were male and 16 were female. Mean age were 17. 8 &plusmn; 23 years. Ultrasound showed pyelocalyceal <b>dilatation</b> without <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation,</b> delayed pyelogram. The results were equivocal in 11 cases (22. 91 %) of F+ 20 scans whereas they had complete obstructive pattern in F- 15 scans. 6 cases (12. 58 %) had nonobstructive pattern in F+ 20 but equivocal or obstructive pattern in F- 15 scans. Obstructions were diagnosed in 31 cases (64. 56 %) of patient by F+ 20 scan and in 43 cases (91. 44 %) by F- 15 scan. Renal split function didn't change in both F- 15 and F+ 20 protocols. Conclusion: According to equivocal results of F+ 20 diuretic renal scans, F- 15 can reduce equivocal results of F+ 20 diuretic renal scans.

40|$|Purpose: Here {{we report}} {{the results of}} a review of a prospectively {{maintained}} database of the use polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer (PPC) injection to correct grades IV and V VUR. Materials and methods: All children with grades IV and V primary VUR that presented with febrile urinary tract infection while on prophylaxis, in a three -year period, were treated with a subureteral injection of PPC. Institutional ethical approval was obtained. Exclusion criteria were incomplete bladder emptying documented on videourodynamic study, ureteral duplication, paraureteral diverticula and poor ureteral emptying observed during fluoroscopy and previous open surgical or endoscopic treatment. Pre- and post-operative evaluation included urinalysis, renal and bladder ultrasonography, DMSA scan and videourodynamic studies. Results: 33 children (36 renal units) were included with a median age of 57 months (range 7 to 108). There were 18 males and 15 girls. 30 renal units had grade IV and 6 grade V VUR. Median follow-up time was 32 months (range 7 to 58). Reflux was cured in 32 / 36 renal units with the first injection, but another 2 patients were reimplanted because of dilatation. Complications included early urinary tract infection in 7 children, transient lower urinary tract symptoms in 5 children. Progressive <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> was noted in 4 children and was treated with insertion of a double J stent. Two of these children eventually required an ureteroneocystostomy. Conclusions: The use of PPC to treat grades IV and V vesicoureteral reflux in young children has an overall success rate of 83, 3 %. Persistent <b>ureteral</b> <b>dilatation</b> was present in 11 % associated with high injection volume.

Results: Similarity in stone clearance rate and treatment time between the two procedures; overall procedural time, analgesia requirement and total cost were significantly different. Renal colic and gross hematuria were more frequent with ESWL while voiding symptoms were more frequent with ureteroscopy. Both procedures used <b>for</b> <b>ureteral</b> stones ranging from 8 to 15 mm were safe and minimally invasive. Conclusion: ESWL remains first line therapy <b>for</b> proximal <b>ureteral</b> stones while ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy cost...|$|R
40|$|A 46 -year-old man {{underwent}} total cystectomy and Indiana pouch urinary diversion for bladder {{cancer in}} 2001. Pathological examination revealed an urothelial {{carcinoma of the}} bladder (pT 2 N 0 M 0). He was referred to our hospital for bilateral hydronephrosis in June 2009. Cytological examination of the urine was negative. Percutaneous nephrostomy was performed, and we suspected bilateral ureteral tumors from pyelo-ureterography. Percutaneous ureteroscopy revealed a papillary tumor in the right ureter. Since {{there appeared to be}} a papillary tumor in the left ureter, we decided to perform ureterectomy <b>for</b> bilateral <b>ureteral</b> tumors, and to keep the bilateral nephrostomy <b>tube</b> <b>for</b> urinary diversion. Pathological examination revealed urothelial carcinoma in bilateral ureters. There has been no sign of recurrence at 17 months after the operation...|$|R
