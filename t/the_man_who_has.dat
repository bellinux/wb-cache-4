5|$|In this episode, Millennium Group {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) must {{track down}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> kidnapped his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher).

5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels with}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and {{daughter}} Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) to visit Catherine's parents in Arlington County, Virginia. Also present are Catherine's sister Dawn (Barbara Williams and her husband Gil. In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent that this is <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens to}} a shot of an {{abandoned}} office, where the main character (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift aircraft. The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in, which is surrounded by a desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. <b>The</b> <b>Man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery. Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft.|$|E
60|$|He {{studied it}} for a few minutes in {{thoughtful}} silence. He looked at the picture of <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> taken <b>the</b> course being fawned upon by lovely women, while <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> let this opportunity slip stood outside the group gazing with a wistful envy.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{recognized}} him. He was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> so unweariedly {{taken the}} part of [...] "The Enemy" [...] in the games at Standing Rock. Primeau {{had told him that}} I was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> given him <b>the</b> money, and he now accepted me as a friend.|$|R

25|$|Her last romantic {{relationship}} was the Russian-French painter Antoine Tzapoff. About him, Félix said: I don't know if he's <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> most loved me, but he's who has loved me better.|$|E
25|$|The Promise - Methos (played by Peter Wingfield) {{recounts the}} story of his life, and of his {{greatest}} love, as he tracks down <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> tormented all four horsemen for thousands of years. Written by James Moran.|$|E
25|$|Sons {{are indeed}} a {{heritage}} from the Lord, {{the fruit of}} the womb a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons of one's youth. Happy is <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> his quiver full of them. He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies at the gate.|$|E

6000|$|There could {{surely be}} little doubt about the {{discovery}} that had burst upon me. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> stolen his way into my house, driven by the terror of a temptation that he dared not reveal, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been my unknown rival in the by-gone time, were one and the same! ...|$|R
25|$|The dialectician {{chooses a}} proper soul and plants and sows within it {{discourse}} accompanied by knowledge—discourse capable of helping itself {{as well as}} the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> it happy as any human being can be.|$|E
500|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic {{gave the}} album a mildly {{positive}} review, citing Arjona's {{return to his}} more mainstream style after the [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort" [...] Poquita Ropa. He compared (as did Arjona and other critics) the production values and musical style of Independiente with past albums Animal Nocturno and Historias. Finally, he stated that [...] "Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been behind the boards for {{quite a few of}} Arjona's most popular releases" [...] (referring to Torres' absence from the production of Poquita Ropa).|$|E
500|$|During the war, Cressey {{also wrote}} his second book: Asia's Lands and Peoples: A Geography of One-Third the Earth and Two-Thirds its People, {{published}} in 1944. [...] The book {{was aimed at}} the ordinary American as a general overview of Asia in light of rising American interest in the region due to the war. [...] In the book, Cressey also entered into the debate on how to divide Asia from Europe by arguing that Europe was really {{only one of the}} six regions of Eurasia, the other five being the Soviet Union, East Asia, Southeast Asia, India, and Southwest Asia. Cressey also made the controversial argument in the book that [...] "the key to enduring peace in eastern Asia is a strong China." [...] The book was well received, and Dudley Stamp wrote that it had [...] "the sure touch of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been to see for himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, just as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been wronged {{stood beside}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> wronged him, full of gladness that his {{opportunity}} had come, there {{burst from the}} cathedral tower a sudden clash of bells, and <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> whose opportunity had come, broke his heart and fell back dead, with that mocking smile still playing round his mouth.|$|R

500|$|The ways {{in which}} St Vincent chose to {{communicate}} the rejections often depended {{on the number of}} letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: [...] "I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime." [...] A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: [...] "Although I cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of Captain (name unknown) , there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which I lose no time in acknowledging;" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Puente", {{the lead}} single, {{is the only}} notable exception. It lasts {{eight and a half}} minutes and is divided in three parts. The first is sung mainly with a piano. The second part is a ballad with Caribbean and Latin sounds, with some salsa and Cuban influences. The third mixes salsa and merengue, with Cuban influences. [...] "Puente" [...] resembles Arjona's work on Galería Caribe. This album was the first since Adentro, that Arjona worked without Torres. In Independiente, Arjona {{returned}} to his trademark sound, which Torres helped craft. David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album a somewhat positive review. He compared the production values and musical style of Independiente with those of past albums Animal Nocturno and Historias, stating, [...] "Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona's most popular releases", referring precisely to the absence of Torres in the production of Poquita Ropa.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Alek Keshishian, was filmed in June 1992 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and Malibu Beach. It premiered on MTV on June 30, 1992, {{a day before}} the release of A League of Their Own. The video shows a man viewing a photo album, as Madonna sings in different settings from within the various pictures. Scenes from A League of Their Own also appear on the album during the song's instrumental break. As the video ends, the man having {{reached the end of}} the album, then scrolls backwards through the previous pages. The video was commercially released in 2004 as a bonus feature on the 2-disc special edition DVD of A League of Their Own. According to Rettenmund, unlike most music videos related to film soundtracks, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] did not give emphasis on having shots from the film in the video itself. Instead Keshishian and Madonna chose introspection as the theme, with simple images to portray them. Rettenmund notes, [...] "At the end, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been looking back at his scrapbook of Madonna lays his head down, sealing the video with the perfect bit of sadness to resonate with Madonna's ennui." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé resigns herself and {{continues}} to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Beyoncé continues, [...] "I'd put myself first / And make the rules as I go / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' {{for me to come}} home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Beyoncé stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly. As Beyoncé emphasizes how it feels to be cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did {{in the rest of the}} song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Beyoncé concludes, [...] "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she [...] " [...] her voice into a thin, pleading whine" [...] at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony to bring her down.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{assuming}} the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated {{him from his}} roots: [...] "peasants do not have [...] entirely cultured gifts.... Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much polychromy {{at the expense of}} linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal." [...] The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose. According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was [...] "a supreme artist" [...] whose use of [...] "typical sayings" [...] attests [...] "a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample." [...] These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing {{during the second half of}} the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a [...] "strictly intellectual sensuousness" [...] and the notion that [...] "pleasure arises from gratuitousness", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to [...] "the great secret of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one." [...] In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed [...] "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: [...] "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".|$|E
500|$|The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder's {{apartment}} in disguise {{and tell him}} that they cannot find Scully. They reveal that they have found e-mails between Scully and a man called Cobra, who is apparently working on a shadow project at the Department of Defense. [...] Meanwhile, Scully wakes up in a cabin in Pennsylvania in pajamas instead of her clothes, and accuses The Smoking Man of drugging her. He claims she was merely exhausted and he was trying to make her comfortable. [...] She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers. Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner to figure out why Scully was communicating with Cobra. They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting. The group believe that it is the work of The Smoking Man, but Skinner still does not know how {{to get a hold of}} him. At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the cure for cancer, but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E
6000|$|There they were, half-phantom {{through the}} fog, a silent, foot-dragging, interminable, grey procession. They carried wet, dirty banners, they rattled boxes for pence; these <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not said [...] "snap" [...] {{in the right}} place, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> [...] "snapped" [...] too eagerly, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never said [...] "snap," [...] <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{never had a chance}} of saying [...] "snap." [...] A shambling, shameful stream they made, oozing along the street, the gutter waste of {{competitive}} civilisation. And we stood high out of it all, as high as if we looked godlike from another world, standing in a room beautifully lit and furnished, skillfully warmed, filled with costly things.|$|R

2500|$|In the Justice League Unlimited episode [...] "For <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Has</b> Everything", Krypto {{appears in}} Superman's dream as a pet of {{imagined}} son Van-El. Because {{the dream is}} set on Krypton, Krypto is depicted as having no powers or costume, but he otherwise looks similar to most versions of the character.|$|E
2500|$|His {{opinions}} {{about the future of}} education, many of which were in Future Shock, have often been quoted. An often misattributed quote, however, is that of psychologist Herbert Gerjuoy: [...] "Tomorrow's illiterate will not be the man who can't read; he will be <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not learned how to learn." ...|$|E
2500|$|Archer was satirically {{portrayed as}} a {{misunderstood}} secret agent, saviour of Britain and mankind and [...] "overall thoroughly good chap", by actor Damian Lewis in the BBC drama [...] (2002). Scriptwriter Guy Jenkin explained that [...] "my Jeffrey Archer is <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> frequently saved Britain over the last 30 years. He's beloved of all women he comes across, all men, all dogs— he's a superhero." ...|$|E
