5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core {{is thought to be}} electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing {{because of a lack of}} convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used <b>to</b> <b>reheat</b> the crust.|$|E

25|$|Glassblowing {{involves}} three furnaces. The first, {{which contains}} a crucible of molten glass, is simply {{referred to as}} the furnace. The second is called the glory hole, and is used <b>to</b> <b>reheat</b> a piece in between steps of working with it.

Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.|$|E
25|$|At {{what point}} in the {{building}} process were the bricks hardened by fire? Were the bricks hardened first, and then arranged {{in order to build}} the structures, or were the structures built out of partially hardened bricks, after which the entire structures were heated by fire to finish the hardening of the bricks? The hypothesis that the entire structures were reheated following assembly is supported by evidence that the mortar between the bricks was at some point subjected to high temperatures. The contrary hypothesis is supported by the observation that the structures bear no signs of scarring from large intense fires such as would be needed in order <b>to</b> <b>reheat</b> them as whole.|$|E
25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. <b>To</b> <b>reheat</b> the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces {{and placed in a}} strainer held over a wok of boiling oil.

40|$|Entropy {{production}} from scalar decay {{in the era}} of low temperatures after neutrino decoupling will change the ratio of the relic neutrino temperature to the CMB temperature, and, hence, the value of N_eff, the effective number of neutrino species. Such scalar decay is relevant <b>to</b> <b>reheating</b> after thermal inflation, proposed to dilute massive particles, like the moduli and the gravitino, featuring in supersymmetric and string theories. The effect of such entropy production on the relic neutrino temperature ratio is calculated in a semi-analytic manner, and a recent lower bound on this ratio, obtained from the WMAP satellite and 2 dF galaxy data, is used to set a lower bound of ~ 1. 5 x 10 ^- 23 Gev on the scalar decay constant, corresponding <b>to</b> a <b>reheating</b> temperature of about 3. 3 Mev.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Universe between inflation and the onset of big bang nucleosynthesis is difficult to probe and largely unconstrained. This ignorance profoundly limits our understanding of dark matter: we cannot calculate its thermal relic abundance without knowing when the Universe became radiation dominated. Fortunately, small-scale density perturbations provide a probe of the early Universe that could break this degeneracy. If dark matter is a thermal relic, density perturbations that enter the horizon during an early matter-dominated era grow linearly with the scale factor prior <b>to</b> <b>reheating.</b> The resulting abundance of substructure boosts the annihilation rate by several orders of magnitude, which can compensate for the smaller annihilation cross sections that are required to generate the observed dark matter density in these scenarios. In particular, thermal relics with masses less than a TeV that thermally and kinetically decouple prior <b>to</b> <b>reheating</b> may already be ruled out by Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Although these constraints are subject to uncertainties regarding the internal structure of the microhalos that form from the enhanced perturbations, they open up {{the possibility of using}} gamma-ray observations to learn about the reheating of the Universe.

During this epoch prior <b>to</b> <b>reheating,</b> large-scale magnetic fields can be significantly produced by the cosmo-logical background. By considering magnetogenesis both during and after inflation, we demonstrate that magnetic fields stronger than 10 − 15 G can be generated on Mpc scales without having strong couplings in the theory, or producing too large electric fields that would dominate the universe. ar X i...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of perturbative {{reheating}} on the evolution of the curvature perturbation ζ, in two-field inflation models. We use numerical methods to explore the sensitivity of f_NL, n_s and r <b>to</b> the <b>reheating</b> process, and present simple qualitative arguments to explain our results. In general, if a large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of reheating, it will remain non zero at the end of reheating. Unless all isocurvature modes have completely decayed before the start of reheating, we find that the non-linearity parameter, f_NL, can be sensitive <b>to</b> the <b>reheating</b> timescale, and that this dependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only have a minimum in one direction. For potentials with a minimum in both directions, f_NL can also be sensitive <b>to</b> <b>reheating</b> if a mild hierarchy exists between the decay rates of each field. Within the class of models studied, we find that the spectral index n_s, is fairly insensitive to large changes in the field decay rates, indicating that n_s is a more robust inflationary observable, unlike the non-linearity parameter f_NL. Our results imply that the statistics of ζ, especially f_NL, can only be reliably used to discriminate between models of two-field inflation if the physics of reheating are properly accounted for.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{inflation}} is proposed in which compact extra dimensions allow a graceful exit without recourse to flat potentials or super-Planckian field values. Though bubbles of true vacuum are too sparse <b>to</b> uniformly <b>reheat</b> the Universe by colliding with each other, a compact dimension enables a single bubble <b>to</b> uniformly <b>reheat</b> by colliding with itself. This mechanism, which generates an approximately scale invariant perturbation spectrum, requires that inflation {{be driven by}} a bulk field, that vacuum decay be slow, and that the extra dimension {{be at least a}} hundred times larger than the false vacuum Hubble length.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether Effective Field Theory (EFT) approaches, {{which have been}} useful in examining inflation and dark energy, {{can also be used}} to establish a systematic approach <b>to</b> inflationary <b>reheating.</b> We consider two methods. First, we extend Weinberg's background EFT to the end of inflation and reheating. We establish when parametric resonance and decay of the inflaton occurs, but also find intrinsic theoretical limitations, which make it difficult <b>to</b> capture some <b>reheating</b> models. This motivates us to next consider Cheung, et. al. 's EFT approach, which instead focuses on perturbations and the symmetry breaking induced by the cosmological background. Adapting the latter approach <b>to</b> <b>reheating</b> implies some new and important differences compared to the EFT of Inflation. In particular, there are new hierarchical scales, and we must account for inflaton oscillations during <b>reheating,</b> which lead <b>to</b> discrete symmetry breaking. Guided by the fundamental symmetries, we construct the EFT of reheating, and as an example of its usefulness we establish a new class of reheating models and the corresponding predictions for gravity wave observations. In this paper we primarily focus on the first stages of preheating. We conclude by discussing challenges for the approach and future directions.

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>reheating</b> than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|R

40|$|Cosmological inflation, if it occurred, radically {{alters the}} picture of the `big bang', which would merely point <b>to</b> <b>{{reheating}}</b> at the end of inflation. Moreover, this reheating may be only local, so that inflation continues elsewhere and forever, continually spawning big-bang-like regions. This chapter reviews this idea of `eternal inflation', then focuses on what this may mean for the ultimate beginning of the universe. In particular, I will argue that given eternal inflation, the universe may be free of a cosmological initial singularity, might be eternal (and eternally inflating) to the past, and might obey an interesting sort of cosmological time-symmetry.

40|$|In hybrid {{inflation}} and running mass inflation models {{it is possible}} that the inflaton field will fragment into non-topological solitons, resulting in a highly inhomogeneous post-inflation era prior <b>to</b> <b>reheating.</b> In supersymmetric models with a conventional homogeneous post-inflation era, the dynamics of flat direction scalars are determined by cH 2 corrections to the mass squared terms, coming from the energy density of the Universe combined with Planck-scale suppressed interactions. Here we reconsider the cH 2 corrections for a Universe dominated by inflatonic non-topological solitons. We show that the dynamics in this case are typically equivalent to the case c = 0, even in the vicinity of the non-topological solitons. Thus Affleck-Dine baryogenesis will proceed as in the original c = 0 Affleck-Dine scenario. ...|$|R

However, the effects have not been fully investigated, especially with respect <b>to</b> <b>reheating</b> induced by weaving during single-pass welding. In this work, bead-on-pipe {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW) was conducted on super duplex stainless steel to understand the effect of weaving on the microstructure of weld metal. Microstructural analysis, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and focused ion beam transmission electron microscopy (FIB-TEM) were carried out to investigate the relationship between weaving and microstructural change. The weaving of GTAW produced a dynamic reheated area just before the weld bead during welding. It was revealed that extensive reheated weld existed even after one welding pass, and that the content of the austenite phase in the reheated area was higher than that in the non-reheated area, indicating the existence of a large quantity of intragranular austenite phase. In addition, the Cr 2 N content in the reheated area was lower than that in the non-reheated area. This reduction of Cr 2 N was closely related <b>to</b> the <b>reheating</b> resulting from weaving.
