40|$|Automatic {{control of}} fine coal {{cleaning}} circuits {{has traditionally been}} limited {{by the lack of}} sensors for on-line ash analysis. Although several nuclear-based slurry analyzers are available, none have seen widespread acceptance. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} nuclear sensors are expensive and tend to be influenced by changes in seam type and pyrite content. In this investigation, an image analysis technique is used for on-line determination of ash content in fine coal slurries. The ash content of a flotation <b>tailings</b> <b>stream</b> is correlated to the mean gray level of the slurry. Based on a 90 % prediction interval, an analysis of sensor performance indicates an accuracy of 73 {+-} 4 % ash over a range from 65 - 90 % ash.

40|$|About {{a century}} of {{exploitation}} of the galena-arsenopyrite deposit of Baccu Locci in Sardinia (Italy) has caused a severe, persistent arsenic contamination that extends downstream of the mine for several kilometres.

40|$|The {{non-stoichiometric}} sulfide mineral pyrrhotite (Fe 1 -xS) occurs almost ubiquitously inter-grown {{with the}} principal nickel mineral, pentlandite ((Fe,Ni) 9 S 8). During Ni processing, pyrrhotite is generally rejected to the <b>tailings</b> <b>stream</b> by flotation to produce a low tonnage, high grade (Ni) smelter feed and reduce SO 2 emissions. In this study, the effect of different pyrrhotite flotation rejection strategies (artificial oxidation and TETA: SMBS addition) are evaluated on a magnetic (Ore A) and non-magnetic (Ore B) pyrrhotite ore to determine if either may effectively depress and potentially passivate the pyrrhotite surface during flotation to produce benign tailings without compromising pentlandite recovery. For both ores, the best pyrrhotite rejection (pentlandite/pyrrhotite recovery) was obtained using TETA: SMBS. Differences in the flotation performance of the two ores are considered more a function of BMS content, liberation and ore handling rather than a difference in sulfide passivation from the inherent pyrrhotite mineralogy (magnetic vs non-magnetic pyrrhotite). Pyrrhotite passivation could possibly provide a means of rendering the tailings non-reactive and thus mitigate acid rock drainage (ARD) formation...|$|E

Tailings dams, community and garden soil, and stream sediments were further investigated for mercury fractions using a five step sequential extraction procedure. The concentrations of THg in tailings dams, community and gardens soil were 0. 890 – 6. 755  μg/g, 0. 431 – 0. 968  μg/g and 0. 471 – 1. 019  μg/g, respectively and the concentrations of THg in the sediments obtained from <b>tailings</b> dams, <b>streams</b> and wetlands were 0. 649 – 1. 998  μg/g, 0. 604 – 1. 356  μg/g and 0. 681 – 1. 356  μg/g, respectively.

This paper investigates the rapid processing and cleaning of hydrocyclone overflow coal slurry using two laboratory scale Reflux Flotation Cells in series {{as a means to}} economically beneficiate low quality <b>tailings</b> <b>streams.</b> The Reflux Flotation Cell incorporates a novel arrangement of inclined channels to enhance bubble-liquid segregation, enabling extremely high gas rates and liquid rates per unit of vessel area. Hence, in the first stage, fast flotation is employed to rapidly recover fine coal particles using a feed flux of 11. 4 ± 0. 5 cm/s, up to an order of magnitude increase in the throughput rate over conventional flotation systems. First stage product was then sent to a second stage for counter-current washing using fluidisation wash water to produce a fully deslimed product, having ash percent in agreement with the minimum ash attainable using flotation as determined through tree flotation analysis. The results demonstrate the potential for two-stage Reflux Flotation to deliver high throughput at a high separation efficiency from low quality slurry, with a fivefold reduction in the required vessel footprint, thus overcoming the principal economic deterrent of having to install banks of large-scale flotation cells...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{flotation}} {{system was}} used to process fine coal feeds supplied from coal preparation plants. The system consisted of an inverted fluidized bed arranged above a system of inclined channels. High fluidization (wash water) fluxes were imposed through a distributor enclosing the free-surface, producing strong positive bias of up to 2. 4 cm/s, ideal for desliming. High gas fluxes of up to 2. 6 cm/s, {{in excess of the}} flooding condition, were also imposed. The presence of the inclined channels prevented the entrainment of gas bubbles into the <b>tailings</b> <b>stream.</b> This paper, which is the third in a series, examines, for the first time, the hydrodynamic performance of this system on two actual plant feeds, each known to be difficult to wash. The first feed was a poorly liberated coal with particle size < 260 µm and 69 % feed ash. The second was a well liberated coal with nominal size < 125 µm and 83 % less than 38 µm.

40|$|A model-based {{flotation}} {{control scheme}} is being implemented to achieve optimal {{performance in the}} handling and treatment of fine coal. The control scheme monitors flotation performance through on-line analysis of ash content. Then, based on the economic and metallurgical performance of the circuit, variables such as collector dosage, frother dosage, and pulp level are adjusted using model-based control algorithms to compensate for feed variations and other process disturbances. Recent developments in sensor technology are being applied for on-line determination of slurry ash content. During the ninth quarter of this project, Task 3 (Model Building and Computer Simulation) and Task 4 (Sensor Testing) were nearly completed, and Task 6 (Equipment Procurement and Installation) was initiated. Previously, data collected from the plant sampling campaign (Task 2) were used to construct a population balance model to describe the steady-state and dynamic behavior of the flotation circuit. The details of this model were presented in the Eighth Quarterly Technical Progress Report.

40|$|About {{a century}} of {{exploitation}} of the galena-arsenopyrite deposit of Baccu Locci in Sardinia (Italy) has caused a severe, persistent arsenic contamination that extends downstream from the mine for several kilometres. Differently from As, the contamination of lead in surface waters is only localised in {{the upper part of}} the mine despite very high Pb concentrations in geologic materials (waste rocks, <b>tailings,</b> <b>stream</b> sediments, soils) over the whole Baccu Locci stream catchment The aqueous and solid speciation of Pb in various environmental media of the Baccu Locci system was determined by means of a combined analytical (ICP-MS, SEM-EDX, TEM-EDX, chemical extraction) and thermodynamic approach (PHREEQC). The study has pointed out that relatively little Ph (up to 30 mu g/L) is initially released to surface waters (pH = 7 - 8, Eh = 0. 4 - 0. 6 V) very rapidly due to dissolution of anglesite that is the first product of galena oxidation. Subsequently, Pb is removed (down to 0. 6 mu g/L) by probable sorption onto hydrous ferric oxides (e. g. ferrihydrite) and/or possible precipitation of As-containing plumbojarosite that is the main secondary Pb-bearing phase in stream sediments/tailings along the Baccu Locci stream course, The latter hypothesis is controversial since it is reported from the literature that plumbojarosite is formed under acidic conditions, although there is contrary field evidence as well. Bearing in mind the uncertainties introduced from thermodynamic and analytical data, the solubility calculations indicate strong undersaturation of surface waters with respect to plumbojarosite (SI: - 19. 9 to - 3. 7). On the contrary arsenatian plumbojarosite is at or close to saturation (SI: - 0. 6 to 3. 2) in most surface waters and beudantite is clearly above saturation (SI: 4. 1 to 12. 7). This suggests that the incorporation of As might increase the stability of plumbojarosite, extending it up to near-neutral conditions. As a consequence, Pb is prevented from being released downstream to surface waters, and dissolved Pb concentrations remain definitely below the Italian and WHO limits for drinking waters (50 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L, respectively) ...|$|E

40|$|Many gold {{treatment}} plants have sulphides and coarse particle gangue components that contain gold in their tailings (cyanide leach residues and flotation tailings). Coarse and very fine liberated gold {{may also be}} present in some <b>tailings</b> <b>streams.</b> Two issues usually govern the economics of recovering additional gold from gold occluded in sulphide and gangue particles. The liberation characteristics of the gold in the sulphide and coarse gangue (gold liberation versus grind size) is {{the first and most}} important of the two. If fine grinding can liberate a reasonable amount of the gold, then the next important issue is how effectively these two constituents can be concentrated. Flotation will achieve high sulphide recovery but is usually costly. Selectivity is also an issue because of entrainment. Continuous centrifugal gravity concentration offers a viable solution to the recovery of both sulphides and coarse gangue however selectivity is also likely to be a problem. The possibility of improving concentrate grade by using a Falcon B separator was investigated. This paper describes a program of test work carried out on a gold leach tailings using a laboratory Falcon "B" separator. The program involved three different bowl angles: 10, 12 and 14 degrees and two bowl speeds (giving 250 and 350 G accelerations).

40|$|Metallurgical {{accounting}} for toll treatment smelters pose {{a number of}} challenges. Multiple feed stockpiles have to be accounted for {{as part of the}} monthly recovery estimation. Moreover, multiple metallurgical intermediates make up part of the in-process inventory, which also influence the monthly recovery calculation. Errors propagate from the measurements of volumes, assays, moisture fractions and bulk densities in the various material types through multiple steps up {{to the point where the}} final recovery is calculated. These errors contribute non-linearly to the variance in the final recovery estimate. This paper develops the mathematical formulation for variance propagation in toll smelting operations, including the effect of in-process inventory, assuming measurement biases have been eliminated beforehand. Operational data from a Southern African copper smelter is used for a case study. The method of propagation of variance showed that uncertainties in stockpile assays were the main contributors to variance in the recovery estimate. Variance in the volume and bulk density uncertainties contributed a secondary, yet significant, proportion to the overall recovery variance. It was determined, for the given case study, that the recovery variance depended on the calculation method used and that variance propagation via the two-product formula was smaller than recovery variances calculated via the standard recovery formula. However, the probability that the two product formula will give inaccurate (versus imprecise) results is significantly more due to the practical difficulty of equiprobable sampling of <b>tailings</b> <b>streams</b> from smelter plants (which includes materials such as slags and flue dust).

40|$|The South African {{coal mining}} {{industry}} generates {{large volumes of}} coal ultrafine waste (< 150 microns) each year, with a significant amount being dumped in tailing slurry dams. These slurry dams {{have been associated with}} prolonged pollution and loss of valuable resources. In the two stage flotation process developed at the University of Cape Town, froth flotation is used to both recover coal (stage 1) and remove pyritic sulfur (stage 2) from ultrafine coal waste, resulting in three outputs streams: a saleable coal product, a small volume sulfide-rich stream, and a reduced volume sulfide lean <b>tailings</b> <b>stream.</b> Pre-disposal removal of sulfide sulfur and coal recovery by means of froth flotation is aimed at effectively removing the acid rock drainage (ARD) risk associated with sulfide bearing waste s and at recovering valuable resources respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated the technical feasibility of this process for a number of coal waste types on a laboratory-scale, with results indicating {{that it is possible to}} recover large quantities of useable coal whilst generating a tailings waste stream with a reduced sulfur content and negligible ARD risk. An order of magnitude financial model for a fictitious plant has also been developed, and applied to demonstrate the economic viability for s elected case studies. To date, however, studies on the environmental viability of the process have only focused on the ARD mitigating potential of the two-stage flotation process and little attention has been given to the systemic environmental implication s of the process such as the energy and reagent usage. The research study therefore aims to evaluate the environmental burdens and benefits of the two-stage flotation process, particularly from a South African context, and to compare the environmental performance to the conventional disposal of untreated coal ultrafines. Furthermore, this project aims to establish which stages along the process contribute the most to the environmental burdens of the process and how the variations of the input parameters affect the overall environmental performance of the proposed process. To this end, a life cycle inventory of inputs and outputs was compiled on the basis of the empirical results derived from a previous laboratory-scale case study conducted on a sample of an acid generating ultrafine coal waste from the Waterberg region. Experimental results from the case study, which entailed two-stage flotation (using Naflote 9858 as a coal collector and xanthate (SIBX) as a sulfide collector in stages 1 and 2), and detailed characterisation of the feed and desulfurised tailings, was supplemented with literature information and data from mass and energy balance calculations for a fictitious plant. An environmental impact analysis was subsequently conducted using a combination of Life Cycle Impact Assessment and risk-based impact assessment techniques and criteria. The impact categories selected included climate change, terrestrial acidification, fossil fuel depletion, natural land transformation, aquatic water pollution risk, drinking water quality risk, aqueous acidification, salinity and consumptive water footprint. Aquatic water pollution risk, drinking water quality risk and aqueous acidification impact indicators were calculated by summing up risk potential factors for the constituents of the final disposed waste streams. The rest of the impact categories were calculated by multiplying the inventory result with a characterisation factor developed from impact assessment models The case study results indicated that the simple mentation of the two-stage flotation process results in a notable decrease in eco-toxicity, salinity, consumptive water footprint, metal toxicity, aqueous acidification, fossil fuel depletion and natural land transformation impacts. However, the results al so indicated an increase in atmospheric related impacts (climate change and terrestrial acidification impacts), which has been attributed to the additional energy consumption associated with the two-stage flotation process and the production processes associated with the flotation reagents. Analyses of the process contributions to the individual impact categories for the two-stage flotation process revealed the climate change and terrestrial acidification impact categories to be dominated by the electricity production process and the flotation reagents production process. The sensitivity analyses revealed a higher dependence of the fossil fuel depletion impact category on the percentage coal yield than the electricity consumption of the foreground process. Furthermore the sensitivity analyses indicated a strong dependence of the climate change and terrestrial acidification impacts on the electricity consumption and the SIBX dosage in the foreground process. In the South African context, implementation the two-stage flotation process would result in a significant recovery of coal (approximately 1. 2 million tonnes for every 4 million tonnes dry coal ultrafines lost per annum) and a sulfide-rich product which can be utilised for electricity production and sulfuric acid production respectively, hence promoting resource efficiency. Although higher than in the case of conventional land disposal, the energy used in the two-stage flotation process is infinitesimal compared to the energy recovered in the process through the generation of additional coal, and results in only a 0. 025 % increase in the annual greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of the two-stage flotation would also result in reduced water losses in comparison to conventional land disposal, which is beneficial in the South African context as South Africa is a water scarce region. Lastly whilst the implementation of the two-stage flotation process would result in the reduction of water related impacts associated with acidification, salinization and metal pollution, it might pose a further threat to aquatic life if the xanthate salt reagents are emitted to local water sources. The limitations of the study were mainly associated with the quality of the input and output data, the impact categories and the system boundary and scenario development. The multiple sources of information and the variations in literature of the energy input estimates were noted as a source of uncertainty. The lack of characterisation factors for some of the substances in the system as well as the exclusion of the possibility of utilization of the sulfide-lean stream were also part of the limitations associated with the study. Recommendations for future work include improving the environmental assessment by incorporating various case studies and by incorporating downstream processing as well as optimizing the two-stage flotation process by using less energy and by using less toxic flotation reagents...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{flocculation}} and dewatering {{of mineral}} processing streams containing colloidal clays {{has become increasingly}} urgent. Release of water from slurries in <b>tailings</b> <b>streams</b> and dam beds for recycle water consumption, is usually slow and incomplete. To achieve fast settling and minimization of retained water, individual particles need to be bound, {{in the initial stages}} of thickening, into large, high-density aggregates, which may sediment more rapidly with lower intra-aggregate water content. Quantitative cryo-SEM image analysis shows that the structure of aggregates formed before flocculant addition has a determinative effect on these outcomes. Without flocculant addition, 3 stages occur in the mechanism of primary dewatering of kaolinite at pH 8 : initially, the dispersed structures already show edge–edge (EE) and edge–face (EF) inter-particle associations but these are open, loose and easily disrupted; in the hindered settling region, aggregates are in adherent, chain-like structures of EE and stairstep face–face (FF) associations; this network structure slowly partially rearranges from EE chains to more compact face–face (FF) contacts densifying the aggregates with increased settling rates. During settling, the sponge-like network structure with EE and FF string-like aggregates, limits dewatering because the steric effects in the resulting partially-gelled aggregate structures are dominant. With flocculant addition, the internal structure and networking of the pre-aggregates is largely preserved but they are rapidly and effectively bound together by the aggregate-bridging action of the flocculant. The effects of initial pH and Ca ion addition on these structures are also analyzed. Statistical analysis from cryo-SEM imaging shows that there is an inverse correlation of intra-aggregate porosity with Darcian inter-aggregate permeability whereas there is a strong positive correlation of Darcian permeability with settling and primary dewatering rate as a function of pH in suspension. Graphs of partial void contributions also suggest that it is not total porosity that dominates permeability in these systems but the abundance of larger intra-aggregate voids...|$|R

Submarine deep-sea {{tailings}} deposition is {{an alternative}} method of the land-based mine-waste disposal, whereby mineral ore is converted into slurry and transported via a pipeline to processing plants located at the coast. The tailings are then discharged into very deep water offshore where they usually cover {{large parts of the}} sea bottom. This type of deposition is applied only in few countries: Norway, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Chile and Turkey. It is, however, a controversial method of mine tailings disposal primarily due to the hazardous chemicals used during processing and deposited metal sulfides which may dissolve and affects the sea environment. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the copper leaching potential from tailings on the example of the proposed submarine tailings disposal in Repparfjorden discharged from two hydrothermal copper vein type deposits - Nussir and Ulveryggen, exploited by Nussir ASA. The two deposits are 5 km apart and will be processed by the same processing plant. This experiment gives better understanding of the reactivity of sulfide minerals in a saline system during submarine deposition. Planned by Nussir ASA, processing the ore by a flotation system will produce two types of flotation tailings material. These two <b>tailings</b> <b>streams</b> will be mixed with the flotation water, possibly aided by a flocculent, which will be extracted in a thickener afterwards. Seawater will then be added to the material prior to being discharged via a pipeline into the fjord that is at least 90 meters deep. Four kinetic test set-ups containing 0. 5 kg of material and 2 L of seawater were prepared for an experiment that runs for 100 days, by recirculation of the leachate (batch experiments). Seawater was routed through pipes at a constant flow rate of 1 - 2 m/h via a peristaltic pump which arose from about 4 L/h water exchange rate in the column. The columns were run at a temperature of approximately 10 °C. The seawater leachate was saturated by oxygen up to 80 - 100 % in order to maintain condition providing sulfide oxidation leaching. Nine leachate samples were collected from each column for analysis of dissolved constituents and physical parameters. Results show that there was a distinct increase in copper concentration while other hazardous elements did not show significant changes. Copper concentrations reached 0. 025 mg/L after 100 days. Towards the end of experiments (from 70 - 100 days), the leaching rate leveled off with time. Subsequent Cu concentrations indicated that there no more copper was released. Reaction was halted likely because sulfide particles have been consumed or encapsulated by iron hydroxides. The leaching reaction rate observed in this test resulted in a much lower copper contamination than previous estimates (Akvaplan-NIVA, 2011). Following the experiment results the estimated reaction rate is approximately 12. 7 mg/m 2 /year, what involves approximately 5. 75 kg/year of Cu release for proposed 2. 4 km 2 of tailings deposition area or approx. 9. 75 kg/year in 4. 0 km 2 after a year from disposal closure. This is significantly less than the annual copper discharge from a river naturally leaching deposits (500 - 600 kg/year). It was assumed that the copper is being leached only {{from the surface of the}} tailings deposit. This is primarily due the saturated condition of the sediments which prohibits oxygen supply through the deposit. Therefore available oxygen is quickly used up, thereby halting sulfide oxidation (Walder & Rzepka 2013). This research revealed that copper leaching is a two-stage process: (1) initial rapid dissolution of secondary Cu minerals formed from previous sulfide oxidation, related to the tailings material disposing period, and (2) long term slow surface-based leaching of sulfide from tailings material settled on the bottom.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Billions of tons {{of mineral}} wastes are {{generated}} annually by the Australian open-cut coal-mining industry. These wastes include the waste rock which is excavated in order to access the underlying coal seams, and the impurities which are removed when processing the unrefined raw coal. These processing wastes include a gravel-dominated coarse reject stream and a slurry-like <b>tailings</b> reject <b>stream.</b> Typically, the rock waste is disposed of in massive fill structures commonly termed waste dumps or spoil piles, which may be hundreds of meters in height. Coarse rejects from coal processing are trucked to and disposed of in the spoil piles, whilst the fine tailings rejects are traditionally pumped to and disposed of as an aqueous slurry in large tailings dams. These tailings dams are {{a major source of}} safety, environmental and financial risk for mine operators and as such, are subject to increasing financial, social and legislative pressures, coinciding with a decrease in the availability of land on which they can be constructed. An emerging waste disposal strategy in the Australian coal mining industry is spoil-pile codisposal. This entails partly dewatering the tailings rejects, mixing them with the coarse rejects, then disposing of the mixed rejects (herein termed mixed plant rejects or MPR) with the waste rock in the spoil pile. Spoil-pile co-disposal eliminates the requirements to establish and operate a tailings dam and therefore eliminates the associated risks. However, the introduction of potentially low-strength MPR mixtures with relatively high moisture contents poses an increased likelihood of spoil pile slope instability. To date, implementation of spoil-pile co-disposal in the Australian coal mining industry has been largely empirical and based on a “trial and error” approach for waste dump design. Engineering based stability assessments are seldom performed as, at present, the fundamental behaviour or MPR within a spoil pile is not well understood. This is largely attributable to a limited understanding of how various hydrogeological processes facilitate excess pore pressure and varying degrees of saturation during spoil pile construction...|$|R
40|$|The {{demands for}} more {{effective}} utilization of ore bodies and proper risk {{management in the}} mining industry {{have resulted in a}} new cross discipline called geometallurgy. Geometallurgy connects geological, mineral processing and subsequent downstream processing information together to provide a comprehensive model to be used in production planning and management. A geometallurgical program is the industrial application of geometallurgy. It provides a way to map the variation in the ore body, to handling the data and giving metallurgical forecast on spatial level. Three different approaches are used in geometallurgical programs. These include the traditional way, which uses chemical elements, the proxy method, which applies geometallurgical tests, and the mineralogical approach using mineralogy. The mineralogical approach provides the most comprehensive and versatile way to treat geometallurgical data. Therefore it was selected as a basis for this study. For the mineralogical method, quantitative mineralogical information is needed both on deposit and for the process. The geological model must describe the minerals present, give their chemical composition, report their mass proportions (modal composition) in the ore body and describe the texture. The process model must be capable of using mineralogical information provided by the geological model to forecast the metallurgical performance of different geological volumes (samples, ore blocks, geometallurgical domains or blends prepared for the plant) and periods (from minutes via hourly and daily scale to week, monthly and annual production). A literature survey showed that areas, where more development is needed for using the mineralogical approach, are: 1) quick and inexpensive techniques for reliable modal analysis of the ore samples; 2) textural classification of the ore capable to forecast the liberation distribution of the ore when crushed and ground; 3) unit operation models based on particle properties (at mineral liberation level) and 4) a system capable to handle all this information and transfer it to production model. This study focuses on solving the first and the third problem. A number of methods for obtaining mineral grades were evaluated with a focus on geometallurgical applicability, precision and trueness. The method survey included scanning electron microscopy based automated mineralogy, quantitative X-ray powder diffraction with Rietveld refinement, and element-to-mineral conversion. A new technique called combined method uses both quantitative X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement and the element-to-mineral conversion method. The method not only delivers the required turnover for geometallurgy, but also overcomes the shortcomings if X-ray powder diffraction or element-to-mineral conversion when used alone. Furthermore, various methods of obtaining modal mineralogy were compared and a model for evaluating precision and closeness of the methods was developed. Different levels of processing models can be classified in geometallurgy based on in which level the ore, i. e. the feed stream to the processing plant, is defined and what information subsequent streams carry. For mineral processing models the following five levels can be distinguished: particle size only level, elemental level, element by particle size level, mineral level, mineral by particle size level and mineral liberation (particle) level. The most comprehensive level of mineral processing models is the particle-based one which includes all necessary information for modeling unit operations. Within this study, as the first step, a unit operation model is built on particle level for wet low-intensity magnetic separation. The experimental data was gathered through a survey of the KA 3 iron ore concentrator plant of Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) in Kiruna. The first wet magnetic separator of the process was used {{as the basis for the}} model development since the degree of liberation is important at this stage. Corresponding feed, concentrate and <b>tailings</b> <b>streams</b> were mass balanced on a mineral by size and liberation level. The mass balanced data showed that the behavior of individual particles in the magnetic separation is depending on their size and composition. The model, which has a size dependent by-pass parameter and a separation parameter dependent of the magnetic volume of the particle, is capable of forecasting the behavior of particles in magnetic separation. Modeling and simulation show the benefits that particle-based simulation provides compared to lower level process models which take into account only elemental or mineral grades.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{laboratory studies}} of sulphidic mine tailings remediated by flooding, and a pilot-scale study of dry cover for remediation of unoxidised sulphide-rich tailings. At the Kristineberg Zn-Cu mine in northern Sweden, sulphide-rich, poorly buffered tailings have been deposited in five impoundments located along a valley. By increasing pH by liming, thereby reducing metal mobility, a water-covered downstream impoundment {{is made to}} function as a trap for metals released from the till-covered impoundments upstream. As a result of the liming, a calcite-gypsum sludge has been formed on the tailings. The potential metal release from the sludge during resuspension events and in a long-term perspective was investigated by performing a shake flask test and sequential extraction of the sludge. A laboratory mixing experiment was performed to simulate the flocculation processes that occur in limed <b>tailings</b> ponds if <b>stream</b> water is diverted through a pond {{as a part of a}} remediation programme. The laboratory studies showed that the sequentially extracted carbonate and oxide fractions together contained ≥ 97 % of the total amount of Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the sludge. The association of these metals with carbonates and oxides appears to result from sorption and/or co-precipitation reactions at the surfaces of calcite and Fe, Al and Mn oxyhydroxides forming in the impoundment. In the shake flask test, remobilisation of Zn, Cu, Cd and Co (at a pH of 7 - 9) from the sludge resulted in dissolved concentrations of these metals that were significantly lower than those predicted to result from dissolution of the carbonate fraction of the sludge. This may suggest that cationic Zn, Cu, Cd and Co remobilised from dissolving calcite, gypsum and Al oxyhydroxides were readsorbed onto Fe oxyhydroxides remaining stable under oxic conditions. The laboratory mixing experiment showed that the flocculants that settled were rich in C (18 wt%) and acid leachable Fe (14 - 19 wt%). Thus, organic matter and Fe oxyhydroxides appear to form substantial fractions of the flocculants. Trace metal uptake in the flocculants that settled in the mixing bottles resulted in removal of Cd, Co, Cu and Zn from the dissolved phase. Another part this thesis work focuses on the hydrological aspects of dry covers. The water balance in well-defined, pilot-scale systems with various types of dry cover applied on mine tailings at the Kristineberg site has been studied. Experimental studies of water infiltration through dry covers on sulphidic tailings can be used for predicting cover performance and cover design parameters relating to the same climate conditions and the same type of tailings. For this purpose, different multilayer covers have been applied in pilot-scale test cells. Clayey till, sewage sludge, Trisoplast (a mixture of a polymer, bentonite and tailings sand) and fine-grained apatite are used as sealing layers, on top of which a protective cover of unspecified till has been applied. To be able to evaluate the behaviour of the multilayer covers in tailings-impoundment scale, and to predict how the different barrier constructions influence infiltration rate and water balance, the experimental soil covers have been monitored for water percolation, climate conditions and frost penetration. The different infiltration rates in different cells were discussed. The initial results for the first two years of monitoring suggest that the apatite concentrate as a sealing layer is more promising in reducing net infiltration than a 0. 3 m thick clayey till. The high fractions of water percolated through the sealing layers (~ 30 % of precipitation) may be explained by the absence of natural run-off from the experimental cells. The results show that snowmelt, freezing of the soil and differences in soil hydraulic properties appear to have effects on the differences in water balance in the cells.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Radioactivity is {{well known}} and well understood, but its {{usefulness}} in industrial applications to optimise processes or increase economic viability is not yet fully utilised by many industries. This study focuses on the measurement of natural radioactivity and its application in heavy mineral separation and vineyard soil classification. The gamma radiometry set-up consisted of a high purity germanium detector, a Marinelli beaker as sample container and associated electronics. It was calibrated for laboratorybased measurements by minimising the background radiation {{with the use of}} lead castle and energy and resolution calibrations. Furthermore, detection parameters were optimised; these included the counting time, the selection of gamma rays used for analysis of a sample, the peak area calculation for the detector dead time and the detector efficiency. Given that the samples had different densities and volumes, the detector efficiency had to be corrected for volume and density effects. After implementation of the corrections and optimisations the detection system was tested and found able to accurately measure radioactivity concentrations. The systematic measurement errors for 238 U were 5. 1 % {{in the case of the}} heavy mineral sands and 34. 3 % for the vineyard soils, 4. 5 % for the 232 Th concentrations and 4. 7 % for 40 K concentrations. Statistical errors were kept below 2 %. The application of radiometry has not been done before at any South African heavy mineral separation plant. For this reason radiometry is suggested as an easier, faster and cheaper alternative to X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for effective implementation of grade control for zircon to improve the cost benefit of the heavy mineral separation process. Zircon is an example of a heavy mineral that is worldwide in demand with a consumption of more than a million tonnes per year. It is used in a wide range of industrial applications and products that include tiles, sanitary ware and plasma displays. South Africa is the second largest producer of zircon in the world and also has the second largest reserve of available zircon, making this mineral a viable source of income for several years to come. Radioactivity, in the form of uranium and thorium, and other impurities such as iron oxide and titanium oxide are found in the crystal lattice of zircon. For it to be a sellable product, the sum of the uranium and thorium concentrations must be less than 500 parts per million for prime or first grade zircon and less than 1000 parts per million for second grade zircon. At present the concentrations of uranium and thorium in zircon concentrates are measured on a whole rock basis by XRF during and at the end of the processing cycle before the final products are ready to be shipped. This is not an ideal situation as the grab samples are taken periodically and are not necessarily representative of the stream or final assignment and has resulted in significant losses by the producer. The solution is to accurately measure the uranium and thorium concentrations fast or immediately, preferably the measurements must be made online and in real time so that processing decisions can be implemented quickly to optimise the final product. Heavy mineral sand samples were obtained from the various separation processes in a Mineral Separation Plant and their 238 U and 232 Th concentrations determined. The results indicated that the samples’ uranium to thorium ratios together with their total concentrations can be used to differentiate between the samples (i. e. separation processes). The measurement results were compared with those obtained with XRF. The correlations with radiometry were excellent for the uranium (r 2 = 0. 992), thorium (r 2 = 0. 998) and total concentrations (r 2 = 0. 998). Radiometric measurements were also conducted by decreasing the counting time from 3600 s to 1 s to investigate its effect on the accuracy of the results. Correlations between the different times and 3600 s ranged from excellent to good. The obtained results are then used to recommend that radiometry is used in a Mineral Separation Plant to verify that the zircon and zirkwa meet the specifications, to optimise the entrance feed and the other separation processes and to monitor the <b>tailings</b> <b>streams.</b> Finally the practical aspects of the implementation of radiometry are discussed. As a second application was radiometry applied in an agricultural pilot study to demonstrate the applicability of radiometry as a possible useful tool in soil classification. The creation of a vineyard is a long term and expensive investment and its yield and quality will be influenced by many factors such as the type of soil, viticultural preparations and climate. Information on the different soil types in a vineyard is therefore indispensable for the optimisation of land use with respect to vine cultivar, wine quality and production. Soil samples were obtained from Kanonkop, Simonsig and Spier vineyards and their 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K concentrations determined, assuming that fertilisers would have no effect on the results. The difference in 40 K concentrations were related to the clay fraction of the soil and demonstrated that the Kanonkop and Simonsig soils are fine-grained and clay-rich compared to the sandy coarse-grained soils of Spier. The uranium and thorium concentrations were indicators of whether the mineralogy of the soil is the same as the underlying bedrock as well as soil maturity. The measurement results were compared with those obtained with XRF. The correlation with radiometry were poor for the uranium concentrations (r 2 = 0. 314), as many of the samples concentrations were below the XRF detection limit. The correlations were excellent for both thorium (r 2 = 0. 985) and potassium (r 2 = 0. 999). As a positive result from the findings of the study was an in-situ measurement performed by Newman et al. for the radiometric mapping of a Simonsig vineyard for soil classification. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Radioaktiwiteit is wel bekend en word goed verstaan, tog is die gebruik daarvan in industriele toepassings om prosesses te optimiseer of winsgrense te verhoog nog nie deur baie industrië ten volle benut nie. Hierdie studie fokus op die meting van natuurlike radioaktiwiteit en die toepassing daarvan in swaar mineraal skeiding en wingerd grond klassifikasie. Die gamma radiometrie opstelling het bestaan uit ‘n hoë suiwerheid germanium detektor, 'n Marinelli beker as monster houer en verwante elektronika. Dit was gekalibreer vir laboratorium gebaseerde metings deur die vermindering van die agtergrondstraling met die gebruik van lood kasteel en energie en resolusie kalibrasies. Verder was deteksie parameters geoptimaliseer, dit sluit in die teltyd, die keuse van gammastrale wat gebruik word vir die ontleding van 'n monster, die piek area berekening, die korreksie vir die detektor se dooie tyd en die detektor doeltreffendheid. Gegee dat die monsters van mekaar verskil het in terme van dighteid en volume was dit nodig om die detektor doeltreffendheid te korrigeer vir volume en digtheid effekte. Na die implementering van die korreksies en optimalisasie was die detektor stelsel getoets en was gevind dat radioaktiwiteit konsentrasies akkuraat gelewer kan lewer. Die sistematiese meet foute vir 238 U was 5. 1 % vir die mineraal sand en 34. 3 % vir wingerd grond, 4. 5 % vir 232 Th konsentrasies en 4. 7 % vir 40 K konsentrasies. Statistiese foute was onder 2 % gehou. Die toepassing van radiometrie was nog nie voorheen by enige Suid-Afrikaanse swaar mineraal skeidings aanleg gedoen nie. Vir die rede is radiometrie voorgestel as ‘n makliker, vinniger en goedkoper alternatief teenoor XSF vir effektiewe implementering van graad beheer vir zirkon om die koste voordeel van die swaar mineral skeiding proses te verbeter. Zirkon is ‘n voorbeeld van ‘n swaar mineraal wat wêreldwyd in aanvraag is met ‘n verbruik van meer as ‘n miljoen ton per jaar. Dit word in ‘n wye reeks van industriele toepassings en produkte gebruik onder andere teëls, sanitêre ware en plasma skerms. Suid Afrika is die tweede grootste vervaardiger van zirkon in die wêreld en het ook die tweede grootste reserwe van besikbare zirkon. Dit veroorsaak dat die mineraal ‘n lewensvatbare brom van inkomste is vir nog etlike jare. Radioaktiwiteit, in die vorm van uraan en thorium, word tesame met ander onsuiwerhede soos ysteroksied en titaanoksied in zirkon se kristal rooster gevind. Om ‘n verkoopbare produk te wees moet die som van die uraan en thorium konsentrasies minder wees as 500 dele per miljoen vir prima en eerste graad zirkon en minder wees as 1000 dele per miljoen vir tweede graadse zirkon. Huidiglik word die uraan en thorium konsentrasies in die zirkon konsentraat gemeet op ‘n heel gesteente basis met X-straal fluoroskopie (XSF) gedurende en op die einde van die prosesering siklus net voor die finale produk reg is om versend te word. Dit is nie die ideale situasie nie, want die monsters word periodies geneem en is nie noodwendig verteenwoordigend van die stroom of die finale produk nie en het al tot beduidende verliese deur die vervaardiger gelei. Die oplossing is om die uraan en thorium konsentrasies vinnig of onmiddelik te meet, verkieslik moet die metings inlyn en intyds gedoen word om verwerkings besluite vinnig geimplementeer kan word om die finale produk te optimaliseer. Swaar mineraal sand monsters was verkry van die verskeie skeidingsprosesse in ‘n Mineraal Skeidings Aanleg en hul 238 U en 232 Th konsentrasies bepaal. Die resultate het aangetoon dat die monsters se uraan en thorium verhoudings saam met hul totale konsentrasies gebruik kan word om te onderskei tussen die monsters (oftewel die skeiding prosesse). Die meting resultate was vergelyk met dié verkry met XSF. Die korrelasies met radiometrie was uitstekend vir die uraan (r 2 = 0. 992), thorium (r 2 = 0. 998) en totale konsentrasies (r 2 = 0. 998). Radiometriese metings was ook uigevoer deur die teltyd te verminder van 3600 s tot 1 s om die uitwerking daarvan op die akkuraatheid van die resultate te ondersoek. Korrelasies tussen die verskillende tye en 3600 s het gewissel van uitstekend tot goed. Die bevindinge was dan gebruik om aan te beveel dat radiometrie in a Mineraal Skeidings Aanleg gebruik kan word om te verifeer dat daar aan die zirkon en zirkwa spesifikasies voldoen word, om die begin voer en ander skeidings prosesse te optimaliseer en ook die uitskot strome te monitor. Laastens is die praktiese aspekte van die implementering van radiometrie bespreek. Vir die tweede toepassing was radiometrie toepgepas in ‘n loods studie in die landbou om die toepaslikheid van radiometrie as ‘n moontlike nuttige instrument in grond klassifikasie te demonstreer. Die skepping van ‘n wingerd is ‘n lang termyn en duur belegging waarvan die opbrengs en kwaliteit beinvloed sal word deur vele faktore, onder andere die tipe grond, wynbou voorbereidings en die klimaat. Inligiting oor die verskillende grond tipes in ‘n wingerd is daarom onmisbaar vir die optimalisering van land gebruik in betrekking tot die wingerdstok kultivar, wyn kwaliteit en produksie. Radiometrie is toegepas om te demonstreer die toepaslikheid daaran as ‘n moontlike nuttige instrument in grond klassifikasie. Grondmonsters was verkry vanaf Kanonkop, Simonsig en Spier wingerde en hul 238 U, 232 Th en 40 K konsentrasies bepaal met die aanname dat kunsmis nie ‘n uitwerking op die resultate sou hê nie. Die verskil in 40 K konsentrasies was verwant aan die kleifraksie van die grond en het getoon dat die Kanonkop en Simonsig gronde is fyn korrelrig en kleiryk is in vergelyking met die sanderige growwe korrel grond van Spier. Die uraan en thorium konsentrasies het gedui op die samestelling van die grond en ook aangedui watter grond dieselfde is as die onderliggende rots. Die meting resultate was vergelyk met dié verkry met XSF. Die korrelasie met die radiometrie was sleg vir die uraan konsentrasies (r 2 = 0. 314) aangesien baie van die monster konsentrasies laer was as die XSF deteksie limiet. Die korrelasies was uitstekend vir beide thorium (r 2 = 0. 985) en kalium (r 2 = 0. 999). As ‘n positiewe resultaat van die studie se bevindinge was ‘n in-situ meting gedoen deur Newman et al. om ‘n Simonsig wingerd radiomeries te karteer vir grond klassifasie...|$|R
