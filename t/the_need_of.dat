5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E

5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care.

5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} above all by mediaeval Gothic art, {{but wanted to}} improve on its structural solutions.

Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.|$|E

Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land.

5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.|$|E

As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.|$|E

5|$|Symeon is {{recognized}} as the first Byzantine mystic to freely share his own mystical experiences.

Symeon wrote and spoke frequently about the importance of experiencing directly the grace of God, often talking about his own experiences of God as divine light. Another common subject in his writings was <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> putting oneself under the guidance of a spiritual father. The authority for many of his teachings derived from the traditions of the Desert Fathers, early Christian monks and ascetics. Symeon's writings include Hymns of Divine Love, Ethical Discourses, and The Catechetical Discourses.|$|E

30|$|In {{an ideal}} setting, this {{allocation}} would address <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> all users {{in a way}} that maximizes economic welfare. Regrettably, for multiple reasons, this rarely happens. First, there is bias in <b>the</b> prioritization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs.</b> It is a well-known fact that, for understandable political reasons, most decision-makers are very sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> passenger-related traffic; while being much less supportive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> freight and service activity (FSA). This is reflected in the adage “freight doesn’t vote”, frequently used by freight advocates to explain the tendency of decision-makers to disregard <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> freight activity. As a result, addressing <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traffic associated with pick-up and delivery of cargo and the ones related to the provision of services at commercial establishments and households are relegated to lower priorities. A second reason is the profound lack of awareness of the magnitude, scope, and importance of FSA; which leads to a situation where well-meaning decision-makers may not even be aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> FSA, or may honestly perceive that these needs are being met in other ways.|$|R
5|$|The Orkneyinga saga {{reports that}} Malcolm married {{the widow of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Ingibiorg, a {{daughter}} of Finn Arnesson. Although Ingibiorg is generally assumed to have died shortly before 1070, {{it is possible that}} she died much earlier, around 1058. The Orkneyinga Saga records that Malcolm and Ingibiorg had a son, Duncan II (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim), who was later king. Some Medieval commentators, following William of Malmesbury, claimed that Duncan was illegitimate, but this claim is propaganda reflecting <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> Malcolm's descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan's descendants, the Meic Uilleim. Malcolm's son Domnall, whose death is reported in 1085, is not mentioned by the author of the Orkneyinga Saga. He is assumed to have been born to Ingibiorg.|$|E
