5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> at {{this time}} no common {{agreement}} {{on the way to}} present plant names so they ranged in length from one word to lengthy descriptive sentences. As the number of recorded plants increased this naming system became more unwieldy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} focus of Australia's {{military}} during World War I was overseas in Europe and the Middle East, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a necessity to maintain troops in Australia on home service to carry out a number of essential tasks. As the AIF was otherwise engaged these duties out of necessity fell to the soldiers of the militia and a small number of regular soldiers.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{appearance}} of fever is related to certain diseases, in general medical practice <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> no good and reliable parameters to specify the underlying cause of fever. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a lot of insecurity regarding urgency, necessity, duration and form of treatment for many diseases {{because of the lack of}} reliable markers. Biomarkers like Procalcitonin, IL- 6 and IL- 8 show first solutions but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> many unanswered questions...|$|R
5|$|In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray {{to compete}} at their annual Emirates Cup tournament.

5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 55 Cancri c was detected by observing changes in its star's radial velocity. This was achieved by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. At the time of discovery, 55 Cancri A was already known to possess one planet (55 Cancri b); however, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a drift in the radial velocity measurements which was unaccounted for.|$|E
5|$|The Reverend Samuel Marsden {{delivered}} the first sermon on 6 July 1824. In 1836 the first (and only) Bishop of Australia, William Grant Broughton, was installed at St James' as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> no cathedral. Broughton regularly officiated at St James' {{as at the}} first ordination of an Anglican priest in Australia (the Revd T. Sharpe) on 17 December 1836.|$|E

50|$|In most cultures, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{few or no}} matrilineal surnames, or matrinames, so <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> few or no matrilineal surname projects. But {{note that}} DNA tests are equally {{important}} for the two sexes (see genealogical DNA test).|$|R
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> enough mining to {{keep the}} railroads busy, but not for long. In 1897 the Midland went bankrupt. It {{continued}} operating, and a new company formed under the same name to take over. In 1919 Smuggler Mine, the city's largest and oldest, shut down most of its operations and several others closed. The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy; there was no second resurrection. Its tracks and right-of-way, including the bridges, were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|After {{approximately}} three weeks, the expedition arrived in Lambaréné {{and met with}} Albert Schweitzer. Klevan later described the meeting with Schweitzer as the greatest moment of the entire expedition. Later, the hospital received 500kg of Norwegian klippfisk (dried and salted cod), a particular favourite with the hospital's patients. The medicines were handed over, and the container was opened. Even though the drainage had been monitored throughout the expedition, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> great excitement associated with seeing the result firsthand. The block of ice {{turned out to be}} almost entirely intact.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision {{would be made}} after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of}} a story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E

5|$|Although {{mechanisation}} of the British cavalry {{was well}} advanced by 1939, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a 1st Cavalry Division that {{served in the}} Syria–Lebanon Campaign during the Second World War. Eventually all the cavalry regiments were mechanised and {{became part of the}} Household Cavalry and the Royal Armoured Corps. There is still one regiment that retains their horses, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which together with the Household Cavalry Regiment was formed from the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, which was itself an amalgamation of the Royal Horse Guards (Blues) and the 1st (Royal) Dragoons.|$|E
5|$|By December, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> no word of García de Celís, nor had Spanish {{assistance}} {{arrived from}} any other direction, and the Spanish at Buena Esperanza had lost hope. They were pressed on all sides by hostile natives, with resistance led by Sicumba. Cerezeda got word of a plan by Sicumba to assault Buena Esperanza and destroy it. In response he sent parties to seize and execute hostile Indian leaders, thus defusing the imminent threat, although Sicumba managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} extremely difficult, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action. At first {{the representatives of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} declaration, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{substantial}} support for James in Scotland. Viscount Dundee raised an {{army in the}} Scottish Highlands and won a convincing victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July. The huge losses suffered by Dundee's troops, however, coupled with his fatal wounding {{at the start of}} the battle, served to remove the only effective resistance to William and the uprising was quickly crushed, suffering a resounding defeat the next month at the Battle of Dunkeld.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} {{formation}} of the 3rd Division, Barrowclough had been aware that New Zealand's ability to keep it and the 2nd New Zealand Division in the field was limited. However, so long as the Japanese posed a threat to New Zealand's security, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> political will for the 3rd Division to be maintained. With the Japanese no longer a meaningful concern to the country, New Zealand's increasing shortage of manpower resulted in the disbandment of the 3rd Division. As well as providing reinforcements for the 2nd New Zealand Division, at the time engaged in fighting in Italy, it allowed men to return to vital industries in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration {{of the question}} of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{remains of}} the mills and mines at Lowertown.

5|$|In 2002, further {{measurements}} {{revealed the}} presence of a long-period planet in an orbit at around 5 AU from the star. Even when both of the two planets were accounted for, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a periodicity at around 43 days. However, this period is close to the rotation period of 55 Cancri A, which led to the possibility that the 43-day period was caused by stellar rotation rather than a planet. Both the 43-day planet (designated 55 Cancri c) and the 5 AU planet (designated 55 Cancri d) were announced in the same paper, labeled in order of increasing distance from the star.|$|E
5|$|In 597, a Benedictine monk {{had been}} sent by Pope GregoryI to start {{converting}} Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with {{which he or she}} was usually buried upon death.|$|E
5|$|L.A.P.D. {{formed in}} Bakersfield, California, in 1989. The band was started with Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu. With both guitarist and bass guitar {{positions}} filled, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{a need for}} a lead vocalist, as well as a percussionist. The group asked Pete Capra to join their band. Capra joined the band and was positioned as lead vocalist. Although he had not been a vocalist for other bands, Capra introduced the group to bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More. The group was inspired by the bands that Capra had shown them, and committed to head into those band's genres and style.|$|E
