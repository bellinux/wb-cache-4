5|$|Another set of officials, <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. <b>The</b> <b>chain</b> crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – two members of <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> crew will hold {{either of the two}} sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. <b>The</b> <b>chain</b> crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E

Cranor also expanded <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. <b>The</b> <b>chain</b> {{had to contend with}} the rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> by a larger amount while others give the player longer before <b>the</b> <b>Chain</b> Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2000, SFI, {{the owner}} of the Litten Tree bar chain, {{announced}} a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> in order to pursue new challenges. By this time <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> had 32 outlets. According to analysts, <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. <b>The</b> <b>chain</b> has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chain</b> can {{be divided}} into three subsections. The first, the Hawaiian {{archipelago}} (also known as the Windward isles), consists of the islands comprising the U.S. state of Hawaii (not {{to be confused with the}} island of Hawaii). As it is the closest to the hotspot, this volcanically active region is the youngest part of <b>the</b> <b>chain,</b> with ages ranging from 400,000 years to 5.1million years. The island of Hawaii is comprised by five volcanoes, of which two (Kilauea and Mauna Loa) are still active.

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of <b>the</b> <b>chain,</b> falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b> Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> by a larger amount while others give the player longer before <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|E
