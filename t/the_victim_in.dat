Meanwhile; Megan tries to build a better relationship with her colleagues.|$|E

5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} {{eventually}} reopened in 2009. At their location in Virginia, the FBI completed a forensic facial reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> 2010, after her exhumation, {{in hopes that}} someone who knew <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> life could possibly recognize her. Her DNA was also processed by the agency.|$|E

25|$|The weregeld {{was set at}} a {{basic amount}} of 200 shillings, which could be multiplied {{depending}} on the status (descent, caste) of <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> <b>In</b> Anglo-Saxon law, the regular freeman {{is known as a}} two-hynde man ("a man worth 200"), and noblemen are either six-hynde man (threefold weregeld) or twelve-hynde man (sixfold weregeld).|$|E
25|$|It isn't {{long before}} they decide to finally live {{together}} {{in a place of}} their own.

25|$|In {{computer}} network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed denial-of-service attack. In {{this kind of}} attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in IP packets sent to <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> <b>In</b> general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.|$|E

25|$|Altering the backstory of <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> <b>In</b> the novel, Mrs Boynton is a tyrannical sadist {{and former}} prison warden, which {{is central to}} her murder. She remains a sadist in the adaptation, this time in control of a large {{financial}} empire. She could not have any children of her own, so she selected her children from orphanages, {{all of whom were}} badly abused and tormented.|$|E
25|$|Sexual assault is any {{involuntary}} {{sexual act}} {{in which a}} person is threatened, coerced, or forced to engage against their will, or any sexual touching of a person who has not consented. This includes but is not limited to rape (forcible sexual penetration), groping, forced kissing, or the torture of <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> a sexual manner. In legal terms, sexual assault is a statutory offense in the United States, varying widely state-to-state.|$|E
25|$|Contrasts {{between this}} case and the murder of Hannah Williams have been drawn, citing the {{disparity}} in news {{media coverage of the}} two as an example of missing white woman syndrome. Jewkes cites the media coverage of the Jones case {{as an example of the}} news media's eroticisation of <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> such cases, pointing to the news media's reports of the sexual relationship between victim and murderer, and the news media's publication of photographs of the victim's stockings.|$|E

25|$|In the March 2006 {{issue of}} the Personnel Plus, an article revived false blood libel accusations from the infamous 1911 Beilis Trial by mischaracterizing the verdict as the jury {{recognizing}} the case as ritual murder by persons unknown even though it found Beilis himself not guilty, when in fact the defense had entirely rested on demolishing the concept of Jewish ritual murder. A week earlier, MAUP leaders had visited the grave of Andrei Yuschinsky, the Christian boy who had been <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> the case.|$|E
25|$|Bonin {{was cleared}} of the sodomy {{and murder of}} Sean King because he had led police {{to the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> December 1980, with the {{agreement}} that his leading police to King's body could not be used against him in court, and therefore the prosecutors had discussed King's disappearance at the trial, but not the discovery of his body; he was cleared of the charges of mayhem and murder against Lundgren because, according to David López, he had strenuously denied committing this particular killing in the interviews he had granted to him.|$|E
25|$|The first {{emergency}} services call was reported at 11:43:14 by a student, {{though it was}} initially reported that <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> question was bleeding from a bump to his head. The operator alerted two ambulances at 11:44:11. During the alert, gunshots were heard in the background, but the operator either did not hear them or was unable to identify them. The caller then tried to inform the operator that there was someone with a gun, {{but he was in}} a state of panic at the time and the operator couldn't understand the situation. At 11:46, it was finally determined a shooter was involved, and the incident was reclassified as a shooting.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{increase}} in number of hate crimes during the last decade, {{there has been a}} sense of urgency to respond to the problem of hate violence in Turkey. The purpose of the research was to examine relations between homophobic ideologies and the perceptions of liability of perpetrators and victims of hate crime based on sexual orientation. Data were collected from 281 university students by using hate crime vignettes and questionnaires. Consistent with our predictions, participants perceived <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sexually biased hate crime vignettes as more liable than <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> unspecified crime vignette. Participants reported <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> based on sexual orientation would have avoided the danger more than <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> unspecified vignette. Our findings provide additional insight into attitudes and beliefs leading tolerance or hostility toward <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of hate crimes...|$|R

25|$|The star of Perverted Criminal, Setsu Shimizu, {{had first}} come to {{prominence}} for her {{leading role in}} director Shin'ya Yamamoto's Nihon Cinema pink film, Torture by a Woman (1967). Prior to this breakout performance, she had been cast in supporting roles in various pink films for directors such as Giichi Nishihara and Perverted Criminals Kōji Seki. She later starred in Kin'ya Ogawa's 1968 horror film for Ōkura Studio, Ghost Story Of Barabara Phantom. Director Seki's 1969 film Abnormal Sex Crimes was a remake of Perverted Criminal. Mari Nagisa, who {{had a role in}} Perverted Criminal, starred as <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> this remake, and Kōhei Tsuzaki was the rapist.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, {{many changes}} have {{occurred}} in the perception of sexual assault {{due in large part to}} the feminist movement and its public characterization of rape as a crime of power and control rather than purely of sex. In some countries the women's liberation movement of the 1970s created the first rape crisis centers. One of the first two rape crisis centers, the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, opened in 1972. It was created to promote sensitivity and understanding of rape and its effects on <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> <b>In</b> 1960 law enforcement cited false reporting rates at 20%. By 1973 the statistics had dropped to 15%.|$|E
25|$|Women are not {{necessarily}} sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues. Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility. For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women shunned her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit. Women may even project hostility onto <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> order to bond with their male coworkers and build trust.|$|E
