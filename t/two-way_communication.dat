Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for <b>two-way</b> <b>communication.</b> The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Communication Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{rapid changes}} {{in the world of}} online {{technology}} during the last two decades brought along new challenges and opportunities for public relations practitioners. Literature has proven that the interactive capabilities of web-based technology have the possibility to build and maintain relationships with stakeholders and create <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> opportunities. One such technology is an intranet, which could have an immense impact on an organisation's internal communication environment. If managed and applied correctly the intranet has the possibility to build two-way symmetrical relationships with an organisation's internal stakeholders - often described as one of the organisation's most strategic stakeholder groups. In this applied research study, the contribution of an international mining organisation's intranet to internal <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> was explored and described. An extensive literature study was conducted to determine how an intranet could contribute theoretically to <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication.</b> The empirical findings were obtained by means of two main research methods: a qualitative content analysis and semi-structured interviews with middle management employees. The content analysis described how the basic principles of <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> were applied on the Lonmin Platinum intranet. The semistructured interviews with middle management explored and described how they perceived and used the intranet with regard to <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication.</b> It was concluded that the Lonmin intranet did not contribute to <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication.</b> A critical conclusion is that an intranet as a mediated communication medium could not contribute to <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> if the internal communication climate does not facilitate the specific values related to the Excellence Theory and <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> principles. Another conclusion is that Lonmin's intranet was too technologically focussed. There was no management of strategic communication or ownership, and as a result the intranet did not contribute to <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> in the organisation. It is suggested that future studies describe the contribution of the Lonmin intranet to <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> after the communication department had commenced with strategic intranet management. The relation between the contribution of the intranet to <b>two-way</b> symmetrical <b>communication</b> in the organisation and the general communication climate could also be explored in future research studies.

25|$|The CAB {{primarily}} {{attributed the}} crash {{to the failure}} of the Swift's pilot to exercise proper caution during his landing approach. The Swift's pilot radioed the Love tower to request a straight-in approach, but he did so much closer to the airport than recommended by flight regulations, he did not state his position, heading, or speed, and he failed to establish <b>two-way</b> <b>communication</b> to obtain a landing clearance. If a pilot could not establish clear contact with the tower, visual flight rules stated that he should only continue the approach with extreme caution under the assumption that conflicting air traffic was in the area. Instead, he continued the straight-in approach {{as if he had been}} properly cleared to land. Due to the lack of communication with the Swift, controllers were unaware of the proximity of the two aircraft until the Swift was spotted from the tower, leaving inadequate time to warn the airliner's crew of the situation.|$|E

25|$|According to Harry A. Poeze, Malaka {{assumed that}} the colonial {{government}} used the educational system to produce educated indigenous people who would repress their own people. Malaka founded Sekolah Sarekat Islam to rival the government schools. Syaifudin writes that Malaka had four different methods of teaching: dialog, jembatan keledai, critical discussion, and sociodrama. In dialog method, Malaka used <b>two-way</b> <b>communication</b> while teaching. During his time teaching in Deli, he encouraged students to criticize their teacher, or the Dutchman, who was often wrong. In the SI school, he entrusted students who received higher grades to teach students with lower grades. Jembatan keledai was inspired by al-Ghazali; in addition to memorizing knowledge, the students were instructed to understand {{and apply it to}} their daily lives. Syaifudin writes that it is the opposite of bank style concept, and that it is similar to contextual teaching and learning. On critical discussion, Malaka not only verbally gave a problem to the students, but attempted to expose the problem directly, a method is similar to the problem-posing method of Paulo Freire.|$|E
25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} they are simply too far apart for {{meaningful}} <b>two-way</b> <b>communication.</b> If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E

Until the F-22 gains a helmet mounted system it will use the AIM-9X's helmetless high off-boresight (HHOBS) capabilities.

While {{the earliest}} broadcasts for the Satellaview included solo-play games and strictly time-linked SoundLink Magazines that gave a sense of the player's direct temporal connection to the broadcasting center, St.GIGA, Nintendo's goal of simultaneous involvement between and amongst players was thought to be lacking. For this reason Nintendo began sponsoring a series of student networking projects to develop a network game that would let home consumers interact with each other over the satellite broadcasting system. The result of this networking project was the world's first integrated radio-game (or SoundLink Game) - BS Zelda.|$|E
