5|$|It {{was also}} {{important}} for time to be standardized across <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> so that {{the information on the}} map should accurately represent the weather at a given time. A standardized time system was first used to coordinate the British railway network in 1847, with the inauguration of Greenwich Mean Time.|$|E
5|$|Ships may cross {{numerous}} <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> on a voyage, so nautical time, {{introduced in}} the 1920s, is used in international waters. Each such zone is uniformly 15 degrees of longitude wide, the ship's clock going forward one hour per zone when travelling eastwards.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006 he {{attended}} a press conference on HMS Illustrious, which was moored in the River Thames at Greenwich. He announced that the 25th anniversary of the Falklands War would be commemorated across 8,000 miles and four <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> – in London, Pangbourne and the Falkland Islands – from 14 to 17 June 2007.|$|E
50|$|The zone is {{two hours}} {{ahead of the}} Hawaii-Aleutian <b>Time</b> <b>Zone,</b> one hour ahead of the Alaska <b>Time</b> <b>Zone,</b> one hour behind the Mountain <b>Time</b> <b>Zone,</b> two hours behind the Central <b>Time</b> <b>Zone,</b> and three hours behind the Eastern <b>Time</b> <b>Zone.</b>|$|R
50|$|Near milepost 61, {{there is}} a time change from Central <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> (Spencer County) to Eastern <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> (Dubois County). As with all <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> changes on {{highways}} maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation, this change in <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> is not marked with any roadside signage.|$|R

5|$|The European Cup final {{had never}} before been played in Russia, making this match the easternmost final in the tournament's history; however, the Luzhniki Stadium had {{previously}} played host to the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, in which Italian club Parma beat French side Marseille 3–0. Because of the difference in <b>time</b> <b>zones,</b> the match kicked off at 22:45 Moscow Time, making it the first Champions League final to start on one day and finish in the next.|$|E
5|$|To {{appeal to}} the European market, Sega formed a French {{affiliate}} called No Cliché, which developed titles such as Toy Commander. Sega Europe also approached Bizarre Creations to develop the critically successful racing game Metropolis Street Racer, which featured detailed recreations of London, Tokyo, and San Francisco—complete with consistent <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> and fictional radio stations—and 262 individual race tracks.|$|E
5|$|Following late local programming, {{the main}} New Year's Rockin' Eve {{broadcast}} begins at 11:30p.m. ET/PT; this {{segment of the}} broadcast can be tape delayed (either by ABC's west coast feed, or {{at the discretion of}} affiliates in the Central and Mountain <b>Time</b> <b>zones)</b> so the countdown corresponds to local time. After the conclusion of festivities from Times Square, the special historically continued into Part 2, which consisted of further pre-recorded concert segments. Part 2 ran into the early morning hours—as late as 3:00a.m. ET/PT. For the 2016-17 edition, New Year's Rockin' Eve provided its first ever live broadcast of midnight festivities for the Central Time Zone, from New Orleans.|$|E

50|$|The Yukon <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> was {{a former}} <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> that kept {{standard}} time; Yukon Standard Time (YST) was obtained by subtracting nine hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) resulting in UTC−9. Yukon Daylight Time (YDT) when observed was eight hours behind UTC. In 1983 the UTC−9-based <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> was restructured and renamed the Alaska <b>Time</b> <b>Zone.</b>|$|R

5|$|Four <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> are {{utilized}} in the basin: Central for storms east of 106°W, Mountain between 114.9°W and 106°W, Pacific between 140°W and 115°W, and Hawaii–Aleutian for storms between the International Date Line and 140°W. However, for convenience, all information is listed by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{first with the}} respective local time included in parentheses. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as the subtropical phase of Omeka, is included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.|$|E
5|$|In the USA, The Smithsonian Institution {{developed}} {{its network}} of observers {{over much of}} the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not all the data on the map was used {{due to a lack of}} time standardization. The United States fully adopted <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{planned to}} rapidly seize European colonies in Asia {{to create a}} large {{defensive}} perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American {{military presence in the}} Philippines from the outset. On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian <b>time</b> <b>zones),</b> Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific. These included an attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya and the battle of Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>zone</b> {{boundaries}} {{have changed}} greatly since their original introduction and changes still occasionally occur. DOT issues press releases when {{these changes are}} made. Generally, <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> boundaries have tended to shift westward. Places on {{the eastern edge of}} a <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> can effectively move sunset an hour later (by the clock) by shifting to the <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> immediately to their east.|$|R
2500|$|Srednekolymsk <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> (SRET, UTC+11). Covers {{most of the}} republic's {{territory}} located east of 140°E longitude. Districts: Abyysky, Allaikhovsky, Momsky, Nizhnekolymsky, Srednekolymsky, Verkhnekolymsky.

5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves <b>time</b> <b>zones,</b> they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern <b>time</b> <b>zones.</b> East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E
5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve was {{temporarily}} placed on hiatus for New Year's Eve 1999–2000. Instead, Clark participated in ABC News's day-long telecast, ABC 2000 Today, which {{as part of}} an international broadcast consortium, televised festivities from around the world celebrating the arrival of the year 2000. Clark joined host Peter Jennings and ABC News reporter Jack Ford as correspondents for the festivities from Times Square. Clark took on a similar role on ABC 2000 Today as he did on New Year's Rockin' Eve, including conducting his traditional countdown alongside Ford at midnight on the East Coast. However, unlike New Year's Rockin' Eve, festivities from Times Square were also broadcast live across the entire country instead of tape-delayed for the West Coast, since the special broadcast midnight festivities in other cities and <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> {{for the remainder of the}} night, as they had done throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of Daylight Saving Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern Daylight Saving Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different <b>time</b> <b>zones,</b> but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves <b>time</b> <b>zones,</b> they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} issuing a {{convective}} watch {{begins with a}} conference call from SPC to local NWS offices. If after collaboration a watch is deemed necessary, the Storm Prediction Center will issue a watch approximation product which {{is followed by the}} local NWS office issuing a specific county-based watch product. The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local <b>time</b> <b>zone(s)</b> of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message informing the public of the meaning behind the watch and to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.|$|E
5|$|The University of Bombay was {{the first}} modern {{institution}} of higher education to be established in India in 1857. The Commercial Bank, the Chartered Mercantile, the Agra and United Service, the Chartered and the Central Bank of Western India were established in Bombay attracting a considerable industrial population. The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 increased the demand for cotton in the West, and led to an enormous increase in cotton-trade. The Victoria Gardens was {{opened to the public}} in 1862. The Bombay Shipping and Iron Shipping Companies were started in 1863 to make Bombay merchants independent of the English. The Bombay Coast and River Steam Navigation Company was established in 1866 for the maintenance of steam ferries between Bombay and the nearby islands; while the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 revolutionized the marine trade of Bombay. The Bombay Municipal Corporation was established in 1872, providing a modern framework of governance for the rapidly growing city. The Bombay Port Trust was promulgated in 1870 for the development and administration of the port. Tramway communication was instituted in 1873. The Bombay Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), originally set up as a tramway company: Bombay Tramway Company Limited, was established in 1873. Violent Parsi-Muslim riots again broke out in February 1874, which were caused by an article on Prophet Muhammad published by a Parsi resident. The Bombay Gymkhana was formed in 1875. The Bombay Stock Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in Asia, was established in 1875. Electricity arrived in Bombay in 1882 and Crawford Market {{was the first}} establishment to be lit up by electricity. The Bombay Natural History Society was founded in 1883. Bombay Time, one of the two official <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> in British India, was established in 1884 during the International Meridian Conference held at Washington, D.C in the United States. Bombay time was set at 4 hours and 51 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) using the 75th east meridian. The Princess Dock was built in 1885 as part of a scheme for improving the whole foreshore of the Bombay harbour. The first institute in Asia to provide Veterinary Education, the Bombay Veterinary College, was established in Parel in Bombay in the year 1886.|$|E
