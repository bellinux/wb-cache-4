5|$|In the morning, Marge {{gets the}} family {{together}} to discuss romance, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> come up with vignettes from their failed relationships {{in the form of}} clips from previous episodes. Homer, however, saves the day when he brings up how he and Marge got together. Ultimately, the kids do not care for this one and wind up watching Itchy & Scratchy while Homer and Marge share a moment together.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E

5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects recede from the Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|At Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance toward Spider-Man, whom {{he deems}} {{responsible}} for his father's death, and asserts that Peter is all the family he has left. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she {{is in love with}} him. Peter, however, feels that he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies. He hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be friends. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|The Town Center {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} buildings in the game. Here villagers are created, and age advancement is researched. Most scenarios have each player begin with a single Town Center; the ability to build multiple Town Centers is unlocked by the construction of the Government Center during the Bronze Age. The Town Center provides population support for four units. In order to build more units, houses must be constructed. Each house supports four units, and although any number of houses can be built (a concept which was not maintained in later games like Age of Mythology), <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> support a maximum of fifty units.|$|E

5|$|The more neutron-rich {{darmstadtium}} isotopes are {{the most}} stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies; however, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements, and indirect synthesis methods are not favourable for chemical studies. The more neutron-rich isotopes 276Ds and 277Ds might be produced directly in the reaction between thorium-232 and calcium-48, but the yield {{is expected to be}} low. Furthermore, this reaction has already been tested without success, and more recent experiments that have successfully synthesized 277Ds using indirect methods show that it has a short half-life of 5.7ms, not long enough to perform chemical studies.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of plant virus, but often they only cause a loss of yield, {{and it is not}} {{economically}} viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms (vectors). These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms and single-celled organisms {{have been shown to be}} vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds. Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> reproduce in living plant cells.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E

5|$|After {{the female}} lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the egg to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.|$|E
5|$|Musical notes {{return in}} Banjo-Tooie, but are now used {{to learn new}} moves from Bottles' brother, the drill {{sergeant}} Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role from the first game. All of Banjo and Kazooie's moves from the first game are immediately accessible in Banjo-Tooie, and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, {{and the ability to}} play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} retired US SEALs needs {{to prevent a}} nuclear attack against United States, planned by an ex-SEAL. Thereunto, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use <b>only</b> blade weapons since the villain's hideout is covered by leaked natural gas.|$|R

30|$|Geometric {{stiffness}} {{methods are}} material independent, {{with only a}} geometric stiffness. However, these methods are applied in their linear form and produce results that are not constructionally practicable (Barnes 1977); thus, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> serve <b>only</b> as a preliminary result.|$|R
5|$|The fourth {{chapter on}} the {{distribution}} and growth of coral reefs examines {{the conditions in which}} they flourish, their rate of growth and the depths at which the reef building polyps can live, showing that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> flourish at a very limited depth. In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for the findings of the previous chapters, overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level, by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides, and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated. This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E
5|$|A portal {{is created}} at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After {{bypassing}} Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E
50|$|Anaerobic {{respiration}} is used {{mainly by}} bacteria and archaea {{that live in}} environments devoid of oxygen. Many anaerobic organisms are obligate anaerobes meaning that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> respire <b>only</b> using anaerobic compounds and will die {{in the presence of}} oxygen.|$|R

5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
5|$|On their journey, they {{encounter}} Phineas, the blind human who helped Jason, {{leader of the}} Argonauts on his journey, and befriend a harpy named Ella that supposedly torments him. They also see the three Cyclopes that Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez encountered in The Lost Hero. During the trip, the trio learns that the goddess Gaea is awakening from several millennia of slumber {{with a plan to}} destroy the gods and the world along with them. Her seven Giant children are being woken, each of whom is matched to fight a their counterpart god. Each Giant has the skills to oppose one god and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be defeated if the gods and the demigods join forces. This proves to be difficult. Percy and his friends manage to defeat the Alaskan Giant and save Camp Jupiter from destruction. During their journey, Hazel and Frank become true heroes who know how to use their powers and have self-confidence. Percy regains his memory on their return to Camp Jupiter and finds an army of monsters (including Stheno, Euryale, and the three Cyclopes) led by Polybotes attacking it. Percy successfully defeats him with the help of Terminus, his Cyclops half-brother, Tyson and the hellhound, Mrs. O'Leary. At the end of the book, the Greek airship, Argo II arrives setting up the plot for The Mark of Athena.|$|E
5|$|Once the Imps are working, {{the player}} must then {{set up a}} basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food, are bred), and a Treasury. After {{connecting}} the dungeon to a 'Portal', minions will arrive. Minions include dragons, warlocks, and the horned reaper, as well as undead creatures such as vampires and skeletons. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms and spells. Rooms can only be built on tiles belonging to the player. The player is red and the tiles are coloured accordingly. Other keepers have different colours, and the heroes are white. Unaligned creatures and rooms are multicoloured. The player can build traps and doors, created in the workshop. Traps include lightning and boulder traps, the latter instantly killing creatures it comes into contact with. As with rooms, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be built on tiles that belong to the player. Traps are not built instantly; Imps need to place them on the blueprint. The Temple is a room where creatures are made happy, and the player can sacrifice creatures to the dark gods. The gods may reward or punish the player, or be indifferent depending on the sacrifice.|$|E
