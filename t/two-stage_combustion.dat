One {{of the most popular}} technological processes is through direct combustion of biomass or in a controlled atmosphere or gasification. The current gasifier that has a maximum heat capacity of combustion system of 15. 02 kW, used to burn biomass (oil palm shell) produces gases of low calorific gas through a low calorific swirl gas burner. Some problem appears using low calorific, it causes no circulation and weak swirling flame, and this will be an increase of residence time at high temperature. The gas burner, which is incorporated with the <b>two-stage</b> biomass <b>combustion</b> system, consists of burner tube and swirl-vane. These swirl gas burners that consist of different turning vane positions i. e. 20 o, 30 o and 40 o, are equal to the swirl number of 0. 22, 0. 356 and 0. 508, respectively.

40|$|International audienceAchieving {{sufficiently}} high {{combustion efficiency}} {{and stability in}} supersonic combustion is extremely challenging and highly dependent on the fuel-injection and mixing strategies adopted. A viable approach to this is the strut injector, which by inducing flow recirculation, facilitates flame stabilization in the strutwake. In this investigation we examine in detail the flow, mixing, self-ignition and flame stabilization mechanisms of conventional and alternating-wedge injection struts. In order to analyze these, we consider NAL’s supersonic combustor, equipped with two conventional two-stage injection struts, and an alternating-wedge injection strut, in conjunction with ONERA’s vitiation air heater. Experimental results, including spontaneous flame images, wall-pressure and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) images of hydroxyl (OH) are here combined with computational results based on finite-rate chemistry Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with skeletal hydrogen-air reaction mechanisms. The spontaneous flame images and the predicted flame structures for both injector-strut types agree well qualitatively, demonstrating that combustion LES captures the overall features of the experiments. Detailed comparisons between experimental data and computational results for the wall pressure and for mean and rms OH-PLIF cross-sections show acceptable agreement, indicating that the LES results {{can be used to}} further study the intrinsic features of the flame structure and the stabilization mechanism. These results indicate significant differences in flow and flame structures between both two-stage injection struts and the alternating-wedge injection strut tested. More specifically, the longitudinal vorticity introduced by the alternating-wedge injection strut increases the combustion efficiency but results in an intermittent auto-ignition phenomenon. For the <b>two-stage</b> injection struts <b>combustion</b> consists of auto-ignition pockets surrounded by self-igniting fronts embedded in a background of non-premixed flames or stirred reactors.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} in small district heating systems is the large load variation that must be handled by the system. If the boiler is designed to cover the needs during the coldest day in winter time in northern Europe it would have to run at loads as low as 10 % of full load during summer time, when heat is needed only for tap water production. Load variations in small networks are quite fast and earlier investigations have shown that existing biomass boilers give rise to large amounts of harmful emissions at fast load variations and at low loads. The problem has been addressed in different ways: Three new boiler concepts have been realized and tested: A prototype of a 500 kW boiler with partitioned primary combustion chamber and supplied with a water heat store. A 10 kW bench scale combustor and a 500 kW prototype boiler based on pulsating combustion. Bench scale boilers to test the influence from applied sound on emissions and a 150 kW prototype boiler with a <b>two-stage</b> secondary vortex <b>combustion</b> chamber. Development of control and regulating equipment: Glow Guard, a control system using infra-red sensors to detect glowing char on the grate, has been constructed and tested. A fast prediction model {{that can be used in}} control systems has been developed. Simulation of the combustion process: Code to simulate pyrolysis/gasification of fuel on the grate has been developed. Combustion of the gas phase inside the combustion chamber has been simulated. The two models have been combined to describe the combustion process inside the primary chamber of a prototype boiler. A fast simulation code based on statistical methods that can predict the environmental performance of boilers has been developed. One of the boiler concepts matches the desired load span from 10 to 100 % of full load with emissions far below the set limits for CO and THC and close to the set limits for NO{sub x}. The other boilers had a bit more narrow load range, one with very low emissions except for NO{sub x} and the other with emissions close to the set limits. The Glow Guard worked as desired and will be a useful tool for control of combustion on the grate. The simulation of the processes inside the combustion chamber matches the experimental results well in terms of velocity and temperature. Species concentration were reasonable well described at the exit from the combustion chamber but were poorly described above the fuel bed.

40|$|Increasing world {{energy demand}} and recent climate change {{due to global}} warming have led us to search for {{sustainable}} energy sources with the lowest possible greenhouse-gas emissions. Our main energy, which sources from fossil fuel, is not sustainable and its combustion produces high content of harmful emissions. Hydrogen is always thought to be an ideal fuel because it is clean, renewable, and has abundant energy sources. Apparently, before hydrogen can be realized as the main energy source, a few major problems, such as the realtime production, safe and convenient storage, efficient combustion of hydrogen gas, and high production cost, need to be addressed. While waiting for the hydrogen technology to mature, the use {{of other types of}} gaseous fuel to combat the greenhouse-gas emissions deem necessary. Natural gas is not a renewable fuel but it has abundant resources and the lowest average specific CO 2 emission among the non-renewable fossil fuel energy resources. Gas engines are typically utilized for electric power generation but are becoming popular in transportation sector. Recent statistical data obtained from NGV Global shows the worldwide growth of NGVs is increasing exponentially. A CNG engine is usually operated in the lean mode where equivalence ratio is between 0. 7 and 1. 0 by employing premixed-type ignition technique. The CNG lean-burn approach has the advantage of high thermal efficiency, low NOX emission, and lower fuel consumption compared to stoichiometric combustion. However, CNG lean combustion has problems such as poor ignitability and poor flame propagation which cause high cyclic variation, misfires and high THC emission. Using the lean-burn approach, the ignitability of the first flame core relies on local fuel-air mixture concentration near the ignition position. Too rich or too lean local mixture will cause the first flame core to quench before it begins to propagate {{to other parts of the}} combustion chamber. It causes poor combustion quality, misfires and higher cycle-to-cycle variations. In this study, a gas-jet direct-ignition method was applied to improve lean CNG engines operation. The gas-jet ignition method employs late injection timing technique which is very near to the ignition timing. The injected fuel reaches the ignition point with low jet velocity to ensure ignitability, while at the same time creating enough combustible mixture to support v flame core development. Through experiments, it was found that the gas-jet ignition method was able to operate in ultra lean mode at equivalence ratio less than 0. 3. To enable engine operation at equivalence ratio between 0. 3 and 0. 8, gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection method has to be implemented. The second gas injection followed by ignition similar to the gas-jet ignition, ensures ignitability. The first injection is delivered early similar to the premixed-type ignition method to create non-heterogeneous mixture to sustain flame development from the kernel initiated by the gas-jet ignition. In the application of gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection using a real engine, the ignitability, combustibility and THC formation were investigated by varying the first injection fuel delivery timing. Moreover, the effect of hydrogen addition to CNG fuel on the ignitability, combustibility and THC formation were also investigated. The fuel-air mixture distribution inside the combustion chamber prior to ignition timing was calculated using CFD software to provide hints on the combustion cyclic variability and THC formation found during the engine tests. Furthermore, flame of the gas-jet ignition with <b>two-stage</b> injection <b>combustion</b> was observed using a constant volume chamber. It was found that the gas-jet ignition and gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection methods are effective to extend lean combustible ranges of CNG engines. The first injection timing in the two-stage injection method is a key factor to the better engine performance because it affects flame development after ignition. The combustion cyclic variation and THC emission are sensitive to mixture distribution in clearance space of the combustion chamber around spark position just after ignition. Such mixture distribution is highly dependent on the first fuel delivery. At lean equivalence ratio, early injection produces well-dispersed bulk mixture leaner than CNG lean combustible limit, thus slows flame development. Late injection tends to produce rich mixture in the clearance space preventing initial flame development. Both cause relatively high THC emission. When hydrogen was added to CNG, it was found to effectively improve flame propagation, resulting in low THC emission free from cyclic variation. Hydrogen flame also supports CNG combustion with lean mixture...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of 27 series of tests, it was {{concluded}} that the maximum reduction of NOx emissions occurred when the sulphur retention was also at its highest, so emphasising the important role that CaSO 4 plays as a catalyst in pollution-reducing reactions. Although the minimal emissions of both SO 2 and NOx (at 85 and 45 ppm, respectively) presently recorded occurred at a bed temperature of 800 Â°C, under <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> and a low oxygen-in-the-flue concentration (= 2 %), the combustion efficiency under these conditions was relatively low (at 72 Â· 9 % without limestone and 84 Â· 5 % with limestone added to the fluidised bed). Optimal conditions for achieving maximum combustion efficiency and minimum pollutant emission occurred at the highest bed-temperature (= 1000 Â°C) employed, under <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> conditions for a moderately high (~ 4 %) oxygen-in-the-flue concentration. Under these conditions, the CaS, formed from the lime in the substoichiometric bed, was completely oxidised to CaSO 4 by the moderately high O 2 concentrations in the freeboard, so optimising the reductions of both the NOx and SO 2 emissions. The addition of limestone was found to increase the combustion efficiency by just under 3 %, to a maximum of 91 Â· 3 %, under these conditions. Further, the presence of limestone (which gave an added Ca:S mole ratio of 2), resulted in reductions in the NOx emissions of 83 % (i. e. from 283 to 47 ppm) and in the SO 2 emission of 74 % (i. e. from 455 to 117 ppm). Both the NOx and SO 2 emissions were greatly reduced by this addition of limestone, under most operating conditions. The magnitude of the reduction varied according to the bed's temperature, e. g. at a bed temperature of 800 Â°C, under two-stage conditions, the NOx emissions were reduced by 71 % and teh SO 2 emission by 76 %, provided sufficient limestone was added to the bed to give a 2 : 1 Ca:S ratio. Similarly, the use of recycled gas, to achieve bed attemperation during these tests, led not only to a reduction in the NOx emissions of 33 %, compared with only 15 % achieved in previous experiments, but also to a 26 % reduction in the SO 2 emission. The latter was {{a direct result of the}} increased residence time for SO 2 gas in the contact with the limestone/ash particles within the combustor. When burning S. A. Duff with: (i) the exhaust-gas recycled back to the bed; (ii) limestone added to the bed (to give a Ca:S mole ratio of 2); and (iii) the fluidised bed operated at a relatively high bed-temperature (~ 1000 Â°C) under <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> conditions with a 4 % concentration of O 2 -in-the-flue; then a 90 % overall reduction in NOx emissions (compared with those occurring under oxidising conditions with no limestone added) and a sulphur retention of 74 % were achieved. Larger sulphur retentions ensued by reducing the bed temperature to 800 Â°C and using lower oxygen-in-the-flue concentrations (~ 2 %), but this occurred to the detriment of the combustion efficiency. Nevertheless, the lower bed-temperature of ~ 800 Â°C was needed to avoid the formation of clinker when burning a low-ash fusion coal, such as Maryport smalls. By contrast, the use of a high bed-temperature (~ 1000 Â°C) with low values of the oxygen-in-the-flue concentration, resulted in no sulphur retention; all the CaS being partially oxidised to SO 2 under these operating conditions, with or without limestone present. ...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{recovery}} from solid wastes is, {{to a large}} extent, limited by over-large fractions of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and other organic chlorine compounds, which can cause problems {{in the operation of}} an incinerator, combustor or gasifier. However, PVC behaves differently from most other plastic materials. At temperatures in the range 200 - 400  °C, PVC decomposes into HCl (hydrogen chloride) and a cokes/char-like residue. This residue can then be burned at higher temperatures as any other chlorine-free solid waste-derived fuel. In this work, a laboratory-scale test facility for <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> of high-PVC solid waste was built and put into operation at Helsinki University of Technology. The facility (40  kW fuel input) contains two fluidized beds: a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB), operating with nitrogen at ∼ 350  °C, and a circulating fluidized bed combustor (CFBC), operating at 800 - 850  °C. Most of the chlorine can be removed (recovered) as HCl from the BFB, which leaves a small percentage to be removed from the flue gases after the CFB. At the same time, this reduces the HCl corrosion problems, with a low risk of formation of chlorinated species such as dioxin and furans. The design work was based on process optimization calculations for a 40  MWthermal plant design case using a process simulation program (PROSIM). The design case was scaled down from 40  MW to 40  kW thermal fuel input. A new module for the pyrolysis reactor was built {{to be used in the}} simulation of the <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> process. The simulation work showed a process thermal efficiency of approx. 36  % compared to 33  %, depending on pyrolysis temperature and the PVC content in the solid waste, for a conventional waste incineration plant. The design of the test facility was also based on kinetic data on the de-hydrochlorination of typical PVC, on combustion of chars from PVC and wood, and on information from the literature. Two types of PVC (bottle-grade PVC and sewage pipe PVC) were used as a fuel in a <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> test facility. The results from both tests were very promising. The chlorine content in the chars taken from the BFB for the bottle-grade PVC was below 0. 1  %-wt (from 50. 93  %-wt in the PVC), at chlorine-to-carbon mass ratio <  0. 001 kg Cl / kg C. This means that a char (which is forwarded to the CFBC) in Class I (less than 0. 15  %-wt Cl) of the Finnish classification of solid recovered fuel (SRF) can be produced using this process. The char chlorine content for the sewage pipe PVC was about 5  %-wt (from 53. 54  %-wt in the PVC) at chlorine-to-carbon mass ratio <  0. 06 kg Cl / kg C. Also, the char sample analysis of sewage pipe PVC  2 for the determination of polychlorinated toxic compounds showed very small amounts of PCDD (0. 78  ng/g, 0. 155  ng TEQ/g) and PCDF (2. 51  ng/g, 0. 35  ng TEQ/g). The result shows that the process has the potential to remove most of the chlorine from a fuel input that contains large amounts of PVC chlorine, i. e., amounts that are problematic for other thermal processes. This despite the use of a cheap perforated distributor plate in both reactors (BFB and CFBC), which may have affected the bed material mixing (especially in the BFB) and the quality of the char that was forwarded to the CFBC. The results also show that the total amount of chlorine released with the CFBC flue gases as HCl was less than 6. 5  % of the Cl input with the PVC. The test results show new information about the behavior of different types of PVC in a <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> process. They confirm that the optimal temperature range for operating the BFB during pyrolysis, 340 - 350  °C, is the optimum temperature range in which to release most of the chlorine from the PVC. It also shows the stabilizer effects of different PVC types on degradation during pyrolysis in the BFB reactor, which affects the quality of the char forwarded to the CFBC. Many tests to examine the PVC behavior when mixed and pyrolyzed or co-pyrolyzed with other fuels like wood (Finnish pine) and Polish coal were performed in this work. The results show that there is an interaction in PVC / wood pine mixtures that affects the degradation of both fuels. A similar interaction also occurs with the PVC / Polish coal mixture. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a novel approach to the solution of detailed chemistry in internal combustion engine simulations, which relies on the analytical computation of the ordinary differential equations (ODE) system Jacobian matrix in sparse form. Arbitrary reaction behaviors in either Arrhenius, third-body or fall-off formulations can be considered, and thermodynamic gasphase mixture properties are evaluated according to the wellestablished 7 -coefficient JANAF polynomial form. The current work presents a full validation of the new chemistry solver when coupled to the KIVA- 4 code, through modeling of a single cylinder Caterpillar 3401 heavy-duty engine, running in <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> mode. The code has been tested {{on a wide range of}} simulations, at different injection timings, intake pressures, and EGR mass fractions, and considering two reaction mechanisms: a skeletal one with 29 species and 52 reactions, and a comprehensive, semi-detailed one with 160 species and 1540 reactions. The results show that the developed approach allows computational time savings of more than one order of magnitude in comparison to a reference chemistry solver, even with no reduction of the combustion mechanism size...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> {{of biomass}} was experimentally/numerically {{investigated}} in a multifuel reactor. The following emissions {{issues have been}} {{the main focus of}} the work: 1 - NO x and N 2 O 2 - Unburnt species (CO and C x H y) 3 - Corrosion related emissions The study had a focus on <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> in order to reduce pollutant emissions (primarily NO x emissions). It is well known that pollutant emissions are very dependent on the process conditions such as temperature, reactant concentrations and residence times. On the other hand, emissions are also dependent on the fuel properties (moisture content, volatiles, alkali content, etc.). A detailed study of the important parameters with suitable biomass fuels in order to optimize the various process conditions was performed. Different experimental studies were carried out on biomass fuels in order to study the effect of fuel properties and combustion parameters on pollutant emissions. Process conditions typical for biomass combustion processes were studied. Advanced experimental equipment was used in these studies. The experiments showed the effects of staged air combustion, compared to non-staged combustion, on the emission levels clearly. A NO x reduction of up to 85 % was reached with staged air combustion using demolition wood as fuel. An optimum primary excess air ratio of 0. 8 − 0. 95 was found as a minimizing parameter for the NO x emissions for staged air combustion. Air staging had, however, a negative effect on N 2 O emissions. Even though the trends showed a very small reduction in the NO x level as temperature increased for non-staged combustion, the effect of temperature was not significant for NO x and C x H y, neither in staged air combustion or non-staged combustion, while it had a great influence on the N 2 O and CO emissions, with decreasing levels with increasing temperature. Furthermore, flue gas recirculation (FGR) was used in combination with staged combustion to obtain an enhanced NO x reduction. The fate of the main corrosive compounds, in particular chlorine, was determined in an experimental campaign using fuel mixtures. The corrosion risk associated with three fuel mixtures was quite different. Grot (Norwegian term used for tree’s tops and branches) was found to be a poor corrosion-reduction additive and could not serve as an alternative fuel for co-firing with straw. Peat was found to reduce the corrosive compounds only at high peat additions (50 wt%). Sewage sludge was the best alternative for corrosion reduction as 10 wt% addition almost eliminated chlorine from the fly ash. Numerical studies were also performed to estimate the emission level in the flue gas using a comprehensive mechanism in a configuration which simulated <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> of biomass. Furthermore, a reduction of the comprehensive chemical mechanism was performed since the mechanism is still complex and needs very long computational time and powerful hardware resources. The selected detailed mechanism in this study contains 81 species and 703 elementary reactions. Necessity analysis was used to determine which species and reactions that are of less importance for the predictability of the final result and, hence, can be discarded. For validation, numerical results using the derived reduced mechanism were compared with the results obtained with the original detailed mechanism. The reduced mechanism contains 35 species and 198 reactions, corresponding to 72 % {{reduction in the number of}} reactions and, therefore, improving the computational time considerably. Yet the model based on the reduced mechanism predicts correctly concentrations of NO x and CO that are essentially identical to those of the complete mechanism in the range of reaction conditions of interest. The modeling conditions are selected in a way to mimic values in the different ranges of temperature, excess air ratio and residence time, since these variables are the main affecting parameters on NO x emission.

40|$|An {{experimental}} parametric {{study of}} rich-lean <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> in a flame tube is described and approaches for minimizing {{the conversion of}} fuel-bound nitrogen to nitrogen oxides in a premixed, homogeneous combustion system are evaluated. Air at 672 K and 0. 48 MPa was premixed with fuel blends of propane, toluene, and pyridine at primary equivalence ratios ranging from 0. 5 to 2. 0 and secondary equivalence ratios of 0. 5 to 0. 7. Distillates of SRC-II, a coal syncrude, were also tested. The blended fuels were proportioned to vary fuel hydrogen composition from 9. 0 to 18. 3 weight percent and fuel nitrogen composition from zero to 1. 5 weight percent. Rich-lean combustion proved effective in reducing fuel nitrogen to NO sub x conversion; conversion rates up to 10 times lower than those normally produced by single-stage combustion were achieved. The optimum primary equivalence ratio, where the least NO sub x was produced and combustion efficiency was acceptable, shifted between 1. 4 and 1. 7 with changes in fuel nitrogen content and fuel hydrogen content. Increasing levels of fuel nitrogen content lowered the conversion rate, {{but not enough to}} avoid higher NO sub x emissions as fuel nitrogen increased...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied a}} stable pilot flame {{system for a}} cannon type {{combustor}} of turbo-engines by adding both a frontchamber and a pilot flame chamber with an electric ignition system to the conventional two-stage system with <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> domains: a primary zone and a secondary zone. The electric ignition period was about 1 second with 2760 V(theoretical) generated by Kochcroft-Welton circuit, and the fuel was butane gas. The inlet was 25 m/sec and the pressure was about 400 Pascal at the inlet of combustor. We set two cases for the outlet configuration: a converging nozzle and a turbine. The outlet temperature was 280 C at the outlet velocity of 25 m/sec, and the temperature was 230 C at the outlet velocity of 12 m/sec. A sufficiently large rotational speed and torque was obtained to rotate the compressor and fan of the turbine. Weanalyzed the ignition mechanism by solving two dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations {{and found that the}} role of the front chamberwas to maintain the pilot flame after the ignition shock. We confirmed experimentally that this system can ignite and preserve a stable pilot flame with quite high probability...|$|E
40|$|Fuel-rich {{catalytic}} combustion (E. R. greater than 5. 0) {{is a unique}} technique for preheating a hydrocarbon fuel to temperatures much higher than those obtained by conventional heat exchangers. In addition to producing very reactive molecules, the process upgrades {{the structure of the}} fuel by the formation of hydrogen and smaller hydrocarbons and produces a cleaner burning fuel by removing some of the fuel carbon from the soot formation chain. With fuel-rich {{catalytic combustion}} as the first stage of a two stage combustion system, enhanced fuel properties can be utilized by both high speed engines, where time for ignition and complete combustion is limited, and engines where emission of thermal NO sub x is critical. <b>Two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> (rich-lean) {{has been shown to be}} effective for NO sub x reduction in stationary burners where residence times are long enough to burn-up the soot formed in the first stage.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about a problem of {{effective}} and environmental friendly pulverized coals incineration. Coal {{is one of the}} main energy resources of the 21 st century. Today all over the world fraction of coal in the fuel balance of thermal power plants increases. For example, in the USA the fraction of coal-fired thermal power plants in electrical power producing is more than 57 % [1], and in Kazakhstan it is about 85 %. Moreover, the rank of power coals is decreasing everywhere. It leads to the difficulties of its ignition and incineration and simultaneous environmental pollution increase. In order to improve the efficiency of coal combustion new plasma-fuel system for thermal power plants is developed. It is pulverised coal burner equipped with arc plasmatron. It provides fuel oil-free start up of pulverised coal fired boilers, flame stabilization, and as a consequence, the simultaneous decrease of unburned carbon and nitrogen oxides formation due to <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> [2]. Plasma-fuel systems procedure is based on plasma thermochemical activation of coal for burning. It consists in arc plasma heating of air-fuel mixture up to the temperature of coa...|$|E
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium model {{was used to}} determine the major species of chromium, lead, cadmium, copper, and zinc formed under various incineration conditions. The effects of temperature and oxygen, chlorine, sulfur, and hydrogen content on the speciation were established by the minimum Gibbs free energy method. Sixty-seven compounds of five metallic species were determined in this study. The simulation conditions included: 1) single metal with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur system; 2) different chlorine and hydrogen content; and 3) comparisons of a single combustion chamber and a <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber. The simulation results indicated that the oxides were the dominant forms in a single metal-oxygen system, while the metallic chlorides were the major species in a metal-chlorine-oxygen system. When sulfur was present, in the case of all metals other than Pb, the metallic sulfates were the major species at temperatures below 1000 K, and metallic oxides were the dominant species above 1000 K. Increasing the temperatures caused a decrease of lead chloride, but increased the formation of other metallic chlorides. The concentrations of metallic chlorides decreased significantly as the hydrogen moles were 2 similar to 3 orders higher than those of chlorine. The level of difference between one-stage and two-stage simulations depends on the species formed in the one-stage simulation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Clinker burning {{process has}} a decisive {{influence}} on energy consumption {{and the cost}} of cement production. A new problem is to use the process of decarbonization of alternative fuels from waste. These issues are particularly important in the introduction of a <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> of fuel in a rotary kiln without the typical reactor-decarbonizator. This work presents results of numerical studies on thermal-hydraulic phenomena in the riser chamber, which will be designed to burn fuel in the system where combustion air is supplied separately from the clinker cooler. The mathematical model is based on a combination of two methods of motion description: Euler description for the gas phase and Lagrange description for particles. Heat transfer between particles of raw material and gas was added to the numerical calculations. The main aim of the research was finding the correct fractional distribution of particles. For assumed particle distribution on the first stage of work, authors noted that all particles were carried away by the upper outlet to the preheater tower, what is not corresponding to the results of experimental studies.

40|$|The article {{contains}} a thermodynamic analysis of a new combustion system that allows the combustion of stratified gas mixtures with mean air excess coefficient in the range 1. 4 - 1. 8. Spark ignition {{was used in the}} pre-chamber that has been mounted in the engine cylinder head and contained a rich mixture out of which a turbulent flow of ignited mixture is ejected. It allows spark-jet ignition and the turbulent combustion of the lean mixture in the main combustion chamber. This resulted in a <b>two-stage</b> <b>combustion</b> system for lean mixtures. The experimental study has been conducted using a single-cylinder test engine with a geometric compression ratio ε = 15. 5 adapted for natural gas supply. The tests were performed at engine speed n = 2000 rpm under stationary engine load when the engine operating parameters and toxic compounds emissions have been recorded. Analysis of the results allowed to conclude that the evaluated combustion system offers large flexibility in the initiation of charge ignition through an appropriate control of the fuel quantities supplied into the pre-chamber and into the main combustion chamber.
