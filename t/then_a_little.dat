First a small layer of coarse concrete, the rudus, <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went onto the pavement or statumen. Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones, called the summa crusta. The crusta was crowned for drainage.|$|E

500|$|In {{reviewing}} Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010 Jack Wallen {{described it}} as [...] "efficient, but different" [...] and noted its problem with crashes. [...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (and <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more than I would have previously. [...] small footprint, fast startup, and clean interface." ...|$|E

500|$|Jeff Gordon {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the 2009 season in front of 176,300 who attended the race. He also earned $541,874 in race winnings. Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E

2500|$|Poirot's {{death was}} {{the end of a long}} journey for me. I had only ever wanted to play Dame Agatha's true Poirot [...] He was as real to me as he had been to her: a great detective, a {{remarkable}} man, if, perhaps, just now and <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> irritating.|$|E

2500|$|According to Timberlake, {{the album}} [...] "goes {{a lot of}} {{different}} directions.
