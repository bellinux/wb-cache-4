5|$|After {{its public}} {{exhibitions}} <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> {{was taken to}} Taylor and Burton in Monaco in November 1969, who were staying on their yacht, the Kalizma, in Monaco's Port Hercules. The diamond's journey to Monaco took three weeks, {{with the use of}} three men with identical briefcases, of which only one held the actual diamond. The men flew from New York to Nice in France, and upon entering Monaco an armed guard with a machine gun gave further protection to <b>the</b> <b>diamond.</b> The couple were in Monaco to celebrate Princess Grace's fortieth birthday at the 'Scorpio Ball', a gala ball held at the Hermitage Hotel in Monte Carlo. The briefcase that contained <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> also held three 50¢ pairs of stockings that Taylor would buy in New York and were unavailable elsewhere, and Taylor was just as excited to receive the stockings as <b>the</b> <b>diamond.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Rundell and Bridge sold <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> to the Emanuel Brothers {{for about}} 7,200 pounds (today about £). Six {{years later in}} 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. At one point, the Marquess mounted <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> in the handle of his dress sword. In 1886, <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} that the auction would take place on 23 October 1969, with <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> listed as lot 133, at Parke-Bernet in New York City. <b>The</b> <b>diamond</b> was flown to Gstaad in Switzerland so that the actress Elizabeth Taylor could see it, and flown back to the United States for the auction. Taylor's husband, the actor Richard Burton, had set a maximum bid of $1 million for <b>the</b> <b>diamond,</b> with his lawyer, Aaron Frosch, bidding on the telephone from London, and Al Yugler of the jewellers Frank Pollock and Sons, bidding in the room for Burton.|$|E

The only additional trick here is that the Ultimate's corner pieces (equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>Diamond's</b> face pieces) are sensitive to orientation, and so may require an additional algorithm for orienting them after being correctly placed.|$|R

5|$|The Nassak Diamond quickly resurfaced in the {{possession}} of Baji Rao II the last independent Indian Peshwa Prince, who handed over <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> to an English colonel named J.

5|$|A $1 million {{insurance}} policy was secured against <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> with Lloyd's of London.

5|$|After initial cutting, <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> {{is shaped}} in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E
