Sometimes a third crop, winter wheat, {{is added to}} the rotation. Fields are usually plowed each year, although no-till farming is increasing in use. Many of the maize varieties grown in the United States and Canada are hybrids. Over half of the corn area planted in the United States has been genetically modified using biotechnology to express agronomic traits such as pest resistance or herbicide resistance.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the intensive, extensive, and dynamic margin response to sustainable agricultural practices. We define sustainable agriculture {{as a system}} in which the resource and pollution stocks associated with production have a steady-state solution consistent with a resource-use path resulting in long run utility maximization. As an empirical application we consider two state variables, fertility levels and groundwater stocks, and a <b>two-crop</b> <b>rotation</b> system, alfalfa-cotton. Agricultural production leads to a fundamental tradeoff represented by the rotation between net-nitrogen using crops and net-nitrogen fixing crops. In addition, nitrogen using crops generally have higher net returns than nitrogen fixing crops, but nitrogen fixing crops have a higher water use per unit revenue. It follows that rotation shifts that favor nitrogen fixing crops result in greater groundwater depletion. To achieve sustainability in this context, one must simultaneously strike a steady-state balance, or at least a repeated cycle, between the rates of fertility change and changes in stocks of groundwater.

Entz Abstract: The {{effects of a}} 4 -year {{crop rotation}} and two tillage systems on blackleg (Leptosphaeria maculans) disease of canola were determined in a field experiment carried out from 1999 through 2002 at Carman, Manitoba. Crops in rotation were canola (Brassica napus) (C), wheat (Triticum aestivum) (W), and flax (Linum usitatissimum) (F). Rotations were done under conventional tillage (T) or zero-till (Z) systems. Diseased stem incidence and severity were assessed. Diseased stem incidence and severity in 2001 and 2002 were significantly lower when canola was rotated with wheat, and rotated with wheat and flax under both tillage systems. The CCCCT rotation had a higher disease incidence than CWCCT, CWFCT, and CCWCT rotations, which {{were not significantly different}} from each other. Zerotill plots had significantly greater diseased stem incidence and severity than tilled plots, with or without rotation. Tillage reduced the disease when it was performed with a simple-crop rotation; however, the effect was reduced with a <b>two-crop</b> <b>rotation.</b> The results suggest that an appropriate rotation and tillage strategy could be effective in reducing the severity of blackleg of canola in farmers â€™ fields...|$|E
40|$|Constant use of treated {{wastewater}} (TWW) {{for irrigation}} over prolonged periods may cause buildup of heavy metals up to toxic levels for plants and animals, and entails environmental hazards in different aspects. However, application of TWWon agricultural land {{might be an}} effective and sustainable strategy in arid and semiarid countries where fresh water resources are under great pressure, as long as potential harmful effects on the environment including soil, plants, and fresh water resources, and health risks to humans are minimized. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of deep emitters on limiting potential heavymetal accumulation in soils and grains, and health risk under drip irrigation with treated municipal wastewater. A field experiment was conducted according to a split block design with two treatments (fresh and wastewater) and three sub-treatments (0, 15, and 30 cm depth of emitters) in four replicates on a sandy loam Calcic Argigypsids, in Esfahan, Iran. The annual rainfall is about 123 mm, mean annual ETo is 1457 mm, and the elevation is 1590 m above sea level. A <b>two-crop</b> <b>rotation</b> of wheat (Triticum spp.) and corn (Zea mays) was established on each plot with wheat growing from February to June and corn from July to September. Soil samples were collected before planting and after harvesting for each crop in each year. Edible grain samples of corn and wheat were collected at harvest. Elemental concentrations (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni) in soil and grains were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in the wastewaterirrigated soils were not significantly different (P> 0. 05) compared with the freshwater-irrigated soils. No significant difference (P> 0. 05) in heavy metal content in soil between different depths of emitters was found. A pollution load index (PLI) showed that there was no substantial buildup of heavy metals in the wastewater- irrigated soils compared to the freshwater-irrigated soils. Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations in wheat and corn grains were within the permissible US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits, but concentrations of Cd (in wheat and corn) and Cr (in corn) were above the safe limits of the EPA. In addition, concentrations of Ni in wheat and corn seeds were several folds higher than the EPA standards. A health risk index (HRI) which is usually adopted to assess the health risk to hazard materials in foods showed values higher than 1 for Cd, particularly for wheat grain (HRI > 2. 5). Results also showed that intake of Cu through consumption of edible wheat grains posed a relatively high potential health risk to children (HRI > 1. 4), whereas children might also be exposed to health risk from Cd and Cr from corn grains (HRI > 1. 4). Based on aforementioned results, it can be concluded that the emitter depth in drip irrigation does not play a significant role in the accumulation of heavy metals from TWWin our sandy loam soil. Although their accumulation in the soil was limited and similar to using freshwater, uptake of Cd and Cr by wheat and cornwas relatively large and hence resulted in health risk. The results suggest that more attention should be directed towards cultivation of other crops with drip irrigation system for a safe and more productive use of wastewater for irrigation. Alternatively, methods that filter the wastewater before it enters the soil environment might be an option that needs further investigation...|$|E
