5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only automatic train control. This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E
5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would {{have pushed the}} budget to $50million. While they tried {{to hold on to}} the opening as long as they could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|At {{the meeting}} for the Formula One Commission in Geneva in November 2011, the use of helium in air guns used to change tyres during pit stops was banned. Despite {{increasing}} the rotation speed of the air guns by up to 30%, the practice of using helium was deemed to be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> continue for the competitive gains it offered.|$|E
50|$|It was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for growers <b>to</b> {{purchase}} the wine presses and bottling lines necessary {{to produce a}} finished wine.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{trolleybus}} transport {{was seen}} <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> compared <b>to</b> the conventional diesel option, {{and therefore the}} City of Helsinki decided to discontinue the trolleybus service and replace it by diesel buses. The SWS trolleybus was kept for possible further investigation.|$|R
50|$|The PlayPump {{received}} heavy {{publicity and}} funding when first introduced, but {{has since been}} criticized for being <b>too</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>too</b> complex <b>to</b> maintain or repair in low-resource settings, too reliant on child labor, and overall less effective than traditional handpumps. WaterAid, {{one of the biggest}} water charities in the world, opposes the PlayPump for these reasons.|$|R
5|$|In 1992, the {{transport}} authorities of Oslo decided to close Nordberg and Frøen stations, {{on the grounds}} that these stations were <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> maintain. The platforms at Vestgrensa were moved a few metres to adjust to the metro trains. Seven years later, on 22 August 1999, Vestgrensa was closed and replaced with the newly opened Forskningsparken Station.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} {{could still be}} assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> maintain.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Banks, {{the story}} {{involved}} the Sixth Doctor and Peri encountering the Master in Ancient Crete, {{as well as}} a contingent of Cybermen. David Banks, who had played the Cyber Leader in three serials in the early 1980s, submitted this storyline around the time that ‘Attack Of The Cybermen’ entered production in 1984. Script editor Eric Saward liked the idea, but felt that it would prove <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> film.|$|E

5000|$|Open-spandrel {{concrete}} arch bridges {{were built}} in the early 1900s in areas where concrete was not <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> relative <b>to</b> alternatives and where the span would be sufficiently high so that the arch could span the requisite distance. (Truss bridges can be built lower.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I don't {{want to wake}} up," [...] he chortled, as he hefted {{the various}} sacks. [...] "Toted up, it's a seventy thousan' dream. It'd be <b>too</b> blamed <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> open my eyes, roll out of the blankets, an' start breakfast." ...|$|R
5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{the comic}} strip stories' {{holographic}} characters, predominately Rimmer, were drawn in grayscale. This was {{at the request of}} Grant and Naylor, who had wanted to use the technique for the television series, but the process was deemed <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce. Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month, the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications. A farewell issue was published, cover dated January 1994, and featured the remaining interviews, features, and comic strips that were to feature in the following issues.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Ampeg-branded guitars and basses were {{produced}} by Burns of London, but these instruments did not sell well, because {{the cost of}} importing the instruments made them <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> compared <b>to</b> Fenders and Gibsons. Baldwin's purchase of Burns in 1965 ended the association with Ampeg.|$|R
50|$|Kyaghala is {{a village}} in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On February 16, 2017, the Maï-Maï Mazembe (members of the Nande, Hunde and Kobo tribes) killed 25 Hutu villagers who {{had been forced to}} migrate to this area after their land in Rwanda had become <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> due <b>to</b> speculation.|$|R
50|$|Ice bank bulk {{tanks are}} {{better suited for}} small family farm {{operations}} where only single-phase electric power is available, and high-power cooling systems would be either <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> or difficult <b>to</b> install.|$|R
5|$|The first {{fortification}} at Camber {{may have}} been built shortly after 1486 by Sir Richard Guldeford, the Master of the Ordnance, who was given the manor of Higham by King Henry VII in exchange for Richard constructing a tower to protect the anchorage. There is no surviving evidence, however, to show if a tower was in fact built as Guldeford had promised, and Henry VII did not invest much in his coastal defences {{during the rest of}} his reign. Many castles across England were left in poor repair, often considered to be outdated and <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> maintain.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} LP {{cover was}} designed as a spoof of a 12x16-inch (305x406mm) 12-page small-town English newspaper, entitled The St. Cleve Chronicle and Linwell Advertiser, with articles, competitions and advertisements lampooning the typical parochial and amateurish journalism of the local English press. The band's record company, Chrysalis Records, complained that the sleeve would be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce, but Anderson countered that if a real newspaper could be produced, a parody of one would also be practical.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it proved more popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> operate. The service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. Around 1,900 to 2,100 riders use the service every weekday depending on the season.|$|E
50|$|Accoutrements {{are widely}} {{collected}} by militaria collectors and historical re-enactors. Some accoutrements used by re-enactors are reproductions, as the originals {{may no longer}} be available or <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> or valuable <b>to</b> use.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his death}} on 21 February 1788 Palitzsch {{left behind a}} library of 3518 books, partly {{consisting}} of handwritten copies he had created from scientific works <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for him <b>to</b> purchase.|$|R
50|$|Finally, the Court {{rejected}} all {{arguments that}} the law was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> or disadvantageous <b>to</b> rural regions, as these were matters for Parliament to consider rather than legal issues liable to judicial review.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} {{illuminated}} by two-tierd bronze chandeliers, each featuring 12 distinct lighting groups holding candle-like bulbs. The chandeliers, designed by Stanislav Adamenko and Mariya Ralko, were installed between the mosaic stripes. Both the station halls and the underground vestibule feature similar light fixtures, {{although they are}} significantly smaller than the main chandeliers. The redesign also called for a gold smalt-covered ceiling, although this was rejected as it was <b>too</b> <b>expensive.</b> <b>To</b> finish it off, gray granite was used on the floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{success of}} the pressurized water reactor, he wrote, was due less to any superior characteristics of water, but rather to the decision to power the prototype of the Mark I submarine thermal reactor with a pressurized version of the Materials Testing Reactor at Oak Ridge. Once pressurized water was established, other possibilities became <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> pursue, but Weinberg remained interested in other possibilities. According to Freeman Dyson, {{he was the only}} nuclear pioneer who supported the wide universe of reactor designs.|$|E
5|$|Before the Washington Naval Conference concluded, the ship's {{construction}} was suspended in February 1922, {{when she was}} 24.2 percent complete. She was re-designated and re-authorized as an aircraft carrier on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced {{by a total of}} , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406mm) guns in four twin turrets (including their heavy turret mounts, their armor, and other equipment). The main armor belt was retained, but was reduced in height to save weight. The general line of the hull remained unaltered, as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built, {{and it would have been}} <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> alter them.|$|E
6000|$|Throughout {{the dinner}} Eddie Swanson had been complaining, publicly, about his wife's new frock. It was, he submitted, too short, too low, too immodestly thin, and much <b>too</b> <b>expensive.</b> He appealed <b>to</b> Babbitt: ...|$|R
25|$|Culpeper {{believed}} {{medicine was}} a public asset rather than a commercial secret, and the prices physicians charged were far <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> compared <b>to</b> the cheap and universal availability of nature's medicine. He felt the use of Latin and expensive fees charged by doctors, lawyers and priests worked to keep power and freedom from the general public.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars with non-axisymmetric rotational motion using data from ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors, {{the development of a}} computationally efficient algorithm for analysis of this data and the use of this algorithm in follow up searches, which were previously <b>too</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> consider...|$|R
5|$|Biehn was hastily cast a {{week after}} filming had commenced, and thus was not present for the {{military}} training that the other actors playing marines went through James Remar was originally cast as Hicks but left the project over creative differences with Cameron. In an interview on episode #128 of the Sidebar podcast, Remar stated that he was replaced due to being fired after {{he was arrested for}} drug possession. Only a few shots of him remain in the film, which is where the team first enters the alien hive, only his back is seen. This was because those sequences were <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> re-shoot.|$|E
5|$|By May 1985, {{three months}} behind schedule, the review board narrowed the tenders {{down to two}} contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The Walrus and Type 2400submarine designs were {{considered}} to be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system tenders had been narrowed down by unjustified development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti proposals, and the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided that six submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.|$|E
5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
50|$|The split largely {{followed}} county lines, {{with the}} notable exception of Oldsmar, most of which stayed in 813. Oldsmar's trunk is wired into the Tampa line, {{and it would have}} been <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for GTE <b>to</b> rewire it.|$|R
5000|$|Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (1984-1994) {{then turned}} to ITCC by the FIA in 1995, based in heavily {{modified}} cars, began <b>to</b> be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> and due <b>to</b> retirement from Opel and Alfa Romeo the ITCC series were cancelled in 1996.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{pyrophoric}} substance, diborane reacts exothermically {{with oxygen}} to form boron trioxide and water, {{so much that}} it was considered as a possible rocket or ramjet propellant but discarded because back then it was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> and dangerous <b>to</b> handle: ...|$|R
