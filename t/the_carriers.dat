50|$|Damage to <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> is {{repaired}} by {{the automatic}} repair system. <b>The</b> <b>carrier</b> is divided up into several systems. With {{the exception of}} <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> superstructure and <b>the</b> automatic repair system itself {{it is possible to}} fully repair any of <b>the</b> <b>carrier's</b> systems from 100% damage. <b>The</b> <b>carrier</b> is destroyed when damage to the superstructure reaches 100%, resulting in the loss of the game. Damage to the components is done according to where the impacts are on the carrier.For example, a hit from a missile to the rear side of <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> will do heavy damage to both the engine and docking bay, but will do little or no damage to the other components of the ship. The player can set the repair priorities for each part of <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> that will determine which parts will be repaired first. Any component except the automatic repair system that has over 50% damage will not work. Some components that are damaged will operate less efficiently.If the engine is damaged for example, <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> {{will not be able to}} move as fast. If damaged, the laser turret will heat up faster and cool down slower so it will not be able to fire as frequently. The repair system repairs <b>the</b> <b>carrier</b> slower if it is damaged.|$|R
