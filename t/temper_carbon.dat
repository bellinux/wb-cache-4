50|$|In {{order to}} {{properly}} form the spherical-shaped nodules of graphite (called temper graphite nodules or <b>temper</b> <b>carbon</b> nodules) in the annealing process, {{care must be}} taken to ensure that the iron casting will solidify with an entirely white iron cross section. Thicker sections of a casting will cool slowly, allowing some primary graphite to form. This graphite forms random flake-like structures and will not transform to carbide during heat treatment. When stress is applied to such a casting in application, the fracture strength will be lower than expected for white iron. Such iron is said to have a 'mottled' appearance. Some countermeasures can be applied to enhance the formation of the all white structure, but malleable iron foundries often avoid producing heavy sections.|$|E

Three series of fatigue specimens with zero, 0. 15 and 0. 45 mm depth of decarburization were produced. Half of the specimens from each series were shot peened, leading to a thickness of the compressed surface layer of about 0. 25 mm. The specimens were tested in bending fatigue.

50|$|However, during tempering, {{elements}} like chromium, vanadium, and molybdenum precipitate {{with the}} carbon. If the steel contains fairly low concentrations of these elements, the softening {{of the steel}} can be retarded until much higher temperatures are reached, when compared to those needed for <b>tempering</b> <b>carbon</b> steel. This allows the steel to maintain its hardness in high temperature or high friction applications. However, this also requires very high temperatures during tempering, to achieve a reduction in hardness. If the steel contains large amounts of these elements, tempering may produce an increase in hardness until a specific temperature is reached, {{at which point the}} hardness will begin to decrease. For instance, molybdenum steels will typically reach their highest hardness around 315 C whereas vanadium steels will harden fully when tempered to around 371 C. When very large amounts of solutes are added, alloy steels may behave like precipitation hardening alloys, which do not soften at all during tempering.|$|R

Attention is focused on reducing the weight and stresses keeping into considerations the various critical points.

Optimization of spring helps in selecting most appropriate and cost effective material for spring.

It {{is important to}} develop a mathematical model for quenching and tempering process for satisfy requirement of mechanical properties with low cost. This paper presents a modified model to predict structural evolution and hardness distribution during quenching and tempering process of steels. The model takes into account <b>tempering</b> parameters, <b>carbon</b> content, isothermal and non-isothermal transformations. Moreover, precipitation of transition carbides, decomposition of retained austenite and precipitation of cementite can be simulated respectively. Hardness distributions of quenched and tempered workpiece are predicted by experimental regression equation. In order to validate the model, it is employed to predict the tempering of 80 MnCr 5 steel.

Then the model is implemented {{within the framework of the}} developed simulation code COSMAP to simulate microstructure, stress and distortion in the heat treated component. It is applied to simulate Q&T process of J 55 steel. The calculated results show a good agreement with the experimental ones. This agreement indicates that the model is effective for simulation of Q&T process of steels...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{approach}} {{is to increase the}} amount of austenite during low-temperature austenite reversion heat treatment. The heat treatment starts with a complete austenitization and carbides solution treatment. Water quenching to room temperature is followed after this solution treatment. During a subsequent heat treatment in the range of 300 °C- 500 °C, austenite reversion takes place on the basis of partial partitioning according to local equilibrium, segregation and kinetic freezing of carbon among different phases. This austenite reversion treatment was applied in two kinds of martensitic stainless steels: Fe- 13 Cr- 0. 4 C (X 44 Cr 13, 1. 4034, AISI 420) and Fe- 13 Cr- 0. 2 C (X 21 Cr 13, 1. 4021, AISI 420) (wt. %). In the high carbon steel (Fe- 13 Cr- 0. 4 C), austenite reversion heat treatment at 400 °C gives the material a significant increase in ductility without drastically strength decrease (e. g. heat treated at 400 °C for 30 min results in a UTS of 1. 75 GPa with an elongation of 23 %). Concerning the whole austenite reversion treatment, carbon concentration and its distribution are the key factors. During quenching, in the vicinity of martensite-austenite interfaces, carbon segregates from the supersaturated martensite to both, the hetero-interfaces and to homophase grain boundaries. During austenite reversion <b>tempering,</b> <b>carbon</b> continuously diffuse to martensite-austenite interfaces, driving the carbon-enriched areas towards austenite reversion. It is worthy to point out that the fast nanoscale austenite reversion is attributed to an effect that is referred to as kinetic freezing of carbon. This means that the carbon is fast inside the martensite when leaving it but slow (and, hence, frozen) when entering the austenite. Carbon becomes trapped and highly enriched at the martensite-austenite interfaces owing to its low mobility within the austenite during low-temperature partitioning. This provides a much higher local driving force for austenite reversion. This means that the formation of nanoscaled reverted austenite depends mainly on the local but not on the global chemical potential of carbon at internal interfaces. Carbon inside martensite, far away from any interfaces, tends to form M 3 C carbides. The austenite reversion process, nano-carbide precipitation, and carbon segregation have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) in order to develop the structure-property relationships that control the material's strength and ductility. 3 D reconstructions of samples at different stages during austenite reversion treatment were established base on the APT results especially at the interfaces. In the low carbon steel (Fe- 13 Cr- 0. 2 C), austenite reversion in the investigated temperature range (300 °C- 500 °C) is difficult to proceed due to the lack of <b>carbon</b> content. Simple <b>tempering</b> of the quenched martensite is the main process of this steel when heat-treated at 400 °C...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} oxygen and phosphorus dynamics at a seasonally hypoxic {{site in the}} Arkona basin of the Baltic Sea. A coupled benthic–pelagic reactive-transport model is {{used to describe the}} evolution of bottom-water solute concentrations, as well as pore-water and sediment profiles. Aerobic respiration dominates remineralization, with iron reduction, denitrification, and sulphate reduction playing secondary roles, while other pathways are negligible. Sediments represent a significant oxygen sink chiefly due to the aerobic degradation of organic matter, as well as nitrification and iron oxyhydroxide precipitation. Most phosphorus deposited in sediments is in organic matter, yet cycling is dominated by iron-bound phosphorus due to rapid dissimilatory iron reduction coupled with aerobic iron oxyhydroxide formation. Sustained hypoxia results in an initial decrease in sediment phosphorus content due to dissolution of phosphorus-bearing iron oxyhydroxides, resulting in a pulse of phosphate to overlying waters. Although an organic-rich layer is formed under low-oxygen conditions, enhanced remineralization of organic phosphorus relative to organic <b>carbon</b> <b>tempers</b> sedimentary phosphorus accumulation. Upon reoxygenation of bottom waters after a decade of sustained hypoxia, oxygen concentrations do not immediately achieve values observed prior to hypoxia because the organic-rich layer creates a higher benthic oxygen demand. Artificial reoxygenation of bottom waters leads to a substantial increase in the iron-bound phosphorus pool; the total phosphorus content of the sediment, however, is unaffected. A relapse into hypoxia would consequently produce a large pulse of phosphate to the overlying waters potentially exacerbating the situation...|$|R
