5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books {{that were in the}} cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{during an}} {{excavation}} by South Trafford Archaeological Group, fragments of Roman pottery {{were found in}} the area now occupied by the cemetery – previously the site of Urmston Old Hall – suggesting <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Roman settlement on the site. In the early 13th century, Lord Greenhalgh and his family lived at Highfield House (under what is now the M60 motorway).|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E

50|$|Anthony Godby Johnson is {{the subject}} and {{supposed}} author of the 1993 memoir A Rock and a Hard Place: One Boy's Triumphant Story. Subsequent investigations suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> never been a person by this name, and that his entire story was a fabrication {{on the part of}} Vicki Johnson, the woman who purported to be his adoptive mother.|$|R
25|$|A few {{indicators}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> existed, in {{the same}} location, another structure, likely a temple to the goddess Nabia (as yet undiscovered). The figure in the toga could represent the god Asclepius. Francisco Sande Lemos, suggests that the fountain was paired with the sanctuary of Fragas de Panóias in Vila Real, {{one of the more}} familiar monuments of Roman rock-art epigraphy in the Iberian northwest.|$|R
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|To {{fill the}} void left by {{the demise of the}} Susquehannocks, the Iroquois {{encouraged}} displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware). The valleys of Pine Creek and its tributaries in Cummings Township were used by the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes as a hunting ground. Historians believe <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Shawnee village and burial ground just to the north of Little Pine State Park on Little Pine Creek, {{just a few miles from}} what became Upper Pine Bottom State Park.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where the bodies were being buried, who claimed there was the possibility <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more than one body in each coffin. The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
5000|$|His poems {{were most}} likely written before the concept of ideal courtly love was formulated. As their subject they have a more direct and less stylized relationship. Some are in {{dialogue}} form (Wechsel). The best known poem is the [...] "falcon song". It is possible that both stanzas were spoken by a woman [...] His poetry, {{as well as that}} of Dietmar von Eist (Aist), suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> existed a poetic form indigenous to the Upper Germany/Austria territory before the impact of the Provençal influence.|$|R

60|$|She had {{attracted}} the jew's notice, {{and it is}} not impossible <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> stirred in him a desire to avenge upon her some of the cruel wrongs, some of the rackings, burning, confiscations, and banishment suffered by the men of his race {{at the hands of the}} men of hers. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> bethought him of invaded ghettos, of Jewish maidens ravished, and Jewish children butchered in the name of the God those Spanish Christians worshipped, for there was something almost of contemptuous fierceness in his dark eyes and in the hand he flung out to indicate her.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} small finds of Roman coins {{throughout}} the Sheffield area, for example 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in Pitsmoor in 1906, and ten coins {{were found at}} a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along {{with the name of}} the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Roman camp at this site. It is unlikely that the settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian farmstead site at Whirlow Hall Farm in South-west Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Xinhua News Agency {{published}} an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual {{by the name of}} Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died. Xinhua alleged that Gui Minhai (桂敏海), with a different but identical-sounding middle character with respect to Gui Minhai the publisher, had fled abroad under the guise of a tourist in November 2004 using a borrowed identity card following the court case; his stated age was 46 years in 2005 – a discrepancy of five years compared with the details in Gui's Swedish passport. The two discrepancies created doubts <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015.|$|E

5000|$|The {{small body}} of {{evidence}} available for Runic texts suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> a been a separate locative case in early or Northumbrian forms of the language (e.g., [...] on rodi [...] "on the Cross").|$|R
50|$|The present 13th-century castle, {{with its}} {{prominent}} keep, succeeded a castle {{built in the}} 11th century, and an earlier foundation, built from 991 to 1015. The castle is a rectilinear pentagonal plan, with five surviving towers, {{one of which is}} much larger than the rest and serves as the keep, forming the point of the pentagon, {{at the end of the}} ridge. A gate tower protected the entrance on the opposite site. Recent evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> a second court or bailey extending in front of the present gate, as well as a substantial chapel inside the presumed lower court.|$|R
500|$|Marceline {{shares a}} rocky {{relationship}} with Princess Bubblegum. Initially, {{in the series}} bible, the two were described as [...] "friendly rivals" [...] competing for Finn's attention. However, as the show has gone on, their relationship has been fleshed out and changed. Marceline {{was the first person}} to address Bubblegum by her first name—Bonnibel—which occurred in the episode [...] "Go with Me". Their connections are explored further in the season three episode [...] "What Was Missing". In the episode, Marceline's song [...] "I'm Just Your Problem" [...] and the dialogue between her and Bubblegum implied <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> had some sort of relationship in the past, although the exact details surrounding the nature of the relationship were not explained. This later caused an internet controversy over Marceline's sexual orientation. However, after the events of [...] "What Was Missing", Marceline and Bubblegum's relationship seems to have gotten better, as the two spend quality time together in [...] "Sky Witch", [...] "Varmints", Stakes, and [...] "Broke His Crown".|$|R
25|$|A {{childhood}} friend of Foley's, Jon Ombres, confirmed the close friendship between the two, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a second priest, sexually interested in youths {{and with whom}} Foley was on good terms, active in the parish at that time.|$|E
25|$|An article {{published}} in Caijing in May 2007 hinted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> impropriety: Profits were siphoned off into factories and other external ventures in breach of the joint venture agreement; shareholdings were shuffled around {{to the detriment of}} other shareholders.|$|E
25|$|After the accident, the {{new city}} of Slavutych was built outside the {{exclusion}} zone to house {{and support the}} employees of the plant, which was decommissioned in 2000. A report prepared by the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Health Organization attributed 56 direct deaths to the accident and estimated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> 4,000 extra cancer deaths.|$|E
50|$|Cline also {{suggests}} the possibility <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been a historical battle of Megiddo involving Josiah, since there's little historical attestation for it outside the Bible. For example, Josiah <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{been killed by}} Necho in some other circumstances.|$|R
50|$|The {{estate was}} the {{property}} of Tewkesbury Abbey until {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries. It was then sold and became part of the Stanway estate. There is some archaeological evidence <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> once <b>have</b> been a settlement around the chapel.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{parts of}} the {{presently}} visible church is the nave, dating from the late 12th century. Oak planks decorated with dragons have however been found on the site, and indicate <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> existed an earlier, wooden church on the spot. The tower dates from the early 13th century, and {{from the end of}} the same century dates the un-proportionally large choir and sacristy. The choir replaced an earlier, smaller choir, but plans to replace also the nave were never carried out. The church has not been substantially altered since the Middle Ages. The windows date from 1865 and the church was renovated in 1964-65.|$|R
25|$|Historian Christopher Snyder {{wrote that}} {{protocol}} dictated that Honorius address his correspondences to imperial officials, {{and the fact}} that he did not implies that the cities of Britain were now the highest Roman authority remaining on the island. The idea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> larger-scale political formations still intact on the island has not been completely discredited however.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a two-pronged attack by Godwinson on Hardrada's army, {{making use of}} both the ford and perhaps {{the remnants of the}} earlier Roman bridge one mile to the south, information of which, and of the two road routes to the location from York, could have been gathered from Godwinson's earlier occupation of the city of York. However, no documentation exists to support this possibility.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{fittings}} {{include a}} mid 13th-century piscina which is joined to three sedilia by continuous moulded scrollwork. Above this, two blocked archways rise and {{meet at a}} corbel carved with a sheep's head. This may be Norman and {{could have come from}} elsewhere in the church. There are also carvings representing monks' heads supporting statues. Apart from the main piscina, two others survive elsewhere in the church, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> two subsidiary altars at one point.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} a village {{on the site of}} Cleadon for over a {{thousand}} years. Cleadon has a traditional village pond which is the remnants of an ice age lake and dates to Roman times, and an early history of South Shields suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> once been a Roman watchtower or turret on Cleadon Hills. The name of the village is derived from 'Cliffa-dun' meaning a hill with a cliff, which over years became Clevendona, Clyvedon (recorded in 1280), Clevedon, and in the 17th century Cleydon. The village was first mentioned in print in the Boldon Book, a survey of the local area completed in 1183.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} that Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and {{evidence}} from Bornais suggests <b>that</b> settlers <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly due to a more relaxed political regime.|$|R

25|$|The {{pamphlet}} Answer to Dr. Priestley's Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1782) {{is considered}} to be the first published declaration of atheism in Britain—plausibly the first in English (as distinct from covert or cryptically atheist works). The otherwise unknown William Hammon (possibly a pseudonym) signed the preface and postscript as editor of the work, and the anonymous main text is attributed to Matthew Turner (d. 1788?), a Liverpool physician who may have known Priestley. Historian of atheism David Berman has argued strongly for Turner's authorship, but also suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> two authors.|$|E
25|$|The Dorset/Thule culture {{transition}} dates {{around the}} 9th–10th centuries. Scientists theorize <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cross-contact {{of the two}} cultures with sharing of technology, such as fashioning harpoon heads, or the Thule may have found Dorset remnants and adapted their ways with the predecessor culture. Others believe the Thule displaced the Dorset. By 1300, the Inuit, present-day Arctic inhabitants and descendants of Thule culture, had settled in west Greenland, and moved into east Greenland over the following century. Over time, the Inuit have migrated throughout the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland, Russia, and the United States.|$|E
500|$|The area of Caffo's death {{became known}} {{at some point}} as Llangaffo, and a church was {{established}} there: the Welsh word [...] "" [...] originally meant [...] "enclosure" [...] and then [...] "church", and [...] "-gaffo" [...] is a modified form of the saint's name. It is thought <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> at one point been a monastery in this location, known as [...] "Merthyr Caffo" [...] (Merthyr being the Welsh word for [...] "martyr"). Caffo is venerated as a saint, although he was never canonized by a pope: as the historian Jane Cartwright notes, [...] "In Wales sanctity was locally conferred {{and none of the}} medieval Welsh saints appears to have been canonized by the Roman Catholic Church".|$|R

5000|$|In 2014, {{large-scale}} protests {{took place}} in New York City following the deaths of Eric Garner in Staten Island, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Akai Gurley in Brooklyn. The protests got bigger after grand juries in Ferguson and in Staten Island separately decided not to file criminal charges against the police officers, {{who were involved in}} the chokehold death of Garner and the shooting death of Brown, respectively. In response to these protests, the NYPD made large numbers of arrests and deployed the uses of pepper spray and mobile LRADs to disrupt activists, long regarded by many as controversial. Use of LRADs by the NYPD triggered legal objections on the basis <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> never been [...] "formal guidelines for the devices’ use".|$|R
