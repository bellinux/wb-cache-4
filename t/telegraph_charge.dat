40|$|The radio {{frequency}} single electron transistor (rf-SET) possesses key requirements necessary for reading out a solid state quantum computer. This work explores {{the use of}} the rf-SET as a single-shot readout device in the presence of 1 /f and <b>telegraph</b> <b>charge</b> noise. For a typical spectrum of 1 /f noise we find that high fidelity, single-shot measurements are possible for signals q > 0. 01 e. For the case of telegraph noise, we present a cross-correlation measurement technique that uses two rf-SETs to suppress the effect of random switching events on readout. We demonstrate this technique by monitoring the charge state of a metal double dot system on microsecond time-scales. Such a scheme will be advantageous in achieving high readout fidelity in a solid state quantum computer. Comment: Updated and revised version (content including Figs updated).

50|$|SMS {{language}} {{is similar to}} that used by those sending <b>telegraphs</b> that <b>charged</b> by the word. It seeks to use the fewest number of letters to produce ultra-concise words and sentiments in dealing with space, time and cost constraints of text messaging. This follows from how early SMS permitted only 160 characters and some carriers charge messages by the number of characters sent.|$|R
50|$|It {{originated}} in the telegraph age when telecommunication consisted only of short messages transmitted by hand over the telegraph wire. The <b>telegraph</b> companies <b>charged</b> for their service {{by the number of}} words in a message, with a maximum of 15 characters per word for a plain-language telegram, and 10 per word for one written in code. The style developed to minimize costs but still convey the message clearly and unambiguously.|$|R

Subsequently, with the Royal Decree 5973 of 10 March 1889, the Directorate General of Posts and Telegraphs was separated from the Ministry of Public Works and thus transformed into the Ministry of Posts and <b>Telegraphs,</b> in <b>charge</b> of providing Italy with a network of offices to forward and receive mail and telegrams, to make and receive telephone calls, and to carry out financial transactions and asset management. It also for a time worked as branch offices for the nascent electric services.|$|R

He was an American {{confidence}} man whose gang, 200 to 300 strong, cheated and stole from the prospectors travelling through the region. He maintained the illusion of being an upstanding member of the community, opening three saloons as well as creating fake businesses to assist in his operations. One of his scams was a fake <b>telegraph</b> office <b>charging</b> to send messages all over the US and Canada, often pretending to receive a reply. Opposition to Smith steadily grew and, after weeks of vigilante activity, he was killed in Skagway during the shootout on Juneau Wharf on July 8, 1898.|$|R

A registered address also costs a guinea, so, you see, telegraphic correspondence with India is expensive. Business men have therefore fallen on the plan of writing out lists of words, each of which means a longish sentence. This plan is so thoroughly carried out that books like thick dictionaries are now printed and regularly used.--What would you think, now, of `Obstinate Kangaroo' for a message?" ...|$|R

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{commercial}} code is a code once used {{to save on}} cablegram costs. <b>Telegraph</b> (and telex) <b>charged</b> per word sent, so companies which sent large volumes of telegrams developed codes to save money on tolls. Elaborate commercial codes which encoded complete phrases into single words were developed and published as codebooks of thousands of phrases and sentences with corresponding codewords. Commercial codes were not generally intended to keep telegrams private, as codes were widely published; they were usually cost-saving measures only.|$|R
2500|$|Between 1897 and 1898, Skagway was a lawless town, {{described}} by {{one member of}} the North-West Mounted Police as [...] "little better than a hell on earth." [...] Fights, prostitutes and liquor were ever-present on Skagway's streets, and con man [...] "Soapy" [...] Smith, who had risen to considerable power, did little to stop it. Smith was a sophisticated swindler who liked to think of himself as a kind and generous benefactor to the needy. He was gracious to some, giving money to widows and halting lynchings, while simultaneously operating a ring of thieves who swindled prospectors with cards, dice, and the shell game. His <b>telegraph</b> office <b>charged</b> five dollars to send a message anywhere in the world. Consequently, unknowing prospectors sent news to their families back home without realizing there was no telegraph service to or from Skagway until 1901. Smith also controlled a comprehensive spy network, a private militia called the Skaguay Military Company, the town newspaper, the Deputy U.S. Marshal's office and an array of thieves and con-men who roamed about the town. Smith was shot and killed by Frank Reid and Jesse Murphy on July 8, 1898, in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf. Smith managed to return fire— some accounts claim the two men fired their weapons simultaneously— and Frank Reid died from his wounds twelve days later. Jesse Murphy is accredited as the man responsible for killing Smith. Smith and Reid are now interred at the Klondike Gold Rush Cemetery, also known as [...] "Skagway's Boot Hill." ...|$|R
