[...] Though [...] "useless as regards his profession", for [...] "a man of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an opportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few". The Admiralty would look after him well, but [...] "you & Charles... must decide." [...] Charles begged [...] "one favour... a decided answer, yes or no." [...] This reply was sent post-haste early on the morning of 1 September and Charles went shooting. About 10 o'clock he received word from his uncle that they should go to The Mount at once. When they arrived a few hours later, Charles' father had decided that he would give [...] "all the assistance in my power".|$|E
