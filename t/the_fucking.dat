Like the bands that are <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> hardest rocking are like, 'We'll fucking kick your ass, dude... with our rock.'"

500|$|In 1985, Thompson {{was cast}} in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay. It {{provided}} a breakthrough in her career, as the production earned rave reviews. She {{played the role of}} Sally Smith for 15 months, which exhausted the actress; she [...] later remarked [...] "I thought if I did <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> [...] "Lambeth Walk" [...] one more time I was going to fucking throw up."

500|$|Slashdotters {{often use}} the {{abbreviation}} TFA {{which stands for}} <b>The</b> <b>fucking</b> article or [...] ("Read <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> article"), which itself {{is derived from the}} abbreviation RTFM. Usage of this abbreviation often exposes comments from posters who have not read the article linked to in the main story. Slashdotters typically like to mock then United States Senator Ted Stevens' 2006 description of the Internet as a [...] "series of tubes" [...] or former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's chair-throwing incident from 2005. Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a popular target of jokes by Slashdotters, and all stories about Microsoft were once identified with a graphic of Gates looking like a Borg from [...] Many Slashdotters have long talked about the supposed release of Duke Nukem Forever, which was promised in 1997 but was delayed indefinitely (the game was eventually released in 2011). References to the game are commonly brought up in other articles about software packages that are not yet in production even though the announced delivery date has long passed (see vaporware). Having a low Slashdot user identifier (user ID) is highly valued since they are assigned sequentially; having one is a sign that someone has an older account and has contributed to the site longer. For Slashdot's 10-year anniversary in 2007, one of the items auctioned off in the charity auction for the Electronic Frontier Foundation was a 3-digit Slashdot user ID.|$|E
500|$|Abebe is {{also the}} subject of a 2009 feature film, Atletu (The Athlete) {{directed}} by Davey Frankel and Rasselas Lakew. The film starring Rasselas focuses on the final years of Abebe's life: his quest to regain the Olympic title, the accident and his struggle to compete again. Robin Williams referred to Abebe's barefoot running during his 2009 stand-up comedy tour, Weapons of Self-Destruction: [...] " [...] won the Rome Olympics running barefoot. He was then sponsored by Adidas. He ran the next Olympics; he carried <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> shoes". Of course, Abebe did not actually carry his shoes but wore them; he was not sponsored by Adidas but was perhaps secretly sponsored by Puma.|$|E

500|$|Yorke {{has said}} that the album's lyrics are based on [...] "that {{anonymous}} fear thing, sitting in traffic, thinking, 'I'm sure I'm supposed to be doing something else' ... it's similar to OK Computer in a way. It's much more terrifying." [...] At the same time, Yorke felt [...] "there's very little anger in In Rainbows. It's in no way political, or, at least, doesn't feel that way to me. It very much explores the ideas of transience. It starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different." [...] In another interview, Yorke said the album was [...] "about <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> panic of realising you're going to die! And that any time soon [...] possibly [...] a heart attack when I next go for a run." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{has stated}} {{that he had to}} {{overcome}} considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: [...] "I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to go up <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E

Then one guy looked at us and said, 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.'

[...] Randle further laments the loss due to the background of many of his teammates, whom he described as [...] "misfits, guys who just got their second chance." [...] Beyond Moss's legal troubles, Carter had been released by the Philadelphia Eagles early in his career for substance abuse issues, and Cunningham was released by the Eagles and remained unsigned to a team two seasons prior. Randle himself was considered undersized coming out of college and was not heavily pursued by NFL teams.|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E

[...] In an article for Wired News, Regina Lynn noted that the presence of Fucking Machines at the 2007 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo was a move to the mainstream for the website: [...] "The website has been around for years, in that grey area of 'indie internet kink' the Industry doesn't quite understand.

500|$|The Nation of Ulysses was an American {{punk rock}} band from Washington, D.C., formed in spring 1988 with four members.

500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was {{involved}} in, as hinted {{in the opening}} couplet: [...] "I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me". Though Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave, or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] was a sarcastic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue (e.g. in guitarist Peter Asher's bedroom). McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: [...] "In our world the guy had {{to have some sort}} of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental." ...|$|E
500|$|In the prison's {{exercise}} yard, {{the prisoners}} were watching a football match. Shortly after 3:35pm the helicopter swung in to land in the prison yard, with Kevin Mallon directing the pilot using semaphore. A prison officer on duty initially took no action as he believed the helicopter contained the Minister for Defence, Paddy Donegan. After prisoners surrounded the eight prison officers in the yard, fights broke out as the officers realised an escape attempt was in progress. As other prisoners restrained the officers, Twomey, Mallon and O'Hagan boarded the helicopter. As the helicopter took off, in the confusion one officer shouted [...] "Close the gates, close <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> gates". The helicopter flew north and landed at a disused racecourse in the Baldoyle area of Dublin, where the escapees were met {{by members of the}} IRA's Dublin Brigade. The escapees were transferred to a taxi that had been hijacked earlier, and transported to safe houses.|$|E
50|$|The film {{is often}} named {{as the first}} {{mainstream}} film {{to use the word}} fuck in its dialogue. Another contender is Ulysses, which was released earlier the same year. The contention seems to have arisen because of a longtime absence of either film's release date in any easily obtainable sources, such as the Internet Movie Database. The BBFC certified the film in June 1967 (after demanding the removal, or at least obscuring, of <b>the</b> word <b>fucking),</b> whereas Ulysses, which suffered heavier cuts, had been certified three months earlier in March.|$|R

500|$|Schnauz's {{original}} story featured Doggett and Reyes {{investigating the}} case with a new agent. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Schnauz that the new FBI agent should be Leyla Harrison, played by Jolie Jenkins. Harrison had {{first appeared in the}} Spotnitz-penned eighth season episode [...] "Alone". Jenkins' character was created and named in memory of an Internet fan of The X-Files and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who had died of cancer on February 10, 2001. Jenkins' characterization, according to Spotnitz, brought out the [...] "Clint [...] " [...] in Robert Patrick's character John Doggett and her performance was called [...] "near perfection" [...] by Spotnitz during the audio commentary for [...] "Alone". Near the end of [...] "Scary Monsters", Leyla and Gabe Rotter were supposed to walk off-screen, holding hands, which prompted series director Kim Manners to sardonically ask [...] "when did this turn into <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> Brady Bunch?"

After the album was completed, the band said that these side projects [...] "saved the band" [...] and [...] "helped [...] break out of the box [...] were in". Coming back together and working out their differences hindered the writing process initially. During an interview in 2008, drummer Joey Jordison said [...] "we didn't talk to each other for three months, we just sat there wasting money in <b>the</b> <b>fucking</b> Houdini mansion."

500|$|Divine became {{increasingly}} known for outlandish stunts onstage, each {{time trying to}} outdo {{what he had done}} before.

[...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work clothes.

5000|$|Like many {{widely used}} {{offensive}} terms, motherfucker {{has a large}} list of minced oaths. Motherhumper, motherfugger, mother f'er, mothersucker, mothertrucker, motherlover, mofo, fothermucker, motherflower, motherkisser and many more are sometimes used in polite company or to avoid censorship. The participle motherfucking is often used as an emphatic, {{in the same way}} as <b>the</b> less strong <b>fucking.</b> <b>The</b> verb to motherfuck also exists, although it is less common. Conversely, when paired with an adjective, it can become a term denoting such things as originality and masculinity, as in the related phrase [...] "bad ass mother fucker".
