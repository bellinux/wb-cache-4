He said, [...] "If there is a 'Shaughnessy system' at Tulane, if it has any 'secret,' two words tell the whole story—common sense. All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> at Tulane is take the {{material}} I found and train it in plays built around the individual abilities of each man." ...|$|E

If I win, {{it will be because}} I {{have a little bit of}} luck and some of the others have trouble. I mean, Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like the back of his hand so there is no use trying to drive to beat him. You have to wait for him to have trouble. Then you are in with a chance." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women into the clerical work force. Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> something for {{the women who have}} always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living." ...|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain's {{fall from}} power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, [...] "Few men can have known such a {{reversal}} of fortune in so short a time." [...] He especially regretted the loss of Chequers as [...] "a place where I have been so happy", though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote [...] "I am content now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind." [...] As Lord President he assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as [...] "free {{from any of the}} rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike". As chairman of the Lord President's Committee, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. When Axis feelers for peace reached the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the Low Countries conquered and France tottering, Halifax urged following up and seeing if the actual offer was worthwhile. The battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet lasted three days, and Chamberlain's statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the feelers should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{works of}} Niccolò Machiavelli, such as The Prince, were {{considered}} a guideline for {{the behavior of}} a king in Frederick's age. In 1739, Frederick finished his Anti-Machiavel, an idealistic refutation of Machiavelli. It was written in French and published anonymously in 1740, but Voltaire distributed it in Amsterdam to great popularity. Frederick's years dedicated to the arts instead of politics ended upon the 1740 death of Frederick William and his inheritance of the Kingdom of Prussia. [...] Frederick and his father were more or less reconciled at the latter's death, and Frederick later admitted, despite their constant conflict, that Frederick William had been an effective ruler: [...] "What a terrible man he was. [...] But he was just, intelligent, and skilled in the management of affairs... it was through his efforts, through his tireless labor, that I have been able to accomplish everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> since." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1908 Homer {{suffered}} temporary {{impairment of}} his speech and muscular control as {{the effects of a}} mild stroke; on June 4 he wrote his brother Charles that [...] "I can paint as well as ever. I think my pictures better for having one eye in the pot and one eye up a chimney— a new departure in the art world." [...] By July 18 he was able to write that he had regained his abilities with the exception of tying [...] "my neck tie in the way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for the past 20 years....Every four or five days I try to do it but....it has been of no use." [...] Although he never completely recovered, Homer was well enough to attempt a major work, and it is probably Right and Left that he referred to {{in a letter to his}} brother Charles dated December 8, 1908: [...] "I am painting when it is light enough on a most surprising picture".|$|E

2500|$|The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation {{called upon}} Hilton to {{apologize}} for using an anti-gay slur against will.i.am during the incident, saying [...] "We have reached out to Hilton {{and asked him to}} apologize [...] [...] [...] and we would ask media outlets to avoid repetition of the slur in their coverage of this story." [...] Hilton initially refused to apologize, saying, [...] "I am saddened GLAAD chose to victimize me further by criticizing me for how I non-violently dealt with a very scary situation that, unfortunately, turned violent." [...] On June 25, 2009, however, Hilton did apologize, stating [...] "I am NOT apologizing to GLAAD...I am apologizing to the gay community, to anyone who was hurt by my choice of words, and to all the people who have ever emailed me to thank me for all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to fight for gay rights over the last few years." [...] In addition, he pledged to donate any money won in the lawsuit against Molina to the Matthew Shepard Foundation. In a statement released on its website, Judy Shepard, Chair of the MSF, declined the gift, saying that [...] "because the lawsuit presumably involves the physical attack prompted by Mr. Hilton's admitted use of an anti-gay slur, the Foundation will be unable to accept any funds obtained in such a manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was shot on 28 January 2010 by Kostas Kapetanidis, who Tamta had first collaborated with in 2005 for her debut video for [...] "Ftais", {{and has since}} {{directed}} her videos [...] "Den Teleionei Etsi I Agapi", [...] "Agapise Me", and [...] "Agapo", while he has also collaborated with Rouvas on multiple occasions since 1995, including on [...] "Ela Mou", [...] "Mia Fora", [...] "Shake It", both versions of [...] "S'eho Erotefthi", [...] "1000 Milia", [...] "Horis Kardia", and [...] "Irthes". The video was shot at Studio Rapti in Melissia from noon and did not conclude until the next morning. MAD TV crews were on set during shooting and did a photo report that same day. The concept of the video plays on a yin yang-type theme, with the light and darkness, innocence and eroticism continuously altering, thus contrasting with the song's title. Tamta's multiple wardrobe changes, varying between [...] "classy and trendy" [...] were meant {{as a means of}} further highlight these contradictions. MAD TV claimed that the shooting of the video was [...] "demanding". Tamta spoke about the emotions of the video and her image, saying: I feel absolutely sexy and for that are not responsible only the clothes. I feel sexy even without needing to wear something provocative. However, I am sure, as my collaborators are that this video clip will be the sexiest thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> up until now.|$|E
