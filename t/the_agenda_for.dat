5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space shuttle program, a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy.|$|E

The fleet expansion is not on <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> years to come. More recently, the air force decided to upgrade its fleet to the MS20 configuration.|$|E

5|$|With {{states from}} Africa and Asia joining the United Nations, {{development}} issues became increasingly important, {{resulting in the}} expansion of the United Nations in the development area, including the establishment of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1965 and negotiations on an International Economic Order (NIEO) as part of the North-South conflict in the 1970s. The 1980s were characterized by financial crisis and the retreat of the United States, which triggered a reform of the budgetary process and the downsizing of the Organization. With the end of the Cold War, the rediscovery of and renaissance of the United Nations were hailed; {{the first half of the}} 1990s saw a major expansion of the Organization and the reform associated with <b>the</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> Peace launched by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns is setting <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
