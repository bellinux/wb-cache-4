40|$|An {{adaptive}} slicing algorithm {{that can}} vary the layer thickness {{in relation to}} local geometry is presented. The algorithm is based on three fundamental concepts: (i) choice of criterion for accommodating complexities of surfaces, (ii) recognition of key characteristics and features of the object, and (iii) development of a grouping methodology for facets used to represent the object. Four criteria, cusp height, maximum deviation, chord length and volumetric error per unit length, are identified and the layer thickness is adjusted such {{that one of the}} four is met. Next, key characteristics of the object, such as horizontal and vertical surfaces, pointed edges and ends, are identified based on the local changes in surface complexity, and slice based feature recognition is introduced to identify the nature of a feature, protrusion or depression, by studying the slice data. Note that the present approach uses information only from the tessellated model, and thus is different from current implementations. Finally, the concept of grouping of the facets based on their vertex coordinates is developed to minimize the number of searches for possible intersection of the facets with a slice plane. The slicing algorithm is interfaced with adaptive laminated machining and the stereolithography process through a CNC post processor and a hatching algorithm respectively. A comparison of the estimated surface quality and build time indicates that adaptive slicing produces superior parts in a shorter build time.

The issue of constitutional referenda touches on the very foundations of the constitutional system of a country. It inquires into the nature of the power to make and to amend a constitution, and into how to understand this power and the procedures involved. In particular, it raises fundamental questions regarding the democratic nature of constitutional politics as well as the nature of democracy at the basis of a constitution. This contribution on the Constitution of the Netherlands could have been very short indeed, much shorter than it is.

This report documents and examines the history of archaeological management at Minute Man National Historical Park from 1959 to the present. It presents a description of the over 156 archaeological projects that have taken place within Park during that time. It also presents an analysis of that work from the perspective of examining how the National Park Service managed archaeological resources in the Park. 	This research found that management of archaeological resources in the Park has been dictated by a number of things: the expansion and increasing sophistication of cultural resource management, the evolution of archaeological theory and methods, and the Park's own management plan and development strategy. The research found that the past forty years have seen profound changes in the way the Park perceived archaeology. It has evolved from regarding archaeology merely a means to fill in gaps in the historical record to a view of the archaeological resource as something considerable more complex. 	The conclusion of the report is that until recent years, archaeological management at Minute Man has lagged at least a decade behind the highest standards of the preservation community and the standards of archaeological method and theory. In the past fifteen years, however, the Park has aggressively pursued archaeological investigations as a means of dealing with the expanding resource base, enriching its interpretation, and increasing public awareness of the richness and variety of its resources...|$|R
