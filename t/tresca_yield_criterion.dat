On the contrary the yield loci which result from the tension-torsion loading fulfil the <b>Tresca</b> <b>yield</b> <b>criterion</b> for both the quasistatic and the dynamic tests.

The yield loci of the quasistatic (10 high minus 3 s high minus 1) and dynamic (10 high 2 s high minus 1) combined tension torsion-tests of austenitic steel are described by ellipses which correspond to different proof strain definitions of yielding. For low (plastic) strains and strain rates the yield loci are in close agreement with the von Mises yield criterion whereas for large strains or high strain rates the yield loci tend towards the <b>Tresca</b> <b>yield</b> <b>criterion.</b> Therefore the size and the shape of the yield loci are functions of strain and strain rate. The quasistatic and dynamic tension-torsion behaviour of the austenitic steel is described by Perzyna's constitutive equation.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 154 - 164. A {{constitutive}} {{theory of}} finite strain plasticity is developed {{by using the}} methods of convex analysis. The theory abstracts and extends the classical assumptions of a convex region of admissible stresses, and the normality law. The overall effects of plastic behaviour are contained in the theory through the presence {{of one or more}} internal variables. The thermodynamic restrictions of the second law together with the use of results of convex analysis lead in a natural way to the evolution equation or flow law. Non-smooth yield surfaces are included in the theory; nevertheless, the form of this theory makes a study of propagation of singular surfaces awkward. With a view to carrying out such a study, an alternative means of treating non-smooth convex yield surfaces is developed. This alternative theory is essentially a synthesis of the theory of Sewell, and that presented earlier in the thesis. The theory of singular surfaces is reviewed in the context of finite strain elastoplasticity, and necessary conditions for the propagation of acceleration waves are derived. A comparison of elastic and plastic wave speeds is made, and inequalities similar to those of Mandel for the small-strain case are derived. The propagation conditions for principal waves in both longitudinal and transverse directions, and the corresponding wave speeds, are found and compared for solids obeying a neo-Hookean elastic law, and with either the von Mises or <b>Tresca</b> <b>yield</b> <b>criteria...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the wide}} range of {{properties}} of a photodegradable polymer are exploited to generate a host of different inhomogeneous arrangements that can help us experimentally study crack path selection problems. The model material which we are using is a polyethylene co-polymer, ECO, whose photosensitive behavior allows alterations in its mechanical properties when subjected to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. It is seen that ECO becomes stiffer but more brittle upon UV irradiation. Material degradation in such polymers enables their use as an environmentally friendly material that can be broken into smaller nontoxic parts under small forces such as wind and light. This model material is then used to generate microstructures that possess either discrete or distributed local inhomogeneities similar to granular materials, i. e.,metals. The first part of this literature describes the experimental work done on the three microstructures developed. The microstructures all exhibited the same grain properties but possessed varying grain boundary properties. Each microstructure was loaded in a single edge notch tension (SENT) configuration, and the resulting strain fields were recorded using digital image correlation (DIC). Depending on the applied load and the local microstructure, different crack paths occur, such as the main crack simply extending, or a main crack arresting and a host of secondary cracks appearing at critical locations. Additionally, different types of failure occur within the granular inhomogeneous model displaying intergranular and/or transgranular failure for specific hours of UV irradiation. The DIC results, correlated with global load-displacement measurements, shed light on the conditions under which local crack nucleation and growth can occur. In the second part of this work, the global load-displacement results are compared with a finite element model using ABAQUS. Two different models, interface and interphase, are created to assist in validating the experimental results. Through comparison of the global load-displacement results with the experimental and numerical study, the different developed models can be seen to represent a particular microstructure. A failure criteria is also considered using numerical analysis by analyzing areas of high stress levels using the von Mises and <b>Tresca</b> <b>yield</b> <b>criteria.</b> These criteria illustrate areas in which high magnitudes of stress occur and these results are compared with the experimental failure initiation sites...|$|R
