60|$|It was now {{too late}} to think of going to Fairview, for <b>the</b> last <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> <b>departed.</b> And as it was, Mrs. Carson insisted upon it that the boys remain all night.|$|R
50|$|At one stop, Alyosha {{gets out}} to fetch some water, but <b>the</b> <b>train</b> leaves without him. Frantic, {{he gets a}} lift to the next station from an old woman truck driver. He is too late; <b>the</b> <b>train</b> has <b>already</b> <b>departed.</b> However, Shura got off and is waiting for him. The couple then go to see Pavlov's wife. They {{discover}} that she is living with another man and leave. Alyosha returns, takes back the soap he had given her, and gives it instead to Pavlov's invalid father.|$|R
50|$|The {{dispatcher}} at Dahlerau {{tried to}} hold back <b>the</b> departing <b>train</b> by running alongside it and giving emergency signals, but failed to get the driver's attention. He then immediately telephoned the dispatcher in Wuppertal-Beyenburg to try and stop <b>the</b> passenger <b>train.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> <b>departed</b> from Beyenburg, {{and there was no}} way for the dispatcher to reach either <b>the</b> freight <b>train</b> or <b>the</b> railbus by radio, as <b>the</b> station and <b>trains</b> did not have the necessary equipment. The dispatcher, faced with the now inevitable crash, phoned emergency services, informing them of the accident about to happen. Ambulances, firefighters and police were promptly ordered from Radevormwald, Wuppertal and Solingen. The rescue effort was hindered by the inaccessibility of the accident site on a hillside and by parents who had waited for <b>the</b> <b>train</b> at Radevormwald station and had now come to search for their children, as well as onlookers who were attracted by the rescue effort. Because of the quick rescue and medical treatment, 25 people survived despite severe injuries. 41 pupils, two teachers, a mother and two railway staff died. A single pupil was the only person not injured at all.|$|R
5000|$|Lewis {{assumed that}} because the express had {{apparently}} not reached Newtown, <b>the</b> two <b>trains</b> would cross at Newtown rather than Abermule, {{and he did not}} look at the tablet closely enough to see that it was the one for the Newtown-Abermule section that had just been handed over by the driver of <b>the</b> stopping <b>train.</b> He crossed back to the down platform and, because the driver was oiling around the engine, handed the tablet back to the stopping train's fireman, who did not notice the error either. Lewis gave the [...] "Right away" [...] signal by hand. Jones, who was also on the down platform, assumed that the express had been delayed or held at Newtown for some reason. Rogers, who was still at the ground frame, assumed the same, because of Lewis's actions and because the frame was locked, and so he lowered the down advance starting signal. Lewis, Jones and Rogers did not realise the truth until <b>the</b> stopping <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> <b>departed.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 8 January 1967, {{the popular}} Polish actor Zbigniew Cybulski died on {{platform}} 3. Cybulski {{was trying to}} jump into a <b>train</b> that was <b>already</b> <b>departing,</b> but fell instead under its wheels. On the 30th anniversary of this event, Andrzej Wajda unveiled a plaque on the platform in memory of Cybulski.|$|R
60|$|In {{two hours}} more they had {{overtaken}} <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> <b>already</b> on <b>the</b> march, {{and were in}} the midst of the group of outriders. Judge Peyton's face, albeit a trifle perplexed, turned towards Clarence with a kindly, half-tolerant look of welcome. The boy's heart instantly melted with forgiveness.|$|R
5000|$|Major {{works to}} {{increase}} the commercial speed of <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>already</b> started in 1967: the Rome-Florence [...] "super-direct" [...] line was built for trains up to 230 km/h, and reduced the journey time to less than two hours. This has been <b>the</b> first high-speed <b>train</b> line ever built in Europe, as its operations started in 1977.|$|R
50|$|In 1858 a {{coupling}} broke on an excursion <b>train</b> at <b>the</b> {{station and the}} rear portion rolled back down the gradient from Round Oak railway station towards Brettell Lane where it collided with another train (which was actually {{part of the same}} excursion, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>already</b> having been safely divided once due to its extreme length!) 14 passengers were killed and 50 more injured.|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} of department head is incredibly important to any university. Because many new department heads are {{faculty members who}} have little to no leadership or management experience, some orientation training is warranted. This paper investigates the topics that should be covered in such <b>training.</b> <b>The</b> results {{are based on a}} survey of existing civil engineering department heads and an examination of <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>already</b> available through universities and professional societies...|$|R
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>train</b> was <b>already</b> moving. I {{tried to}} catch her, but failed; and a minute later the cars rolled out of sight.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 NMBS/SNCB ordered 95 Desiro ML trains, with {{options for}} up to 300. In 2013, the order of <b>the</b> final 250 <b>trains</b> was {{suspended}} because of technical problems with <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>already</b> running. <b>The</b> company is seeking damages from Siemens for these problems which caused many delays. Siemens had already been fined €25 million for the late delivery of the first batch of <b>trains.</b> <b>The</b> order for all units was confirmed in 2013 and in March 2015 the last two arrived.|$|R
50|$|The {{new service}} began running on March 3, 1981. Initial {{patronage}} was good, with <b>the</b> first <b>trains</b> standing-room only, but by summer ridership had dwindled. The second inbound trip from Pitcairn, which carried at times {{as few as}} five passengers, was dropped. To compensate Amtrak began stopping the Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh - Altoona) at Pitcairn (<b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>already</b> stopped at Greensburg). Service at Manor in was discontinued in favor of Irwin, 2.4 mi closer to Pittsburgh. In addition, a move to mainline trackage in Westmoreland County shaved 12 minutes off the schedule.|$|R
60|$|Dominey bowed stiffly {{and took}} his place with <b>the</b> others. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> started. Dominey gazed thoughtfully out of the window. Seaman, who was waiting about for his audience, {{patted him on the}} arm.|$|R
50|$|Services are {{operated}} by 6-car 800 Series sets, {{with a maximum}} speed of 260 km/h. <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> were developed by Hitachi, and based on <b>the</b> 700 series <b>trains</b> <b>already</b> in service on the Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen line.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} located at <b>the</b> <b>train</b> track from Zwolle to Emmen. This track was opened in 1905 and was {{constructed}} by the NOLS. Before <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> Nieuw-Amsterdam <b>already</b> had two steam tram connections: the DSM station was opened in 1899 and the EDS station in 1903.|$|R
60|$|Sherman reached Bridgeport about noon of the 17th {{and found}} Blair with <b>the</b> pontoon <b>train</b> <b>already</b> there. A {{few of the}} enemy were intrenched on the west bank, but they made little {{resistance}} and soon surrendered. Two divisions were crossed that night and the third the following morning.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> are <b>already</b> in {{successful}} {{widespread use}} in other cities, including 30 units on trams in Belgrade and 40 are also {{planned for the}} Cuiabá system in Brazil. Malaga's metro however, represents the largest single order of the model.|$|R
60|$|Bosinney, {{who wore}} a slouch hat, {{stopped in front of}} him, spun around, and rushed back towards the {{carriage}} he had just left. He was too late. A porter caught him by <b>the</b> coat; <b>the</b> <b>train</b> was <b>already</b> moving on.|$|R
30|$|In a first {{simulation}} experiment of this sixth {{group of}} experiments (Table  1), only one sentence was uttered by the male speaker for each frequent syllable. This syllable was {{extracted from the}} acoustic signal, and the appropriate auditory state was generated and imitated by the model. Thus, just one realization was trained per syllable, but <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>already</b> took into account the differences in frequency of occurrence for the 200 most frequent syllables (for details, see [22]). In the present paper, we report on a further simulation of imitating of these 200 most frequent syllables by using a refined training data set comprising more than one realization per syllable (see Results section).|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> {{begun to}} move as Holmes spoke. Glancing back, I saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and waving his hand as if he desired to have <b>the</b> <b>train</b> stopped. It was too late, however, for we were rapidly {{gathering}} momentum, and an instant later had shot clear of the station.|$|R
50|$|In Belgium the TBL 1 {{crocodiles}} were complemented with Eurobalises in the TBL 1+ operation scheme. The TBL 1+ definition {{allowed for}} an additional speed restriction to be transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> computer <b>already.</b> Likewise in Luxembourg the Memor II (using crocodiles) was extended into a Memor II+ operation scheme.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{delays in}} planning, {{infrastructure}} measures {{could not be}} completed {{in time for the}} timetable change in December 2015. Therefore, a transition timetable was implemented, which provides for a break in operations for most trains in Westerburg. In the northern part, which is the responsibility of SPNV Nord and NWL, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>already</b> ran hourly to Siegen, as provided for in the new timetable concept. In the southern part, which is mostly in the area of responsibility of the RMV, the old timetable still operates, which provides only a two-hourly regular-interval services with some additional services. The breaks that occur in Westerburg often cause waits of 24-39 minutes for <b>the</b> other <b>train,</b> which are very unattractive for passengers. The complete introduction of the new timetable is not expected before December 2017.|$|R
6000|$|She turned away, {{and walked}} {{a little way}} down <b>the</b> platform. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> was <b>already</b> in <b>the</b> station. She entered a {{carriage}} {{and sat in the}} furthest corner. [...] "Thank you," [...] she said. [...] "I am glad that you have told me the truth. Would you mind going away now, please?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> {{stopped at}} one large junction. Looking {{out through the}} window she saw by the lamps that it was Guildford. After another interminable {{interval}} of clattering and tossing and plunging through the darkness, {{they came to a}} second station of importance, Petersfield. [...] "We are nearing our destination," [...] Girdlestone remarked, shutting up his book.|$|R
500|$|The MTA {{also agreed}} to extend the G to Forest Hills–71st Avenue during evenings and {{weekends}} (when the V was not running), and run more trains on that route. There was a four-hour period where the G, , and V, {{as well as the}} Queens Boulevard line's express services, the E and the F, were all supposedly running at once since the V stopped running at midnight and the G was extended to 71st Avenue at 8:00p.m. The authority [...] "had spent several hundred thousand dollars on tests, trying {{to figure out a way}} to keep <b>the</b> G <b>train</b> running past Court Square and farther into Queens on weekdays, but because of the addition of <b>the</b> V <b>train,</b> which shared space along the Queens Boulevard Line with <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>already</b> there (<b>the</b> E, F and R trains), G trains could not fit during the daytime, when service is heaviest." ...|$|R
50|$|That same day, Steve {{takes the}} boy to the UNRRA camp before leaving for America. He hopes to send for the boy once the {{paperwork}} is completed. Mrs. Murray remembers the boy. Suspecting that Jim is Karel, she hurries to <b>the</b> <b>train</b> station to bring Mrs. Malik back, but <b>the</b> <b>train</b> has <b>already</b> left. Then, she sees Mrs. Malik on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> platform; she had changed her mind and decided to stay.|$|R
50|$|Sets H10 and H13 were {{transferred}} from Sendai to Akita in March 2017, entering revenue service on Akita area services on 28 July 2017. These sets were reliveried {{with a pink}} bodyline stripe to match <b>the</b> 701 series <b>trains</b> <b>already</b> used in <b>the</b> area.|$|R
50|$|Off the field, Parkinson was a {{railways}} worker, initially at Bendigo {{railway station}} before {{he moved to}} Melbourne. On 21 October 1913, Parkinson was alighting from a train at South Yarra station, {{on his way home}} from work, when his leg slipped in between <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and platform. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> was <b>already</b> in motion and Parkinson received severe leg injuries. He died from shock the following day, at The Alfred Hospital.|$|R
50|$|Passenger traffic {{ended in}} 1992. The {{connection}} to <b>the</b> Finnish <b>trains</b> was <b>already</b> broken in 1988 when <b>the</b> Haparanda-Tornio-Kemi <b>trains</b> were discontinued. There {{was a test}} with tourist traffic between Boden-Haparanda in the summer 2000, {{but it has not}} been repeated since.|$|R

50|$|The daily working {{timetable}} (DWTT) {{consists of the}} standard {{working timetable}} (SWTT) as amended by publications such as Special Train Notices or telegrams. Special train notices are temporary amendments to the SWTT, issued as required for additional ('special') trains or alterations to <b>the</b> working of <b>trains</b> <b>already</b> in <b>the</b> SWTT.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver of}} <b>the</b> Connex <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> passed a {{signal at danger}} without {{authority}} on a previous occasion, and was still under special supervision because of this. Following the accident, he was permanently removed from driving duties.|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{maintenance}} vehicles have also derailed. [...] On February 19, 2009, a vacuum maintenance vehicle derailed on the K Route near the Court House station, and derailed again {{the same day}} when it was being taken to a rail yard. [...] The same day, a Yellow Line train with 5000-Series cars derailed near Mount Vernon Square, but with no serious injuries, as <b>the</b> <b>train</b> had <b>already</b> offloaded passengers.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{days later}} when a {{representative}} of the Afghan Government called Mohabbat and surrendered to the U.S., Mohabbat immediately called U.S. authorities and explained that the Taliban had capitulated to all U.S. demands. The response from U.S. authorities: [...] "I will convey your message, but I am afraid that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> has <b>already</b> left <b>the</b> station." [...] To Mohabbat's sorrow, within days Afghanistan was bombed and the war began.|$|R
