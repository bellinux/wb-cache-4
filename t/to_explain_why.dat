5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the German people {{themselves}} had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why {{it was necessary for}} outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.|$|E
5|$|At the {{survivors}}' camp, Jim (Andrew Rothenberg) begins digging holes, refusing <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why.</b> As {{the survivors}} press him, he lashes back at them, forcing Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) to restrain Jim. Jim breaks down, explaining how {{he lost his}} family to walkers, and that a dream inspired him to dig the holes. Jim warns Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) to keep her son Carl (Chandler Riggs) safe.|$|E

5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would have been unable to field their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Mohammad Alavi {{was heavily}} involved in the level's development. Alavi sought <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Russia would invade the United States, and have the player make an emotional connection with Makarov. Much of the level's development was spent designing the massacre portion, as Alavi did not want it to feel too contrived or traumatic. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward and publisher Activision were both supportive of the level's inclusion, though several game testers expressed disapproval, with one game tester refusing to play the level at all.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the oscillation dies away, {{that it is the}} resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued in until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E

5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central {{idea is to}} reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E
5|$|These {{measures}} eventually proved {{insufficient to}} avoid deflation. Having taken over in August 2013, Governor Mark Carney wrote his first open letter in February 2015 <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> inflation had fallen below 1% {{for the first}} time in the MPC's history. This was followed by deflation of 0.1% in April 2015, the first month of negative CPI growth since the 1960s, and triggering a second letter. As of February 2015, Carney has written five such letters. Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, the MPC cut the base rate from 0.5% to 0.25%, the first change since March 2009. At the same time, it announced a further round of quantitative easing, valued at £60 billion, bringing the total to £435 billion.|$|E
5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> people would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E

Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.|$|E

Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. <b>To</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
