This successor company {{remains one of}} the few manufacturers of tungsten carbide-studded snow <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> <b>bicycles.</b> Suomen Rengastehdas continues to produce bicycle tyres, including all Nokian-branded bicycle tyres.|$|E
50|$|By 1890 the {{business}} had transferred to premises in Melksham in Wiltshire. Products {{at this time}} included solid tyres, conveyor belts and components for railways. By 1900 pneumatic <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> <b>bicycles</b> were being produced, and by 1906 the first car tyres were advertised. In 1915 the company acquired Greenland Mill in Bradford on Avon (Wiltshire). In 1933 the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.|$|E
50|$|John Boyd Dunlop {{was born}} at a Dreghorn farm on 5 February 1840. He {{qualified}} as a veterinary surgeon at the Dick Vet in Edinburgh and set up practice in Belfast, where he invented a pneumatic <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> <b>bicycles</b> in October 1887. The principle had been patented by Robert William Thomson in 1847, but it was Dunlop's invention that made a success of the idea.|$|E
50|$|Edouard seemed {{destined for}} a career as an artist, but around 1888 {{he and his brother}} Andre {{returned}} to Clermont-Ferrand {{in order to try to}} save the failing family business, then a manufacturer of agricultural tools, drive belts and hoses. In 1889, he improved greatly on the design of the pneumatic <b>tyre</b> <b>for</b> <b>bicycles,</b> making <b>tyres</b> easier to change and repair. The invention proved its worth in the Paris-Brest cycle event organized by the newspaper Le Petit Journal in September 1891, and Michelin quickly adapted his inflatable <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> use on motor vehicles, of which France was becoming the world's leading producer. Success came rapidly, and already in 1896 approximately 300 Paris taxis were running on Michelin pneumatic tyres. His company went on to experience tremendous growth serving the fledgling industry around the turn of the century and beyond.|$|R
50|$|The Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd {{was set up}} in Birmingham in 1901 to {{manufacture}} Dunlop <b>tyres,</b> initially <b>for</b> <b>bicycles</b> and later <b>for</b> motor vehicles. The First World War initiated a huge expansion in the demand <b>for</b> solid <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> lorries, and the Fort Dunlop factory was built in 1916 on a 120-hectare site {{on the east side of}} Birmingham. Post-war, the motor industry grew and Dunlop was well placed to supply the demand <b>for</b> <b>tyres.</b> In the 1970s it was still the largest tyre factory outside the United States, however, the increased number of foreign cars imported into Britain led to a decline in demand, the company was sold in the 1980s and large-scale tyre production ceased at Fort Dunlop.Dunlop Tyres continued to produce specialised vintage, motorcycle and motorsport tyres on the site. The factory was to close in September 2014, with production moving to Germany and France.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1887, John Boyd Dunlop {{developed}} the first practical pneumatic or inflatable <b>tyre</b> <b>for</b> his son's tricycle and, using his {{knowledge and experience}} with rubber, in the yard of his home in Belfast fitted it to a wooden disc 96 centimetres across. The tyre was an inflated tube of sheet rubber. He then took his wheel and a metal wheel from his son's tricycle and rolled both across the yard together. The metal wheel stopped rolling but the pneumatic continued until it hit a gatepost and rebounded. Dunlop then put pneumatics on both rear wheels of the tricycle. That too rolled better, and Dunlop moved on to larger <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> a <b>bicycle</b> [...] "with even more startling results." [...] He tested that in Cherryvale sports ground, South Belfast, and a patent was granted on 7 December 1888. Unknown to Dunlop another Scot, Robert William Thomson from Stonehaven, had patented a pneumatic tyre in 1847.|$|R
50|$|The Church of Scotland Dreghorn and Springside Parish Church at {{the centre}} of the village dates from 1780. Its {{octagonal}} plan which is unusual in Scotland was produced by the church's principal benefactor, Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton. The village's most famous inhabitant, John Boyd Dunlop, was born at a Dreghorn farm in 1840, and in 1887 when practicing as a veterinary surgeon in Belfast he invented pneumatic <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> <b>bicycles.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1898 Oscar Englebert, who {{till then}} {{had worked with}} {{rubberised}} coatings and mats, set up a tyre factory in Belgium, manufacturing pneumatic <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> <b>bicycles</b> and automobiles, and by 1912 the business employed 400 people. By 1926 the workforce had grown to 3,500 {{and was one of}} Europe's top five rubber manufacturing businesses. In 1929, Englebert set up a second tyre plant just across the border at Aachen in Germany. In 1931 the Société du Pneu Englebert (Englebert Tyre Company) was born. The company acquired a French tyre factory in Clairoix in 1936; it was here, in 1937, that Englebert produced their millionth tyre.|$|E
50|$|Two {{years after}} he was granted the patent, Dunlop was officially {{informed}} that it was invalid as Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson (1822-1873), had patented the idea in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847. see Tyres. To capitalise on pneumatic <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> <b>bicycles,</b> Dunlop and Du Cros resuscitated a Dublin-listed company and renamed it Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency. Dunlop retired in 1895. In 1896 Du Cros sold their whole bicycle tyre business to British financier Terah Hooley for £3 million. Hooley arranged some new window-dressing, titled board members, etc., and re-sold the company {{to the public for}} £5 million. Du Cros remained head of the business until his death. Early in the 20th century it was renamed Dunlop Rubber.|$|E

50|$|The season {{marked the}} start of a new era in the premier class with the arrival of 990cc {{four-stroke}} bikes. Four factory teams, Repsol Honda, Marlboro Yamaha, Suzuki and Aprilia, raced with the new four-stroke bikes while all the satellite teams raced with the 500cc two-stroke bike. The season also marked the return of Dunlop and the entry of Bridgestone to the premier class. Dunlop supplied the <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> Suzuki, Aprilia, Yamaha WCM and Pramac Honda, Bridgestone supplied the <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> Team Roberts and Kanemoto Racing, and Michelin supplied the <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> the remaining six teams.
