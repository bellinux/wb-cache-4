5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, <b>thin</b> <b>lips</b> and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
25|$|During the Ava period, {{from the}} 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) {{style of the}} Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large {{protruding}} ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, <b>thin</b> <b>lips</b> and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa mudra.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with HGPS {{typically}} appear normal at birth, {{but their}} growth is severely retarded, resulting in short stature, {{a very low}} body weight and delayed tooth eruption. Their facial/cranial proportions and facial features are abnormal, characterized by larger-than-normal eyes, a thin, beaked nose, <b>thin</b> <b>lips,</b> small chin and jaw (micrognathia), protruding ears, scalp hair, eyebrows, and lashes, hair loss, large head, large fontanelle and generally appearing aged. Other features include skeletal alterations (osteolysis, osteoporosis), amyotrophy (wasting of muscle), lipodystrophy and skin atrophy (loss of subcutaneous tissue and fat) with sclerodermatous focal lesions, severe atherosclerosis and prominent scalp veins. However, the level of cognitive function, motor skills, and risk of developing cancer is not affected significantly.|$|E

25|$|At Susa {{a marble}} woman's head was found (Tehran, Iranian National Museum, Inv. No. 2452), {{which is one}} of the most famous works of art from the Parthian era. The head is {{proportionally}} slightly larger than real life. The face is broad with a long thin nose. The eyeballs are not modeled, but the pupil is indicated by a dot. The mouth is softly modeled with rather <b>thin</b> <b>lips.</b> The woman wears a heavy crown, on which the inscription: made by Antiochus, son of Dryas. On the back, a veil is seen. The back of the statue as a whole worked summarily, indicating that the head was designed for the frontal view. She surely was once embedded in a separately crafted body. The high quality of the work sparked an extensive debate in the research of Parthian art. The modeling of the face is reminiscent of Hellenistic art. Also, the headgear is similar to Hellenistic styles, but other details are clearly Iranian. Accordingly, it has been suggested that this is a work from the Greco-Roman world, which was reworked locally.|$|E

[...] "Six-foot-one, with hawklike features, he presented a formidable appearance," [...] said Sam Moskowitz.

500|$|Adult {{black dogfish}} {{typically}} measure [...] {{in length and}} can reach , making it the largest member of its family. Females attain a larger ultimate size than males. The shark has a rather stocky and laterally compressed body, with a moderately long, thick, and flattened snout that forms a very broad arch at the front. The sizable, horizontally oval eyes are a reflective green in life and lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids); they are followed a short distance behind by much smaller spiracles (accessory respiratory openings). The nostrils are anteriorly placed and preceded by short flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and evenly arched, with <b>thin</b> <b>lips</b> and short but deep furrows around the corners. There are around 34 tooth rows in either side of both jaws; each tooth has three (occasionally up to five) slender cusps, with the central one the longest.|$|E

500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the <b>thin</b> <b>lips.</b> The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E
500|$|With a total adult {{length of}} {{anywhere}} from , the smooth toadfish has an elongate {{body with a}} rounded back and flattened belly. The body narrows posteriorly to the slender tail, and its fins are all elongate and rounded. The dorsal fin has 9 to 11rays. The pectoral fin has 15 to 18rays, {{the first of which}} is very short. It arises well below the level of the eye. The anal fin has 7â€“9rays and caudal fin has 11. The smooth toadfish has a small mouth with <b>thin</b> <b>lips</b> at its apex and a tiny chin. The round eyes are [...] (unable to rotate), their upper border is level with the profile of the back and the lower border is well above the mouth. In a slightly depressed area {{just in front of the}} eyes are two small nipple-shaped structures (papillae) that are the nasal organs. The openings face to the rear of the fish and are closed by flaps attached to the walls closest to the fish's midline. The first pharyngobranchial gill arch is elongated and narrow with many tiny teeth. The smooth toadfish has tiny spines that are entirely within the skin layer; these run along its back from the nasal organs almost to the dorsal fin, and along its sides from the eye to the pectoral fine, and along its underparts from behind its mouth to its vent. The skin is smooth even when the fish is fully inflated. It swallows water or air via a flap in its throat to swell itself up.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ashley Montagu, [...] "among {{both the}} Northern and Eastern Hamites {{are to be}} found some of the most {{beautiful}} types of humanity". Typical Hamitic physical traits included narrow facial features; an orthognathous visage; light brown to dark brown skin tone; wavy, curly or straight hair; thick to <b>thin</b> <b>lips</b> without eversion; and a dolichocephalic to mesocephalic cranial index. These somatic attributes varied depending on the environment and through contact with non-Hamitic stocks. Among the Western Hamites, Semitic and Negroid influences could be found in urban areas, with a Nordic strain present in the northwestern mountains. Similar non-Hamitic elements also existed among the Eastern Hamites, but with a more marked Negroid influence in areas bordering the Upper Nile and Great Lakes and a pronounced Armenoid strain in the Eastern Desert.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} this species is an unusual shape for a helicid, elongatedly conical, 10 to 20 mm high, with a width of only 4 to 7 mm. The spire tapers regularly, but ends in a blunt tip. The oval {{aperture}} has a <b>thin</b> <b>lip,</b> and the narrow umbilicus is almost covered.|$|R
60|$|A sharp, unlovely face it was: though, {{like many}} a great churchman's face of those days, it was neither thin nor haggard; but rather round, sleek, of a puffy and unwholesome paleness.
