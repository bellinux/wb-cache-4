5|$|Although {{there were}} Spanish missions, pueblos (towns), presidios (forts), and ranchos {{along the coast}} of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada. The first European Americans to visit the {{mountains}} were amongst a group led by fur <b>trapper</b> Jedediah Smith, crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827, at Ebbetts Pass.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after Nelson's death, the state traded land for Nelson's estate, which became part of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The site {{is now known as}} the <b>Trapper</b> Nelson Zoo Historic District. After the land was {{converted}} to a park, but still unopen to the public, the camp was often vandalized. One of Nelson's tool sheds was burned down; the arsonist attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|Alberta's most {{prominent}} baseball rivalry {{existed between the}} Calgary Cannons and Edmonton <b>Trappers</b> of the Pacific Coast League. The Cannons existed from 1985 to 2002 while the <b>Trappers</b> existed from 1980 to 2004. The rivalry never reached {{the same level as}} it did in other sports, however, and ultimately both teams relocated to the United States (the <b>Trappers</b> to Round Rock, Texas, and the Cannons to Albuquerque, New Mexico). The <b>Trappers</b> captured four PCL championships during their existence, while the Cannons won none.|$|R
5|$|Glass {{is badly}} mauled by {{a grizzly bear}} and left close to death. <b>Trapper</b> John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the {{abandoned}} pelts.|$|E
5|$|The Historic period {{begins in}} the late 18th century with the {{exploration}} of southern Utah by Padres Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near {{what is now the}} Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area. In 1825, <b>trapper</b> and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.|$|E
5|$|The zoo was {{eventually}} {{shut down by}} state health inspectors in 1960. After his zoo was closed, Nelson became a hermit and suffered from undiagnosed health problems. In 1968, he was found dead from a gunshot wound in his cabin by a friend. His death was ruled a suicide. Nelson's campsite {{is now known as}} the <b>Trapper</b> Nelson Zoo Historic District in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, Hobe Sound, Florida.|$|E

5|$|Towns {{around the}} forest, {{including}} Stanley, Ketchum, and Sawtooth City, were founded as mining {{towns in the}} latter part of the 19thcentury by prospectors and trappers, including Civil War veteran Captain John Stanley, after whom the town of Stanley is named. Ketchum is named after the <b>trapper</b> and guide David Ketchum, while the Sublett Mountains are named after <b>trapper</b> William Sublette, who lived in the area in the 1830s. Most of the logging in the region was for firewood and timber for miners and homesteaders. For much of the 20thcentury, sheep and cattle grazing were the primary large-scale land uses of the forest. Sheep drives were common in the Wood River Valley after the mining boom and shepherds from southern Idaho drove their flocks north to graze the upper elevation areas in Sawtooth National Forest. The original sheepherders were Basque Americans, while today many of the sheepherders are Peruvians contracted through the Department of Labor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trapper</b> Nelson {{was born}} Vincent Nostokovich (or Natulkiewicz) to Polish {{immigrant}} parents in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1908 or 1909. As a boy, {{to earn money}} he began trapping animals such as muskrats in the marshes of New Jersey. His parents did not speak English, so Nelson would often assist them in translating {{to make sure they}} were not taken advantage of. However, when his mother died and his father remarried, Nelson ran away from home, heading west.|$|E
5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born <b>trapper</b> and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E
50|$|The {{committee}} is mandated to inform Canada’s Aboriginal <b>trappers</b> of important {{developments in the}} fur sector, particularly relating to international humane trapping standards and results of the trap research and testing program. The committee also facilitates communications and promotes joint programs between Aboriginal <b>trappers</b> and provincial and territorial wildlife agencies. Aboriginal organizations, governments and industry are kept informed of issues of concern to Aboriginal communities, <b>trappers</b> and the fur trade.|$|R

5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur <b>trapper</b> that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, a new route named Seminoe cutoff was {{established}} {{on the southern}} side of the river. It was named after <b>trapper</b> Basil LaJeunesse who {{was referred to as}} Seminoe by the Shoshone Indians. The Seminoe cutoff split from the main trail at the 6th crossing and rejoined it at Burnt Ranch, bypassing both Rocky Ridge and four of the river crossings, which was an advantage in the early spring and summer during high runoff. The route was used extensively in the 1850s, especially by the Mormon companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a <b>trapper</b> whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes. Every class now {{possesses}} the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the <b>Trapper</b> class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's cooldown time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and they no longer have to rely on the Medic class.|$|E
5|$|Things did {{not stay}} {{peaceful}} for long. On December 17, 1931, Charles Nelson shot partner John Dykas in the back, killing him. <b>Trapper</b> Nelson, angered by his step-brother's actions, testified against {{him at the}} trial for Dykas' murder. Charles was given a 20-year sentence at Raiford Prison. Disillusioned with civilization, Nelson withdrew from the beach, settling deep in the woods on the Loxahatchee River that same December. Using what little money he had and money borrowed from his sister, he bought 800acres.|$|E
5|$|Trapper: The Trapper-class {{characters}} can {{use their}} gear to track the Monster's movements. As the Monster occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the <b>trapper</b> can use these 'signs' to find {{the location of the}} monster. Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow the movements of the Monster. Following the release of the Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained the ability to use the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to the monster's smell.|$|E
50|$|European fur traders {{relied on}} the {{knowledge}} of the land possessed by the <b>trappers</b> and the Innu to provide them with furs. <b>Trappers</b> living in and around North West River would come to the trading post to exchange furs for flour, raisins, canvas tents, axes, guns and other goods Valuable furs from beavers, mink, martins, seals, foxes, bears and many other fur baring animals. <b>Trappers</b> maintained traplines inherited from relatives throughout central Labrador.|$|R

50|$|The Whiteshell <b>Trappers</b> Museum {{is located}} {{on the grounds of the}} Alf Hole Goose Sanctuary. Built in 1997, the museum is modeled after a fur <b>trapper's</b> cabin. Interpreters discuss the history of fur {{trapping}}, trapping techniques, and local wildlife.|$|R
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older <b>trapper</b> cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} <b>Trapper</b> Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
