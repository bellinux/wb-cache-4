5|$|After Robert Baker's {{death in}} 1623 {{and the death}} of his eldest son Samuel shortly after, his widow and her father {{purchased}} the wardship of their surviving children; the death of the next eldest son, Robert, in 1630, allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died and her widower, Sir Henry Oxenden, retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker's death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part of it, but squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>one</b> another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas Panton, but the pair eventually lost out to them. By the 1670s, Panton was developing the lands and, despite the claims of some distantly-related Bakers, he steadily built them up.|$|E

5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>one</b> Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{he joined}} Arsenal; his {{performances}} {{at the club}} were indifferent to begin with and attracted criticism from football pundits and fans alike.

He scored the winning goal against league rivals Manchester United which set his team on their way to securing the Premier League title and opened the scoring against Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final. In 2000, he moved to Barcelona in a deal worth £25million and became the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The club failed to win silverware during his stay and numerous managerial changes made him a peripheral player. A persistent knee injury prompted Overmars to announce his retirement in 2004, but he reversed his decision in 2008 and went on <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>one</b> season for Go Ahead Eagles before retiring again.

5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which they fly {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top.
