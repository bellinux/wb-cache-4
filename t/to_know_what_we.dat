500|$|The cookery author Clifford A. Wright {{wrote in}} 1999: [...] "There {{really is no}} such thing as 'Mediterranean cuisine'. At the same time, we seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> mean when we use the expression..." [...] Wright argued that David's book itself was largely about {{specifically}} French Mediterranean food, pointing out that [...] "only 4 percent of her recipes come from North Africa or the Levant".|$|E
2500|$|While still a student, Ashcroft {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in {{a revival of}} J. M. Barrie's Dear Brutus opposite Ralph Richardson, {{with whom she had}} been greatly impressed when she saw him in Charles Doran's touring company while she was still a schoolgirl. She graduated from the Central School in 1927 with London University's Diploma in Dramatic Art. Never much drawn to the West End or stardom, she learned her craft with mostly small companies in fringe theatres. Her first notable West End role was Naemi in Jew Süss in 1929, an extravagantly theatrical production, in which she won praise for the naturalism and truth of her playing. In the same year she married Rupert Hart-Davis, then an aspiring actor, later a well-known publisher. He later described the marriage as [...] "a sad failure: we were much too young <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted... after much agony we parted and were duly divorced. Nowadays Peggy and I lunch together perhaps {{once or twice a year}} in a Soho restaurant and have a lovely nostalgic-romantic talk of shared memories of long ago. She is a lovely person and the best actress living." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mike Love said [...] "some of {{the words}} were so totally {{offensive}} to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E

6000|$|S. You're right--every time. Those girls--why, all they'd {{have wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> was <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted done, {{and then they}} wouldn't have done it--the mischievous young rascals! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a good idea," [...] replied George; [...] "but we {{will also}} see a lawyer in town, so as <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ought <b>to</b> do now." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "What I do is {{definitely}} detective work," [...] she explains. [...] "Astronomers want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> happened. <b>We</b> look for evidence. We have to piece {{it all together}} like forensic scientists of the sky." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> offence <b>we</b> are charged with," [...] Malcolm said angrily. [...] "Things {{have come to}} a pretty pass, indeed, when quiet drovers are to be hauled before magistrates without rhyme or reason." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Master Bridgenorth, {{since you}} {{act as a}} magistrate, I desire to be treated {{according}} {{to the laws of}} England; and demand <b>to</b> <b>know</b> of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are accused, and by whose authority we are arrested?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I suppose so—although it is {{a rule of}} {{the works}} for the men to keep silent {{regarding}} precious stones. No one but myself and the general manager are supposed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have on hand.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About ghosts!" [...] {{said the}} Doctor, after a pause, which nobody broke or was {{expected}} to break. [...] "Ghosts, sir! That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> are <b>we</b> doing here in this blanked old mausoleum of Calaveras County, if it isn't to find out something about 'em, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|THEY {{asked us}} {{considerable}} many questions; wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> covered up the raft that way for, and laid {{by in the}} daytime instead of running --was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I: ...|$|E

6000|$|The girl {{dropped into}} a chair {{opposite}} her, and began to pull her fingers through the long tangle of her hair, while she drew her breath in sighs that broke at times on her lips; some tears fell down her cheeks unheeded.
