40|$|Sparse {{principal}} component analysis is a very active research area in the last decade. It produces component loadings with many zero entries which facilitates their interpretation and helps avoid redundant variables. <b>The</b> classic <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> is another popular dimension reduction technique which shares similar interpretation problems and could greatly benefit from sparse solutions. Unfortunately, {{there are very few}} works considering sparse versions of <b>the</b> classic <b>factor</b> <b>analysis.</b> Our goal is to contribute further in this direction. We revisit the most popular procedures for exploratory <b>factor</b> <b>analysis,</b> maximum likelihood and least squares. Sparse factor loadings are obtained for them by, first, adopting a special reparameterization and, second, by introducing additional ℓ 1 ℓ 1 -norm penalties into <b>the</b> standard <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> problems. As a result, we propose sparse versions of <b>the</b> major <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> procedures. We illustrate the developed algorithms on well-known psychometric problems.

40|$|<b>Factor</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{a widely}} used {{statistical}} method for exploring and modeling multivariate data. <b>The</b> standard <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> model assumes that <b>the</b> underlying <b>factors</b> and errors are independent. This dissertation discusses statistical issues involved in using a new model where factors and errors are uncorrelated but dependent. The proposed model is useful in representing the heteroscedasticity, i. e., the dependency of error variability on individual <b>factor</b> scores. Statistical <b>analysis</b> based on the model is not straightforward, because factors are not directly observable;Graphical diagnostic procedures for detecting the factor-error dependency or the heteroscedastic error structure are suggested. The effect of the heteroscedasticity on <b>the</b> standard <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> inference procedures is investigated. It is shown that the inferences for <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> loading parameters are still approximately valid under modest factor-error dependency. Two procedures for fitting <b>the</b> heteroscedastic <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> model are proposed. Both methods are developed without assuming particular distributional forms for factors and errors. Asymptotic inference procedures for the model parameters and for assessing heteroscedasticity are also developed based on the modelfitting methods. Such inference procedures are shown to be valid for any unspecified conditional error distribution given factors, and for any factor types including fixed and serially correlated factors;The heteroscedastic <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> approach is particularly useful for factor score estimation. Estimators of <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> value for an individual are introduced, and their individual-specific estimated variances are presented. The proposed methods are shown to produce accurate and efficient inferences for underlying factor scores;Large sample theory and comprehensive simulation studies are presented {{in support of the}} proposed approach.

50|$|Trofimova, who {{was doing}} her Ph.D. in Rusalov’s lab in early 1990s {{suggested}} that the trait of impulsivity reflects the speed of initiation of immature (emotionality-based) behavioral response, whereas Tempo and Plasticity relate to speed of more integrated behavioural response. She suggested therefore that all three traits relate to speed of an integration of an action. Her alternative activity-specific model of temperament included Empathy and Sensation seeking as orientation-related traits and also suggested a re-arrangement of Emotionality traits. The STQ-77 model is therefore based on Rusalov’s model and also on Luria’s theory related to three neuroanatomic systems (sensory-informational, programming and energetic) regulating human behavior. This model first appeared as an architecture of the Compact version of the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> of the STQ-77 data received on Russian and Canadian samples confirmed a separation between the factors related to motor-physical, social-verbal and mental aspects of behaviour.|$|E
50|$|However, one big {{technical}} {{difference between}} Cattell's five Global Factors and popular five-factor models was Cattell's insistence on using oblique rotation in <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> whereas Goldberg and Costa & McCrae used orthogonal rotation in their factor analysis. Oblique rotation allows the factors to correlate with each other, whereas orthogonal rotation restricts the factors from correlating with each other. Although personality traits {{are thought to}} be correlated, using orthogonal factor analysis makes the factors easier to understand and to work on statistically in research. This {{is one of the reasons}} the Big-Five traits have definitions that are different from the 16PF global factors. For example, as seen in the table below, in Cattell's model the primary personality trait of Dominance (Factor E) is strongly located in the Independence/Accommodation global factor which represents a quality of fearless, original thinking and forceful, independent actions. However, other popular big five models consider Dominance as a facet of several Big-Five traits, including Extraversion, Dis-Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Thus Dominance is spread across a range of Big-Five factors with little influence on any one (Cattell & Mead, 2008). Below is a table that shows how the 16 primary factors are related to the five global factors of the 16 Personality Factor theory. Compare with the Hierarchical Structure of the Big Five. Also, note that factor B is considered separate from the other factors because it is not a part of the hierarchical structure of personality in the same way as the other factors.|$|E
50|$|Spearman had {{an unusual}} {{background}} for a psychologist. In his childhood he was ambitious to follow an academic career. He first {{joined the army}} as a regular officer of engineers in August 1883, and was promoted to captain on 8 July 1893, serving in the Munster Fusiliers. After 15 years he resigned in 1897 to study for a PhD in experimental psychology. In Britain, psychology was generally seen as a branch of philosophy and Spearman chose to study in Leipzig under Wilhelm Wundt, because Spearman had no conventional qualifications and Leipzig had liberal entrance requirements. There he met Krueger and Wilhelm Wirth, both of whom he admired. He started in 1897, and after some interruption (he was recalled to the army during the Second Boer war, {{and served as a}} Deputy Assistant Adjutant General from February 1900) he obtained his degree in 1906. He had already published his seminal paper on <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> of intelligence (1904). Spearman met and impressed the psychologist William McDougall who arranged for Spearman to replace him when he left his position at University College London. Spearman stayed at University College until he retired in 1931. Initially he was Reader and head of the small psychological laboratory. In 1911 he was promoted to the Grote professorship of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic. His title changed to Professor of Psychology in 1928 when a separate Department of Psychology was created.|$|E

40|$|<b>Factor</b> <b>analysis</b> is a {{statistical}} method {{used to describe}} a set of variables based on common dimensions. <b>Factor</b> <b>analysis</b> that is often used is <b>the</b> classical <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> with principal components method.
