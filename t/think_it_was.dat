5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{really special}} to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together {{of a very}} specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

25|$|I think Neal {{did a lot}} of {{marvelous}} {{things for}} us, because even though what he did was a different thing and not quite the style but sort of a different sound, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite musical.|$|E
25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a {{reflection}} of the total anxiety and emotion of that period. There's {{a hell of a lot}} of spontaneity about that album. We went in with virtually nothing and everything just came pouring out.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} her illness has been debated by contemporaries and historians. Secretary of Giovanni Francesco Commendone claimed that her illness {{was caused by}} her use of {{contraceptive}} measures. Radziwiłłs in their letters debated whether she had a sexually transmitted disease. There were persistent rumors that she was poisoned by Bona Sforza. Modern historians tend to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> cervical or ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Media {{across the}} nation began speculating whether the vote was not an {{indication}} of dissatisfaction with the PUP administration; most seemed to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> Most political analysts credited the UDP with smart selection, timely deduction and ruthless campaigning, whereas the PUP {{did not seem to}} put their all into the campaign, perhaps wiped out from the protests the previous year.|$|E
25|$|Opinions {{about the}} {{importance}} and reach of P2 differ. Some see the P2 as a reactionary, shadow government ready to preempt a take over of power {{in case of an}} electoral victory of the Italian Communist Party. Others <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nothing more than a sordid association of people eager to improve their careers by making powerful and important connections. Nevertheless, P2 was implicated in numerous Italian scandals and mysteries.|$|E

25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} means. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting {{has to do}} with a lot of things. Color is among the things it {{has to do with}}. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E
25|$|On February 20, 2006, the National Football League {{announced}} that Williams had violated the NFL drug {{policy for the}} fourth time. His mother reportedly {{said she did not}} <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> another marijuana violation, and that he may have been in India when {{he was supposed to be}} tested. On April 25, 2006, Williams was suspended for the entire 2006 season. It has been suggested that the substance may have been an herb related to his interest in holistic medicine.|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E

25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, I {{feel that the}} energy of the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there. It was great.|$|E
25|$|Historians <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{shortly after}} the {{discovery}} of wine itself, the alcoholic product of fermented grape juice, that cultures realized its value as a trade commodity. Although wild grapes of the Vitis genus could be found throughout the known world and all could be fermented, it took some degree of knowledge and skill to turn these grapes into palatable wine. This knowledge was passed along the trading routes {{that emerged from the}} Caucasus and Zagros Mountains down through Mesopotamia and to the Mediterranean, eventually reaching Phoenicia. Specific varieties of grapevines of the V. vinifera species were identified as especially favorable for winemaking, cuttings of which were spread via these trade routes.|$|E
25|$|In 1828 Maria and Emily {{joined a}} {{boarding}} school in Paris, which later influenced scenes in Maria's second novel Love’s Sacrifice in 1868. A year later they {{were removed from the}} school due to Emily's poor health and after their father was appointed captain of the port of Gibraltar in 1831 he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to appoint another governess. Though their formal education was at an end, Maria and Emliy continued to improve themselves by travelling extensively and became expert linguists through their visits to France, Spain and Italy, reading books from their father's extensive library, and became acquainted with many intellectuals of the age through their father's contacts.|$|E

25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the hope that people would <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E
25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem {{was the first to}} see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
