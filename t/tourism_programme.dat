40|$|At {{its general}} term, this paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} guest lecturers in higher education. More precisely, the paper considers the role of guest lecturers in <b>tourism</b> Management <b>programmes</b> taught to student in Universities. The paper examines theory and literature relating to tourism studies and higher education in general. It discusses the relevance of guest speakers in universities and examines their contributions towards <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes.</b> The paper discusses lecturers in tourism degrees suggesting that they might lack industry experiences but are still required to deliver theories to students and are seen as classroom managers and student mentors. The paper further investigates how lecturers and guest speakers are perceived as two different entities by students where lecturers are seen as classroom managers and guest speakers are seen as the industry knowledge providers. As internationalization of education becomes the focus of higher education institutions that aim to deliver education in a more international context, guest speakers that address local practical occurrences become less appealing. With the rapid spread of distant learning and online education, the paper concludes that guest lecturers are not the solution for perfect academic experiences in higher education in general and specifically in <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{think about}} higher {{education}} in tourism is to understand that professors need specific knowledge of its field of {{work as well as}} knowledge of pedagogical practices. Nevertheless, a great number of professors see themselves just as experts in one specific field of work, and act based on tacit knowledge, common sense and mimetically reproduced models. A paradox can be revealed: even though scientific research on tourism is growing, the same pace is not detected in teaching practices for education in <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes.</b> At the course Teaching Practices: Planning and Operation, at the Tourism Master Programm at Universidade de Caxias do Sul, theoretical and practical reflections led to rethinking teaching practices in higher education <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes.</b> From students point of view, outcome was positive, mainly compared with their own comprehension habilities at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the course and when enrichment due to epistemology of learning are identified...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluated}} {{the quality of}} tourism education in Nigeria higher education. The problem of poor quality of tourism education in Nigeria’s higher institutions prompted the study. Archival research was used with evaluation reports as secondary data, twenty evaluation reports for different polytechnics from the National board for technical education (NBTE) from 1995 - 2012 were assessed. The evidence from the documents shows {{that the quality of}} teaching and evaluation is fair. The programmes resources are fairly good, and most of the teachers do not have a postgraduate qualification in tourism related courses. It is therefore recommended that the institutions running <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes</b> in Nigeria need to introduce self -assessment of programmes and not rely on the NBTE accreditation which comes up in three years. Also there is need for a staff development policy that will encourage Tourism educators to further their education; The Tertiary Educational Trust Fund (TETFUND) should focus on developing staff of tourism education because it is an area of study in Nigeria that lacks qualified personnel. With the way higher institution in Nigeria are finding interest in <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes,</b> having good quality programmes will not only produce better professionals but it will help in offering better services in the industry and maximizing the impacts of the business...|$|R

50|$|She {{represented}} Malaysia in Miss Tourism International 2003 {{and placed}} Top 15. In 2004, Lee represented Malaysia in the Miss Chinese Cosmos beauty pageant. During the proceedings, she spoke Chinese rather stammeringly, which observers suggested {{could be a}} barrier to her carrying out her duties as title-holder; nevertheless, {{she went on to}} win the top prize. In media interviews following her victory, she stated that she hoped to become an actress. The following year, she entered Jinan University's Chinese Department as a short-term student to study Chinese. Her oral skills showed significant improvement compared to the Miss Chinese Cosmos proceedings, but she was still not able to read or write Chinese aside from her own name. She hoped that studying at Jinan University would help her to become literate in Chinese and appreciate Chinese culture. She returned to Malaysia in 2005. By 2007, she had appeared in two Chinese-language television series in Malaysia, and worked as a promotional model for Pepsi, Matsushita, and Sony.

40|$|There is {{remarkable}} {{consistency in the}} evolution of university-level <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes</b> around the world, especially when such programmes evolved out of the polytechnic system. After a relatively slow incubation period, <b>tourism</b> education <b>programmes</b> tend to undergo a period of rapid expansion, where both the number of providers and student demand increase dramatically. Most academics feel this growth is unsustainable and predict that a shake-out in programmes is inevitable. Australia {{was one of the first}} countries to pursue university-level <b>tourism</b> education <b>programmes</b> aggressively as part of national policy. As such, it is evolving through its life cycle ahead of many other jurisdictions. The Australian experience may, therefore, be a precursor to what could happen in other jurisdictions. This paper reports on a qualitative study of what senior Australian tourism academics feel the future will be for the sector. Most feel that Australia is now in the late maturity or early decline stages of the tourism education life cycle. Consequently, most predict a consolidation of programmes, although there is much debate about which programmes will thrive and which will falter. They also believe that fee-paying postgraduate programmes may be the catalyst to revive the life cycle. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examines the guiding considerations which not-for-profit volunteer tourism sending organisations utilise in designing and implementing volunteer <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes.</b> These considerations encompass overarching factors which affect the strategic and operational direction which those sending organisations take, influencing {{their choice of}} activities and providing the framework for their programmes. The study explores the vision and mission statements of not-for-profit sending organisations along with their programme principles so as to reveal the guiding considerations which underpin the implementation of volunteer <b>tourism</b> <b>programmes.</b> Eleven guiding considerations were determined, with the five most frequently occurring listed in rank order as: Interaction, Needs of Host Community, Participant-Focused Benefits, Host Community–Focused Participation and Quality of Life. The fact that three guiding considerations focused heavily on the impact on, and needs and involvement of, the host community, is a promising indication that not-for-profit sending organisations place strong emphasis on a host-community-led strategy that keeps their programmes relevant to key beneficiaries. The needs of the participants are not neglected, however, with participant-focused benefits, such as the learning and adventure components of trips, being a prominent guiding consideration {{to emerge from the}} analysis. Lastly, bringing mutual benefits and positive interaction between host communities and volunteer tourists is also a key focus of these organisations. This research contributes to the limited literature on volunteer tourism sending organisations and offers an initial insight into the motivations and criteria that mould programmes from the perspective of these organisations. ...|$|R
40|$|Volunteer tourism {{seems to}} be {{gradually}} gaining its popularity and is currently a fast-emerging industry in Malaysia, particularly in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. However, many previous studies merely explored its market niche and the various kinds of volunteer tourism issues. In addition, {{most of the studies}} concentrated on volunteer tourists, volunteer students and volunteer hosts. This study, therefore, was intended to explore the viewpoint of tourism players in particular the top management of dive tour operators with regards to volunteer tourism, and to know their involvement in a volunteer <b>tourism</b> <b>programme</b> that the dive tour operators had participated in. The results of this study illustrated that the significance of volunteer tourism is not only to the community and the environment but also to the country as a whole. Another highlighted part is location, cost, and time of the programme. The volunteer <b>tourism</b> <b>programme</b> is seen by the tour operators as beneficial to the community and host as well as the environment. The findings also show that volunteer tourism is an activity which includes travel and volunteer work without attempting to receive anything in return and this was fully understood by the top management of dive operators...|$|E
