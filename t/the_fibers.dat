5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion.

At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption.

5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. <b>The</b> <b>fibers</b> arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, <b>the</b> <b>fibers</b> are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{to gain a better}} {{understanding}} of the changes occurring in softwood strength properties and fiber wall structure after mechanical treatment was applied to the chip/fiber matrix during kraft cooking. Mechanical treatment of fibers during industrial and laboratory production of pulp is common. In the pulp mill the pulp is mixed, pumped and shear forces are applied to <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> at different temperatures and under different chemical conditions. The main objective of this research was to investigate <b>the</b> reasons for <b>fiber</b> strength loss and to examine the changes that really affect fiber strength. Fiber damage, changes in <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> wall structure, reduced single softwood kraft fiber strength and fiber deformations (curl, kinks and dislocations) all affected <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> network properties. Mechanical treatment at the end of kraft cooking conditions resulted in fiber damage such that single fiber strength was reduced. This increased with increasing treatment temperature. It was concluded that both mechanical treatment at the end of cooking and homogenisation at room temperature of kraft pulp <b>fibers</b> increased <b>the</b> number of <b>fiber</b> deformations. <b>The</b> increase in <b>fiber</b> deformations did not reduce single fiber strength but did affect the strength properties of <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> network. <b>The</b> <b>fiber</b> damage induced by mechanical treatment also decreased the z-directional strength of <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> network, which was concluded to be due to separation of the structural elements on <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> surface layer. <b>The</b> separation of structural elements could enhance the irregularities on <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> surface layer and so reduce the bonding area. The bulking of <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> surface layer, e. g. more separated layers, might reduce the ability to resist z-directional stresses. The effect of mechanical treatment on spruce fibers was more severe than on <b>the</b> corresponding pine <b>fibers.</b> <b>The</b> spruce <b>fibers</b> developed more deformations and damage as a result of mechanical treatment. The reasons for the lower bonding and strength properties of <b>the</b> damaged <b>fibers</b> could be due to differences in <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> wall structures of spruce and pine. Overall the results suggested that fiber damage induced by mechanical treatment during cooking changed <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> wall pore structure in such a way that the number of links (between fibrill aggregates) in the fibril (aggregate) skeleton of <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> wall decreased. <b>The</b> reduced contact in the fibril aggregate skeleton of <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> wall (because of fewer restrictions) affected the cell wall structure so that it could no longer support stresses in <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> network. <b>The</b> zero-span tensile strength of fibers was not dependent on <b>the</b> degree of <b>fiber</b> deformation, but according to the hypothesis presented above, on the 3 -dimensional arrangement of the structural elements in <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> wall.
