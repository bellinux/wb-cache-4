Bond again meets Goodhead and finds out that she is a CIA agent.|$|E

5|$|Across Iowa they {{followed}} an existing road about 275 miles (443km) to Council Bluffs, following a route that {{is close to}} current U.S. Route 6. After crossing the Missouri River, they paused {{for a few days}} at a Mormon outpost in Florence, Nebraska (now part of Omaha), for repairs, before beginning the remaining 1,030-mile (1,658km) journey along the Mormon <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> Salt Lake City.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} expired, Chapman {{returned}} to Iowa, relocating in 1843 to Agency City in Wapello County. In 1844, {{he served as}} a delegate to Iowa’s Constitutional Convention, which was held in Iowa City and led to the entry of Iowa into the Union as the 29th state in 1846. Chapman left Iowa in 1847, traveling the Oregon <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> the Oregon Country.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the onset}} of winter, the Barlow, Rector, and Palmer parties were forced to leave their wagons on the mountain's eastern foothills. Palmer left on horseback for Oregon City, while Barlow and Rector blazed a <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> Oregon City on foot. Sam Barlow later {{returned}} with partner Philip Foster to establish the Mount Hood Toll Road, which {{became known as the}} Barlow Road.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass {{on the north side of}} Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the race}} was capped at 25 entries. When the Quest 300 starts in Whitehorse, its course follows the main Yukon Quest trail until the Stepping Stone {{hospitality}} stop. From there, it turns southwest, ending in Minto Landing, Yukon. The Fairbanks route follows the main <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> Circle, then reverses course, ending in Central.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} constructing a greenway and connecting trail along Roaring Brook. Planned trails in the greenway include the North Pocono rail trail and {{a link to}} the Nay Aug Park. The conservation plan recommended linking such a <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. A proposed pedestrian loop trail would have a footbridge over the stream.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side of the notch, the Wildcat Range is a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles are {{extremely}} difficult, and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock scrambles. This part of the trail is frequently bypassed by following the ski area's Polecat <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> the summit of DPeak.|$|E
5|$|The long horseback {{ride from}} Merced {{remained}} {{a deterrent to}} tourists. Three stagecoach roads {{were built in the}} mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road (June 1874), Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874), and the Wawona Road (July 1875). A road to Glacier Point was completed in 1882 by John Conway, and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883, which roughly followed the Mono <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> Tuolumne Meadows.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{starting line}} is in Whitehorse on First Avenue, near the former White Pass and Yukon Route train station, which today houses the Canadian offices of Yukon Quest International. Shortly {{after leaving the}} starting line, racers follow the frozen Yukon River north out of town. Crossing onto the Takhini River, mushers follow it north to the Klondike-era Overland Trail.

5|$|After graduating, Deady began {{teaching}} {{to pay off}} a debt incurred for his education, {{and began to read}} law. He read law in St. Clairsville, Ohio, under the guidance of judge and former Congressman William Kennon. Deady passed the Ohio bar on October 26, 1847, and began practicing law in St. Clairsville at the office of Henry Kennon. He remained there until on April 17, 1849, he began his overland journey over the Oregon <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> the newly created Oregon Territory.|$|E
5|$|An {{abandoned}} sailboat drifts into New York Harbor and is boarded by harbor patrol officers. One {{is killed}} by a zombie, which falls overboard after being shot by another officer. The police question the boat owner's daughter, Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), who claims she hasn't seen her father for months. At the morgue, the officer's corpse stirs. Anne meets journalist Peter West (Ian McCulloch), and the pair follows her father's <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> the Caribbean island Matul. En route, they befriend Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay), who are sailing around the area and agree {{to take them to}} Matul.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} end, Highway3 turns south onto Centennial Road and then east onto Talbot Line, {{following}} the historic Talbot <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> east of Aylmer. This mostly straight and rural portion passes through several small villages before the Talbot Trail splits from it to follow Elgin/Norfolk County Road38 through Straffordville. Highway3 meanwhile curves northeast and passes through Tillsonburg, encountering Highway19. It then curves east and travels {{parallel to the}} St. Thomas and Eastern Railway to Courtland, remerging with the Talbot Trail and snaking towards Delhi, now within Norfolk County.|$|E

5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E
5|$|Canopy Development, a green {{development}} company from Northampton, Massachusetts, owns {{a portion of}} the former rail bed in Rosendale. It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting the <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed. The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail.|$|E
5|$|Cornelius {{was born}} in Missouri, on November 16, 1827, to Elizabeth and Benjamin Cornelius. In 1845, Thomas and his family {{traveled}} over the Oregon <b>Trail</b> <b>to</b> the Oregon Country {{and set up a}} farm on the Tualatin Plains, north of what would become the community of Cornelius. After the Whitman Massacre in late 1847, Thomas volunteered for the militia of the Oregon Provisional Government in 1848. The militia prosecuted the Cayuse War in an attempt to punish those responsible for the killings at the Whitman Mission.|$|E
