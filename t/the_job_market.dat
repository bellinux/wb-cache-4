5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> is {{knowledge}} and service based {{and the largest}} employment sectors are healthcare and social services, trade, education, consulting, research, industry and telecommunications. The municipality has more high and middle income jobs, and fewer low income jobs, than the national average. Today {{the majority of the}} largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade, transport and media. The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of Midtjylland, and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy. The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium-sized companies mainly focused on research and development.|$|E

25|$|The Kenyan {{government}} has failed in implementing systems that may brush away cases of housing inequality in the country. The Kenyan education systems is criticized for producing half-baked individuals who lack the necessary skills in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> {{has failed to}} absorb {{a significant number of}} graduates, hence a high rate of unemployment. In the process, these graduates are forced to seek accommodation in poor surrounding such as Kibera hence increasing the cases of people living in poor conditions.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, {{more women}} were joining the work force, so, {{by the early}} 1980s, working women were no longer {{considered}} unusual. As a way to proclaim themselves as equals in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market,</b> women started to dress more seriously at work. Popular clothes for women in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> include knee-length skirts, wide-legged slacks, a matching blazer, and a blouse of a different color. Kitten-heeled shoes were often worn. Formal shoes became more comfortable during this period in time, with manufacturers adding soles that were more flexible and supportive. The shoes with moderately spiked heels and relatively pointy toes from the very late 1970s remained a fashion trend.|$|E

25|$|The {{unexpected}} {{influx of}} ex-Nova teachers on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> led to immense numbers of applicants vying {{for a much}} smaller number of employment opportunities. Language education companies, even some outside Japan, attempted to tap into this labor force.|$|E

25|$|Many host {{governments of}} OFWs have {{protective}} policies and barriers {{making it difficult}} to enter <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> Japan has been known for rigorous testing of Filipinos in a way that make them look reluctant to hold up their part of the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement and solely enjoy the benefit of affordable manufacturing in the Philippines, not accepting and educating OFWs.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 {{an article}} was {{published}} {{that explains the}} differences in generations, observed with the employer's position, {{through the development of}} working conditions, initiated by the employer. This development is due to the competition of firms on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> for receiving more highly skilled workers. New working conditions as a product on the market have a classic product life-cycle and when they become widespread standard expectations of employees change accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Salaries play {{a crucial}} role in the {{tangible}} reward system. They are an important factor in attracting new talent to an organization as well as retaining talent. Compensating employees well is one way for an organization to reinforce an employee's value to the organization.

25|$|The {{period after}} World War I was {{disruptive}} in the United States as numerous veterans sought to re-enter <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> and society. The government had no {{program to help}} them. Racial antagonism erupted in 1919 as race riots of whites against blacks in numerous cities across the North and Midwest; {{it was called the}} Red Summer of 1919. Unlike in mob action in the South, blacks in Chicago and other cities fought back against these attacks. After the riots subsided, racial relations between blacks and whites remained strained and volatile.|$|E
25|$|In 1951 the IEV only {{accepted}} {{members that}} had chosen Indonesian citizenship and {{changed its name}} to the Indonesian name: 'Gabungan Indo Untuk Kesatuan Indonesia' (GIKI). All signs of goodwill towards the Indonesian Republic however did not mitigate anti-Dutch regulations by the Republican government and anti-Indo sentiments in general. Throughout the decade all Dutch language institutions for Indos continued to be eliminated. All schools, orphanages and retirement homes for Indos were closed by 1951. Widespread discrimination in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> made it impossible for most Indos to pursue meaningful careers, while simultaneously the existing social security benefits were terminated by the Republican government.|$|E
25|$|Meritocracy is a {{fundamental}} ideology in Singapore and {{a fundamental}} principle in the education system which aims to identify and groom bright young students for positions of leadership. The system places a great emphasis on academic performance in grading students and granting their admission to special programmes and universities, though this has raised concerns about breeding elitism. Academic grades are considered as objective measures of the students' ability and effort, irrespective of their social background.

25|$|The third great wave of {{domestic}} migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952–53. Many soldiers who returned after World War II {{made use of}} the GI Bill and went to college. Puerto Rican women confronted economic exploitation, discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the migration process on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> The women left their homes for the factories in record numbers. By 1953, Puerto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75,000 people left the island.|$|E
25|$|After the {{economic}} crisis of 1929 Indos {{were the first to}} truly comprehend the profound change initiated by the so-called ‘Dutch Ethical Policy’ (1900–1930). The relatively limited but high quality educational opportunities that had been opened to indigenous peoples had produced a large and growing number of Western style educated indigenous people competing on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> Jobs that were traditionally occupied by Indos were more and more taken over by indigenous people. As Indos numbered only 0.3 percent of the 60 million native people inhabiting the Dutch East Indies they came under increasing threat of marginalisation. At the same time the educated indigenous elite was also developing an Indonesian nationalist political agenda.|$|E
25|$|The police strikes {{took place}} {{at a time of}} social unrest, which was {{widespread}} in several English-speaking nations and colonies during 1919 in the first year after the Great War. Race riots broke out in Liverpool, London and seven other major ports. In some cases, Afro- and Caribbean British were competing with Swedish immigrant workers, and both with native men from the British Isles. The union and racial unrest, including police strikes, also occurred in major cities in the United States, Caribbean and South Africa in this period. The economic competition of veterans trying to re-enter <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> and social displacement after the war heightened racial tensions and was expressed through riots of whites against blacks.|$|E
