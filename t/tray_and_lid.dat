5000|$|There were {{numerous}} <b>tray</b> <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> compartments in Victorian trunks, ranging from basic to complex. A basic tray system comprised a hat box, a shirt compartment, a coin box, and a document box. A complex tray system, however, could consist two hat boxes, several other shirt compartments, a coin box, several document boxes and even secret compartments strategically placed {{so that people}} of unwanted access would pass up if not wary. Beautiful lithographs would be placed over the lids or dome of the trunk and truly capture the Victorian aesthetic of that day. There {{were numerous}} chromolithographs that a trunk maker could use, {{and they could be}} indicative of who the trunk was intended for, such as ladies or men. A bride's chest usually had a lot of floral pictures or lithographs of other ladies, while men's had pictures of [...] "village" [...] or country scenes. It was up to the malletier what to put on the lids and trays.|$|E

40|$|Polylactide (PLA), a {{biobased}} polymer, {{might prove}} suitable as eco-friendly packaging, if it proves efficient at maintaining food quality. To assess interactions between PLA and food, an oïl in-water model emulsion was formulated containing aroma compounds representing different chemical structure classes (ethyl esters, 2 -nonanone, benzaldehyde) at a concentration typically found in foodstuff (100 ppm). To study non-equilibrium effects during food shelf life, the emulsions were {{stored in a}} PLA pack (<b>tray</b> <b>and</b> <b>lid).</b> To assess equilibrium effects, PLA was conditioned in vapour contact with the aroma compounds at concentrations comparable to headspace conditions of real foods. PLA/emulsion interactions showed minor oil and aroma compound sorption in the packaging. Among tested aroma compounds, benzaldehyde and ethyl acetate were most sorbed and preferentially into the lid through the emulsion headspace. Equilibrium effects showed synergy of ethyl acetate and benzaldehyde, favouring sorption of additional aroma compounds in PLA. This should be anticipated during the formulation of food products...|$|E

30|$|Bacteria were {{isolated}} using trypticase soy agar (TSA) and selective agar thiosulphate–citrate–bile salts–sucrose agar (TCBS) for isolating Vibrio sp. The colony-forming unit (CFU) from fifth time serial dilution (10 − 5) {{was selected for}} colony counting. Gram staining also was done to identify Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Catalase test was done to identify Gram-positive bacilli. API kit (Biomerieux) API 20 E and API 20 NE were used to identify Gram-negative bacteria. Incubation box, <b>tray</b> <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> were prepared for the strip preparation. For the inoculum preparation, an ampule of API NaCl 0.85  % (2  ml) was selected and 1 – 4 colonies of bacteria were picked up using inoculation loop from the agar plate and then suspension was prepared with the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland. For the API 20 NE strip inoculation, test nitrate reduction (NO 3) and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside hydrolysis (PNPG) were inoculated by distributing the saline suspension into the tubes using Pasteur pipette. API AUX medium was added to approximately 200  µl of the remaining suspension into the ampule and was homogenized well. Tubes and cupules of test glucose fermentation (GLU) and Phenyl-acetate assimilation test (PAC) were filled with the suspension. Mineral oil {{was added to the}} cupules of 3 tests (GLU), arginine hydrolysis (ADH), and urea hydrolysis (URE) until convex meniscuses formed. The incubation box was closed and incubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h. After the incubation period, the strips were read by referring to the reading table. The reactions for (GLU, ADH, URE, aesculin hydrolysis test (ESC)), gelatine hydrolysis (GEL) and (PNPG) were recorded on result sheet. For NO 3 test, 1 drop of NIT 1 and 1 drop of NIT 2 reagents were added to NO 3 cupule. For tryptophan deaminase test (TRP), 1 drop of JAMES reagent was added and immediate reaction took place. NIT 1, NIT 2 and JAMES reagents were removed using pipette and test NO 3 and TRP were covered with mineral oil. Kit was reincubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h and all tests were read again except for NO 3, TRP and underlined GLU, which were only read once at 24  h. Identification is obtained with the numerical profile. Database (V 6.0) in the API web index was used by entering the seven digit numerical profile in the identification software for species identification.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} and heat sealing of lidding films to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the leak resistance (tightness) of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the sealing area, and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the <b>tray</b> geometry <b>and</b> dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure. The results show that the quality of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard <b>trays</b> <b>and</b> multi-layer polymer <b>lidding</b> films can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the <b>tray</b> manufacturing process <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> sealing process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|R

50|$|The erotic {{connotations of}} Nuage articulé, with its {{umbrella}} covered with natural sponges, embodied a dynamic sense of contradiction: bloom with stalk; sponge as symbol of nature, as a feminine utensil, which touched and cleaned naked female skin; umbrella as a masculine symbol {{of order and}} protection from natural forces. It thus became widely recognized among the Surrealists and their growing public. Geo Dupin, Paalen´s sister-in-law, remembered that Alfred H. Barr, Jr. had been extremely taken with Paalen´s object and had chosen not to buy it, for the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, only {{because it was too}} fragile and difficult to transport. Nuage articulé was published later in a more political context in the Surrealist magazine London Bulletin, together with a text by André Breton translated by Samuel Beckett with a comment that the sponge-umbrella would bring to mind another, sadly prominent, umbrella - that of Neville Chamberlain at the 1938 Munich Conference and the failure of the British policy of appeasement. Besides Nuage articulé, of which two versions are known and preserved In addition to Nuage articulé, Paalen presented other objects in the 1938 surrealist exhibition, such as: Potence avec paratonnerre (Gallows with Lightning Rod), a larger-than-life wooden gibbet with lightning rods and a dedication plaque to the German philosopher and experimental physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg; Le moi et le soi (The Ego and the Id); and a version of Chaise envahie de lierre. Perhaps inspired by the revolving doors used as movable walls for paintings and metaphorically called portes ‘revolver’ in the surrealist exhibition, Paalen designed a pistol shape from different small animal bones, which he fastened to a box with a <b>tray</b> <b>and</b> glass <b>lid</b> lined with black velvet. As in museum displays of valuable paleontological discoveries, he included its title on a copper plate inscribed ‘Le génie de l'espèce’ (The Genius, or Engineering, of the Species).|$|R

Barramundi are {{not difficult to}} accept artificial diets, resistant to disease and can grow faster in warm climates. System operation in Good Fortune Bay (GFB) Barramundi Farm in Kelso {{can be divided into}} nursery and grow-out management sections. The water source for nursery and grow-out is come from ground water with semi-recirculated system was applied. Every cage in the grow-out ponds has equipment with 4 -wheel paddlewheel aeration. Aeration is eminent usually at night when the dissolve oxygen (DO) level in the ponds drop. To prevent predation and disease, each cage is covered by oyster <b>tray</b> <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> nursery tanks are always cleaned to remove pathogens. In the nursery, pellet is given to fish and the pellet size increase depends on the fish size, whereas, fish are feed by floating pellet for grow-out fish. Moreover, farmers measure water quality like DO every morning and also take water sample for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate analysis once a month. GFB Barramundi Farm just sells their product domestically and not import to other country since the price of barramundi from South East Asia such as Indonesia and Vietnam is much cheaper even the quality is lower than Australia product. This is because the labor and production cost in Australia is higher than South East Asia...|$|R

50|$|For {{completely}} accurate results, {{the crucible}} is handled with clean tongs because fingerprints can add weighable mass to the crucible. Porcelain crucibles are hygroscopic, i. e. they absorb {{a bit of}} weighable moisture from the air. For this reason, the porcelain crucible <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> is also pre-fired (pre-heating to high temperature) to constant mass before the pre-weighing. This determines {{the mass of the}} completely dry crucible <b>and</b> <b>lid.</b> At least two firings, coolings, and weighings resulting in exactly the same mass are needed to confirm constant (completely dry) mass of the crucible <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> similarly again for the crucible, <b>lid,</b> <b>and</b> sample residue inside. Since the mass of every crucible <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> is different, the pre-firing/pre-weighing must be done for every new crucible/lid used. The desiccator contains desiccant to absorb moisture from the air inside, so the air inside will be completely dry.|$|R
