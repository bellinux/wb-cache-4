5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although there is little evidence of it before the 3rd century, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that both were painted by the same hand.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{generally}} dismiss {{these numbers}} as exaggerations. One approach {{to estimate the}} number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra marines, in addition to a probable 14 standard marines. Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry. Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000. However, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> around 25,000.|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: This report {{describes}} <b>the</b> 2014 <b>consensus</b> of <b>the</b> Taiwanese Dermatological Association (TDA) {{regarding the}} treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). <b>The</b> TDA <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> distributed to practices throughout Taiwan to provide recommendations for therapeutic approaches for AD patients to improve their quality of life. Methods: The information in <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> agreed upon {{by a panel of}} national experts at TDA AD consensus meetings held on March 16, May 4, and June 29, 2014. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> in part based on the 2013 Asia–Pacific AD guidelines and the guidelines of the American Academy of Dermatology, with modification to reflect the clinical practice in Taiwan. Results: The amendments were drafted after scientific discussions focused on the quality of evidence, risk, and benefits; all <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> contents <b>were</b> voted on by the participating dermatologists, with approval by at least 75 % for inclusion. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> provides a comprehensive overview of treatment for AD, with some local and cultural considerations for practitioners in Taiwan, especially the use of wet dressings/wraps, systemic immunomodulatory agents, and complementary therapies...|$|R

5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name {{derived from the}} Latin term elegans 'elegant'. He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 {{on the basis of}} darker female plumage. However, others have not observed this subsequently and <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that no separate subspecies are recognized. In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{historical}} sources explicitly state Ecgfrith's reason for attacking Fortriu in 685, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that it was to reassert Northumbria's eroded hegemony over the Picts. The most thorough description of the battle is given by Bede in his 8th century work Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) (completed c731), but this is still brief. Additional detail is given in the Irish annals of Ulster and Tigernach, and by the early Welsh historian Nennius in his Historia Brittonum (written c. 830).|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> highly {{influential}} in the 1950s and 1960s but weakened following the Vietnam War. Lippmann recanted his previous view, arguing that the public had taken a more sober approach to the war than the heads of government.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E

25|$|This {{view has}} been {{challenged}} by other writers, who state that Madhyamaka is not nihilistic {{but it is a}} middle way between nihilism and eternalism. Some scholars interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental absolute, while other scholars consider it a mistake. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that Nāgārjuna defended the middle way, one between nihilism and absolute eternalism, and sunyata as emptiness is the soteriological middle way.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no known}} fully {{accurate}} history of broomball. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that modern broomball originated in Canada.

These games, however, were played on a football field as early as the 1890s. From Canada the game spread south to the United States, becoming especially popular in Minnesota, where by the 1960s a broomball community was thriving.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority. This {{is not to say}} that the phase of art denoted by {{post-modernism}} is accepted, merely that the need for a term to describe movements in art after the peak of abstract expressionism is well established. However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} ice ages {{are not fully}} {{understood}} for either the large-scale ice age periods or the smaller {{ebb and flow of}} glacial–interglacial periods within an ice age. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> that several factors are important: atmospheric composition, such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years) changes in the earth's orbit around the Sun known as Milankovitch cycles, the motion of tectonic plates resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and ocean currents, variations in solar output, the orbital dynamics of the Earth–Moon system, the impact of relatively large meteorites and volcanism including eruptions of supervolcanoes.|$|E
