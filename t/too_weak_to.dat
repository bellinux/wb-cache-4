5|$|On 11 August 1828, Corder {{was taken}} to the gallows in Bury St Edmunds, {{apparently}} <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> stand without support.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have to molt to grow {{as their}} cuticle ("skin") cannot stretch. In some species males mate with newly molted females, which are <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> be {{dangerous}} to the males. Most spiders live for only one to two years, although some tarantulas can live in captivity for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 1997 he {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Order of Merit; by this point he was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> travel to London to receive it, so instead a {{representative}} of the Queen travelled to Whitchurch to present it to him.|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. Then {{his former}} atheistical {{thoughts}} and principles were <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> now <b>to</b> support {{him from the}} fears of eternal damnation.|$|R

5|$|Situated on {{the western}} fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines {{experiences}} frequent seismic and volcanic activity. The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction. Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily, though most are <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> be felt. The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The General never leaves South America. He {{finishes}} his journey in Santa Marta, <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> continue {{and with only}} his doctor and his closest aides by his side. He dies in poverty, a shadow {{of the man who}} liberated much of the continent.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|E
6000|$|But {{when the}} prince entered with the red-hot shovel his master only said, 'I am very ill to-day, and <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> even <b>to</b> touch your hand. You must return this evening, when I may be better.' ...|$|R

6000|$|We now {{approach}} {{a change of}} affairs. One day during a gleam of sunshine, and when the weather had moderated, {{the man at the}} masthead - <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> now <b>to</b> touch his hat, besides its having been blown away - called out, ...|$|R
5|$|By now, the {{division}} was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, {{the rest were}} badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E
5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> {{take on the}} role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired {{to care for the}} infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
6000|$|This {{she refused}} to do. [...] "No," [...] she loyally said, [...] "I am going with you," [...] and {{although}} I {{knew that she was}} choosing a dreary alternative I was <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> <b>too</b> selfishly <b>weak,</b> <b>to</b> prevent her self-sacrifice. We left that night at the usual hour and arrived in time to eat another farmer's breakfast with father and mother next morning. Aunt Susan was unable to meet us.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2016/17 season, Rod {{clearly stated}} that he would no longer play in the AHL, {{considering}} the league <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> compared <b>to</b> the National League. Should he not make the Sharks roster at the end of training camp, he would then rejoin Genève-Servette.|$|R
5|$|Madison {{traveled}} to Blue Lick Springs for his health {{soon after the}} election, but was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> return to Frankfort for the inauguration. A Bourbon County {{justice of the peace}} administered the oath of office on September 5, 1816 at the springs. Madison's only official act of office was the appointment of Colonel Charles S. Todd as secretary of state. He died on October 14, 1816, just weeks into his term, the first governor of the state to die in office. He is buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E
5|$|No {{operations}} {{are reported in}} Sicily {{for the first two}} years after the fall of Palermo. The Muslims were probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> react, and could not expect any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until his sudden death in August 833.|$|E
60|$|When {{first she}} {{interposed}} {{he had turned}} and faced her. Since then she knew that his eyes had remained fixed on her face. She felt the gaze, yet cared not to return it. He was <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> <b>too</b> simple <b>to</b> understand, and of her own actions she would be sole mistress; {{that had been the}} chief clause in the contract when she placed her hand in his.|$|R
6000|$|A human {{creature}} found <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> [...] <b>To</b> bear {{his human}} pain-- [...] (May Heaven's dear grace have spoken peace [...] To his dying heart and brain!) [...] For {{when they came}} at dawn of day [...] To lift the lady's corpse away, [...] Her bier was holding twain.|$|R
60|$|The villagers, {{when they}} heard that George Somers had returned, crowded to see him, {{offering}} every comfort and assistance that their humble means afforded. He was <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> however, <b>to</b> talk--he could only look his thanks. His mother was his constant attendant; and he seemed unwilling to be helped by any other hand.|$|R
5|$|On his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> {{leave his}} bedroom. The next {{night he was}} {{admitted}} to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his sleep of an intestinal blockage on 1 November, with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.|$|E
5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{ratification}} {{and implementation of}} the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E
25|$|In February 1943, {{approximately}} 10,000 Białystok Jews were {{deported to}} the Treblinka extermination camp. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> or sick <b>to</b> travel, were killed.|$|R
60|$|Campbell {{had been}} there already; so Tom took care to tell nothing which he had not told, expecting, and rightly, {{that he would not}} mention Elsley's having fired at him. Lucia was still all but senseless, <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> even <b>to</b> ask for Elsley; to attempt any meeting between her and her husband would be madness.|$|R
5000|$|As with Goring's horse, Newcastle's {{infantry}} {{were from}} <b>too</b> many <b>weak</b> regiments <b>to</b> list separately. On the battlefield they were formed into seven [...] "divisions".|$|R
5|$|Prior to the typhoon's {{arrival in}} China, {{officials}} evacuated 467,900people, {{many of them}} to government shelters across the region. It was estimated that about 30% of coastal houses were <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> withstand the winds from the typhoon. In addition, officials ordered the closure of all restaurants and entertainment venues. Ferry service near Shanghai was disrupted, and 9,900ships were moved to safer areas. In addition, several airports across the region were closed, including in Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} wooden poles used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe wooden logs set into the beaches of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean to disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these wooden defenses <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E
5|$|Scalia died in {{his sleep}} at age 79, his body {{discovered}} {{on the morning of}} February 13, 2016 in his room at Cibolo Creek Ranch in Shafter, Texas. He had gone quail hunting the afternoon before, and then dined. The justice was pronounced dead of apparent natural causes. His physician, Rear Admiral Brian P. Monahan, said Scalia had a history of heart trouble, including high blood pressure, and had recently been deemed <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> <b>to</b> undergo surgery for a torn rotator cuff.|$|E
50|$|After the book's publication, Black {{spent several}} years lecturing at women’s clubs and lived in New York. Black spent his summers in a cabin on Freemont Older's {{property}} in California, next to a pool. When MacMillan asked Black to write another book, he was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> even <b>to</b> swim, according to Mrs. Fremont Older. He didn't write another book.|$|R
50|$|Exploring, Joe discovers {{a hidden}} room upstairs, and {{breaking}} into it, discovers {{his father in}} very poor condition, <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> even <b>to</b> talk. They provide their father a stimulant, and Frank relates that while Sergeant Johnson was tying up the prisoners, he noticed that they both had twisted claws branded on the tips of their index fingers.|$|R
40|$|In western Europe, {{the gradual}} {{expansion}} {{of economic activity}} continued, but an investment-led rebound has not yet set in. Austria's export industry benefited from the growth in export markets {{as well as from}} the gain in international price competitiveness. The recovery is <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> however, <b>to</b> ease the problems in the labor market. Modest Recovery Continues...|$|R
