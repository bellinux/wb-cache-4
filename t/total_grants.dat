In 2001, the New Markets and Community Renewal initiative was passed by Congress; it invested $25 billion in new incentives for growth in low-income communities to create nine new Empowerment Zones, bringing the total created under Clinton to 40. The low-income housing tax credit was increased to build an additional 700,000 units of affordable housing, and the New Markets Tax Credit was created, which encouraged venture capital firms to support small-business startups and rural development. In addition, 40 Renewal Communities were created with targeted, pro-growth tax benefits to spur robust outside investment.

40|$|Rich {{nations are}} often {{compared}} {{on how much}} they share their wealth with poorer countries. The Nordics and the Netherlands, it is noted, are the most generous with foreign assistance, while the United States gives the least aid per unit of gross domestic product. In 2002, the final reports of both the International Conference on Financing for Development, in Monterrey, Mexico, and the World Summit on Sustainable Development, in Johannesburg, judged donors on aid quantity too, calling on them all to move toward giving at least 0. 7 percent of their national income in aid, as few now do. (UN 2002 a, p. 9; UN 2002 b, p. 52) The measure of aid implicitly or explicitly referenced in all these comparisons and benchmarks is “net overseas development assistance ” (net ODA), which {{is a measure of}} aid quantity defined by the donor-funded Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in Paris.

40|$|This {{analysis}} uses panel {{data from}} thirty-five departments {{over the period}} 2001 - 2011 to analyse the effect of grants from central government on local revenue mobilisation in Côte d’Ivoire. The study considers the two components of local own revenue in Côte d’Ivoire: tax revenue (LTR) and non-tax revenue (LNTR). To perform the investigation, the analysis {{is based on a}} carefully-constructed novel dataset, and very recent and appropriate econometric estimators (Grouped Fixed Effects (GFE)). The GFE method assumes that unobserved heterogeneity can be constant and/or varying over time among individual departments. We combine this method with Instrumental Variable (IV) regressions in a two-stage least squares procedure to control for endogeneity of grants. Overall, the results show a statistically significant and positive effect of central grants on local mobilisation of tax and non-tax revenue. Thus, the study finds that central grants to municipalities do not displace local revenue, but instead lead to higher revenue. However, the effect on tax revenue is more important than that on non-tax revenue. A 10 per cent increase in <b>total</b> <b>grants</b> to local government is associated with a 4. 1 per cent increase in tax revenue mobilised by local administration, while increasing non-tax revenue by only 1. 8 per cent. We also find that, although conflict has a negative impact on mobilisation of local revenue, this impact remains generally limited. The conflict is not significant at 5 per cent statistical significance...|$|E
40|$|Samoa, a {{small island}} country located {{centrally}} in the South Pacific region, is very vulnerable to national disasters. As with other Pacific island countries, Samoa is also disadvantaged by remoteness, with Australia and New Zealand being the closest countries situated several thousand kilometres away. Population growth has averaged a low 0. 6 per cent per annum over the past decade, a rate well below the natural rate of population growth of around 2. 4 per cent. The difference is accounted for by emigration, mainly to New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, the United States and Australia, {{to the degree that}} it is believed there are as many Samoans living overseas as there are in Samoa itself. Heavy and persistent emigration has eased the pressure on the domestic economy and, while giving rise to substantial inflows of migrant remittances, has also meant a continual loss of skills to the domestic economy. Remittance transfers from overseas migrants comprise {{a substantial portion of the}} economy, both in the balance of payments and as a source of income for the population, currently amounting to around US $ 85 million or US $ 500 per capita. Largely as a result of these substantial inflows of migrant transfers, gross national income tends to be significantly above GDP; for example, it was some 30 per cent above GDP in 1992. Official aid transfers are also substantial, with <b>total</b> <b>grants</b> and concessionary loans totalling US $ 50 million or US $ 290 per capita in recent years. Such aid transfers finance much of the public sector investment. The economic fortunes of Samoa over recent years have largely been affected by a series of supply-side shocks, notably cyclone devastation in 1990 and 1991 and the collapse of taro, a leading export crop, as a result of the viral disease, taro leaf blight. These shocks have had a dramatic and adverse effect on the economy an...|$|E
