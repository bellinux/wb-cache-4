5|$|Empty {{scuba tanks}} or scuba tanks {{pressurized}} {{at less than}} 200kPa are not restricted as hazardous materials. Scuba cylinders are only allowed in checked baggage or as a carry-on if <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve is completely disconnected from <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> has an open end {{to allow for a}} visual inspection inside.|$|E
5|$|Keeping <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{slightly}} pressurized at {{all times}} during storage and transportation reduces the possibility of inadvertently contaminating the inside of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> with corrosive agents, such as sea water, or toxic material, such as oils, poisonous gases, fungi or bacteria. A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out-of-gas incident, <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> will normally still contain some pressure and unless <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> had been submerged deeper than where the last gas was used {{it is not possible}} for water to get in during the dive.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> carries stamp markings providing required information about <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are small, <b>the</b> valve chests may {{be located}} between <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b> For larger <b>cylinders</b> <b>the</b> valve chests are usually {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> but, in early locomotives, they were {{sometimes}} underneath <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{centrifugal}} compressor is described which includes {{at least one}} pair of cylinders arranged in coaxial alignment and supported for angular displacement about a common axis of rotation normally disecting a common longitudinal axis of symmetry for <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> are characterized by ported closures located at the mutually remote ends thereof through which <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are charged and discharged, {{and a pair of}} piston heads seated within <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and supported for floating displacement in compressive strokes in response to unidirectional angular displacement imparted to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used saturated steam. <b>The</b> high-pressure <b>cylinders</b> had piston valves arranged above <b>the</b> <b>cylinders,</b> while <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> had Allen Richardson balanced slide valves, also arranged above <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and all actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Copper {{steam pipes}} were arranged {{on each side}} of the dome and passed vertically down outside the boiler to the steam chests of <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> <b>The</b> exhaust from <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>cylinders</b> passed through a receiver pipe along the centre of the engine to <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> <b>The</b> exhaust from <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> passed to <b>the</b> smokebox and blast pipe through a pipe fitted with flexible connections.|$|R
5|$|These {{are used}} to cover <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve orifice when <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> is not in use to prevent dust, water or other {{materials}} from contaminating the orifice. They can also help prevent the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> does not pressurise the plug, {{making it difficult to}} remove.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> stands on from impact with <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test involves pressurising <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 {{of the working}} pressure) and measuring its volume {{before and after the}} test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> fails the test and must be permanently removed from service.|$|E
25|$|No.42 had outside {{cylinders}} and was {{to remain}} <b>the</b> only outside <b>cylinder</b> locomotive on <b>the</b> NCC for forty years, {{until it was}} joined by No.16 in 1914. Steam was admitted to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> by outside steam pipes mid-way along the smokebox. Lubrication to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> was by cylinder taps mounted over <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of plunging breaking waves {{with a pair}} of cylinders placed in tandem is investigated using an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The model is validated using experimental data for total wave forces and free surface elevations for breaking-wave interaction with a single cylinder. Wave interaction with tandem cylinders is investigated for four different wave impact scenarios on <b>the</b> first <b>cylinder</b> and six different distances between <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> in each scenario. Wave forces on <b>the</b> upstream <b>cylinder</b> are generally found to be less than the forces on a single cylinder for a particular scenario. The force on <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder</b> is lower than the force on <b>the</b> upstream <b>cylinder</b> when <b>the</b> breaker tongue impacts <b>the</b> first <b>cylinder.</b> Under conditions in which the breaker tongue impacts <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder</b> around <b>the</b> wave crest level, the wave force on <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder</b> is higher than the force on <b>the</b> upstream <b>cylinder.</b> <b>The</b> wave forces experienced by <b>the</b> tandem <b>cylinders</b> is highly influenced by the location of the breaking point with respect to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>cylinders...</b>|$|R
40|$|As is {{theoretically}} {{indicated by}} Maniar & Newman (1997), waves incident {{to a long}} array of equally-spaced vertical cylinders can be trapped among <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and extreme water-surface elevations among <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> or very large hydrodynamic forces on <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> can be induced. However, actual water-surface elevations or hydordynamic forces cause...|$|R
5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> then increases to above ambient as <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas supply to <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves {{a risk of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
5|$|Excess heat can {{be removed}} by {{immersion}} of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a cold water bath while filling. However, immersion for cooling can also {{increase the risk of}} water contaminating the valve orifice of a completely depressurized tank and being blown into <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> during filling.|$|E
50|$|The valve chests {{are usually}} {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> but, in older locomotives, the valve chests were {{sometimes}} located alongside <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and inserted through slots in the frames. This meant that, while <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> were outside, <b>the</b> valves were inside and could be driven by inside valve gear.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation of Strouhal frequencies, forces and flow structures {{resulting from the}} interference between two tandem cylinders of different diameters. <b>The</b> upstream <b>cylinder</b> diameter (d) was varied from 25 mm to 6 mm, while <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder</b> diameter (D) of 25 mm was unchanged, the corresponding diameter ratio, d/D, being 1. 0 ∼ 0. 24. The spacing between <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> was 5. 5 d. At this spacing, the shear layers separated from <b>the</b> upstream <b>cylinder</b> roll up alternately, forming a vortex street in the gap between and behind <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Two dominant frequencies are detected behind <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder</b> at d/D = 1. 0 ∼ 0. 4. One {{is the same as}} detected between <b>the</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and <b>the</b> other is of relatively low frequency and is probably generated by <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder.</b> Whilst <b>the</b> former remains unchanged, the latter increases with decreasing d/D, due to an increase in the incident flow velocity of <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder.</b> <b>The</b> time-averaged drag on <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder</b> also increases with decreasing d/D, though the fluctuating forces drop because vortices impinging upon <b>the</b> downstream <b>cylinder</b> are impaired by decreasing d/D.

5|$|In South Africa {{cylinders}} may {{be filled}} {{for commercial purposes}} by {{a person who is}} competent {{in the use of the}} filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> to fill it. <b>The</b> <b>cylinder</b> must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> must be made, and specified details of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.|$|E
5|$|International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air {{states that}} {{provided}} that pressure in diving cylinders {{is less than}} , these can be carried as checked in or carry-on baggage. It maybe necessary to empty <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> to verify this. Once emptied, <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve should be closed to prevent moisture entering <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of some items permitted by ICAO, and airlines and security screening agencies {{have the right to}} refuse the carriage of certain items.|$|E
5|$|Some {{national}} standards require that <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve includes a bursting disk, a {{pressure relief device}} that will release the gas before <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear, {{controlled by}} steam reversing gear. <b>The</b> <b>cylinders</b> and steam chests were formed in three separate castings. <b>The</b> high-pressure <b>cylinders</b> were arranged with piston valves, while <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> were arranged with Richardson balanced type slide valves, arranged above <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b> <b>The</b> steam chest covers of <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> were designed with inclined joint faces {{to facilitate the}} handling of the valve and refacing of the ports during servicing.|$|R
5|$|The {{internal}} {{volume is}} commonly quoted {{in most countries}} using the metric system. This information is required by ISO13769 to be stamped on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> with fresh water. This {{has resulted in the}} term 'water capacity', abbreviated as WC which is often stamp marked on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> shoulder. It's almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> makes <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain {{neutrally}} buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from}} the {{pressure}} vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> getting into the gas passages when <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
50|$|An {{externally}} obvious {{difference was}} the main steam pipes from the dome to <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>cylinders,</b> which was no longer arranged vertically down directly to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> along <b>the</b> outside of the boiler, but internally via the superheater in the smokebox and from there along {{the underside of the}} running boards back to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b> <b>The</b> result was a much better performing locomotive with an increased tractive effort brought about by <b>the</b> larger <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
25|$|The tandem {{compound}} {{first appeared on}} the Erie Railroad in 1867. Like the Vauclain compound, a {{tandem compound}} has each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders driving a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank; but unlike the Vauclain compound, <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are mounted fore and aft of each other. The rear wall of <b>the</b> forward <b>cylinder</b> is usually <b>the</b> forward wall of <b>the</b> rear <b>cylinder.</b> <b>The</b> piston rod of <b>the</b> rear <b>cylinder</b> {{is connected to the}} crosshead in the usual way, but <b>the</b> forward <b>cylinder</b> may have its piston rod, or rods, in either of two forms: either the piston rod of <b>the</b> rear <b>cylinder</b> is extended forwards to also carry the forward piston; or if <b>the</b> forward <b>cylinder</b> be <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>cylinder</b> (and thus larger in diameter than <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>cylinder</b> behind), it may have two long piston rods which pass above and below, or to either side, of <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>cylinder</b> in order to reach the common crosshead.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{different}} from the M180 where <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are cast together in pairs, <b>the</b> M123’s <b>cylinder</b> spacing is uniform like in the M130. So, instead of cooling ducts cast between <b>the</b> <b>cylinders,</b> there are slots sawed in the cylinders’ partition walls, traversed by cooling water.|$|R
5|$|The {{thickness}} of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> walls {{is directly related}} to the working pressure, and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A low-pressure cylinder will be more buoyant than a high-pressure cylinder with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two parts}} to this problem: <b>The</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the diver.|$|E

50|$|The {{carrying}} axle {{was in the}} form of an Adams axle. <b>The</b> rear <b>cylinders</b> were <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>cylinders,</b> which drew all of their steam directly from the centrally located steam dome. <b>The</b> front <b>cylinders</b> were fed with the exhaust steam of <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> Steam was supplied to <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> by fixed pipes, the ball joint of which was located in the pivot.
