500|$|While {{the book}} Lone Survivor chronicles Marcus Luttrell's 1999 {{enlistment}} and training, {{as well as}} his 2005 deployment to Afghanistan, Berg decided that the film adaptation would focus mainly on the events of the failed United States Navy SEALs mission Operation Red Wings, as well as the bonding and camaraderie of Luttrell and his fallen teammates. Prior to writing the screenplay, Berg met with the families of the deceased. [...] "My research started with meeting the families of the SEAL teammates who were killed", he said. [...] "I went to New York and met the Murphys. I went to Colorado and met the Dietzes, and I went to Northern California and met the Axelsons. After spending time with them, you realize that <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> the best and the brightest; they were the stars of the families. The grief and the wounds are still very raw. You would have to be inhuman to not feel the responsibility when that kind of grief gets shared with you." [...] Berg also expressed that he was motivated by the families to make the story as realistic as possible; his goal was [...] "to put [...] into the experience of what these guys went through. And it was obviously a traumatic and violent and exhausting experience".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. A {{critic for}} PopSugar.com called [...] "Pandora" [...] a [...] "fantastic episode" [...] and {{was pleased that}} Pandora's character [...] "graduated from being random light relief {{and we got a}} real insight into her life". They praised each of the [...] "superb" [...] guest actors, particularly Harry Enfield, David Baddiel and Sally Phillips, who she thought played Angela [...] "brilliantly". Digital Spy's Neil Wilkes gave the episode a positive review, describing it as [...] "probably the most outrageous of the series to date". He wrote that the tension between Effy and Freddie [...] "set things up nicely" [...] for the following episode, which focused on Freddie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that the episode included [...] "a lot of confusing straight relationship drama" [...] and felt like she was [...] "stuck in high school hell". She wrote, however, that the brownie-making scene was [...] "so ridiculous it's kind of funny" [...] and likened Skins to [...] "Gossip Girl on crack". Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that within the ensemble cast [...] "most of <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> so unlikable", though he attributed this to the series [...] "show us their weaknesses". He found Pandora to be more likable, however, believing that her innocence was [...] "more representative of youth than most of the other characters". One reviewer for lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com called the episode [...] "must-see TV", while another reviewer expressed disapproval of the use of Katy Perry's song, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", in promotional videos for the episode.|$|E

According to Chuck D, [...] "We had tight dealings with MCA Records and {{were talking about}} taking three guys that were left over from New Edition {{and coming up with}} an album for them. The three happened to be Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe, later to become Bell Biv DeVoe. Ralph Tresvant had been slated to do a solo album for years, Bobby Brown had left New Edition and experienced some solo success beginning in 1988, and Johnny Gill had just been recruited to come in, but [...] had come off a solo career and could always go back to that. At MCA, Hiram Hicks, who was their manager, and Louil Silas, who was running the show, were like, 'Yo, <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> left out in the cold. Can y'all come up with something for them?' It was a task that Hank, Keith, Eric, and I took on to try to put some kind of hip-hop-flavored R shit down for them. Subsequently, what happened in the four weeks of December [...] was that the Bomb Squad knocked out a large piece of the production and arrangement on Bell Biv DeVoe's three-million selling album Poison. In January , they knocked out Fear of a Black Planet in four weeks, and PE knocked out Ice Cube's album AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted in four to five weeks in February." [...] They have also produced local talent such as Son of Bazerk, Young Black Teenagers, Kings of Pressure, and True Mathematics—and gave producer Kip Collins his start in the business.|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, children gain {{social competence}} from {{being involved in}} the Special Olympics. Parents of athletes, however, have also noted that learning rules, working with others, setting goals, the relationship between hard work and success, and coping with failure were all attributes gained by participating in the Special Olympics program. Many parents see an increase in their children's peer relationships after they join teams and get involved in the Special Olympics. Many parents appreciate the program for themselves as well; the program becomes a welcoming environment for parents, and they are able to feel connected and understood by the other parents involved in the program. Many parents felt pressured in community-based programs to take responsibility and pull their kids out of the activity if anything went wrong. <b>These</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> then looked at as jeopardizing the integrity of the program they were involved in.|$|E
