5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. <b>Tamoxifen,</b> a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from <b>tamoxifen</b> generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of <b>tamoxifen</b> approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} endometrial cancer include obesity, {{diabetes}} mellitus, breast cancer, use of <b>tamoxifen,</b> never {{having had a}} child, late menopause, high levels of estrogen, and increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, {{show that there is}} some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Women with {{a family}} history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of <b>tamoxifen,</b> a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including <b>tamoxifen,</b> hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent <b>tamoxifen</b> therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
25|$|Patients with variant {{forms of}} the gene CYP2D6 (also called simply 2D6) may not receive full benefit from <b>tamoxifen</b> because of too slow {{metabolism}} of the <b>tamoxifen</b> prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling <b>tamoxifen</b> to include information about this gene in the package insert.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} literature is complex {{with respect to}} the activity of <b>tamoxifen,</b> and care should be taken to establish whether <b>tamoxifen,</b> or the 4-hydroxy metabolite was used, especially in in vitro assays.|$|E
25|$|A {{beneficial}} {{side effect}} of <b>tamoxifen</b> is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When <b>tamoxifen</b> was launched as a drug, {{it was thought that}} <b>tamoxifen</b> would act as an ER antagonist in all tissue, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. In contrast <b>tamoxifen</b> appears to be associated with bone loss in premenopausal women who continue to menstruate after adjuvant chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> {{treatment}} of postmenopausal women {{is associated with}} beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, <b>tamoxifen</b> can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition there is {{an increased risk of}} thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. <b>Tamoxifen</b> is also a cause of fatty liver, otherwise known as steatorrhoeic hepatosis or steatosis hepatis.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen-treated {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} show evidence of reduced cognition, a major side effect of <b>tamoxifen,</b> and semantic memory scores. However memory impairment in patients treated with <b>tamoxifen</b> was less severe compared with those treated with anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|Certain CYP2D6 {{variations}} {{in breast cancer}} patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for <b>tamoxifen</b> treatment. Genotyping therefore {{has the potential for}} identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of <b>tamoxifen</b> is associated with poor outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> is a {{competitive}} binder of the estrogen receptor {{and is often}} used in chemotherapy treatment of breast cancer. While 17-β-estradiol alone stimulated H19 transcription in MCF-7 cells, the addition of <b>tamoxifen</b> inhibited H19 transcription, demonstrating {{that there is a}} putative role of hormones in H19 transcription.|$|E
25|$|In McCune-Albright {{syndrome}} (MAS) <b>tamoxifen</b> {{has been}} used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. <b>Tamoxifen</b> has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys.|$|E
25|$|Global {{sales of}} <b>tamoxifen</b> in 2001 were $1,024 million.|$|E
25|$|However, one {{in vitro}} study in 2007 and later an in vivo study in 2008 {{have shown that}} <b>tamoxifen</b> induces {{apoptosis}} in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum IGF-I levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researches to express concern giving <b>tamoxifen</b> to growing individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as part of a}} treatment plan for Riedel's thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> is {{typically}} given to premenopausal women to inhibit activity of estrogen receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> (TMX), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Nolvadex among others, is a {{medication}} {{that is used to}} prevent breast cancer in women and treat breast cancer in women and men. It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. <b>Tamoxifen</b> is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> was {{discovered}} in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Tamoxifen</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale price in the developing world is about 0.07 to 0.23 USD per day. In the United States it costs about 2 USD a day.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine may {{decrease}} {{the effects of}} CYP2D6 substrates that are prodrugs, such as codeine, tramadol, and <b>tamoxifen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Codeine, clopidogrel, <b>tamoxifen,</b> and {{warfarin}} a {{few examples}} of medications that follow the above metabolic pathways.|$|E
25|$|As of 2004, <b>tamoxifen</b> was the world's largest selling {{hormonal}} {{drug for}} the treatment of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> is a SERM. Even {{though it}} is an {{antagonist}} in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and {{has been linked to}} endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason <b>tamoxifen</b> is typically only used for 5 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> {{itself is}} a prodrug, having {{relatively}} little affinity for its target protein, the estrogen receptor (ER). It is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 into active metabolites such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (afimoxifene) and N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen (endoxifen) which have 30–100 times more affinity with the ER than <b>tamoxifen</b> itself. These active metabolites compete with estrogen in the body for binding to the ER. In breast tissue, 4-OHT acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. <b>Tamoxifen</b> has 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas 4-OHT has 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally <b>tamoxifen</b> {{is used in}} {{treatment}} of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis.|$|E
25|$|Hormone therapies are a {{topic of}} current {{research}} in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include <b>tamoxifen,</b> letrozole, and anastrozole. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for <b>tamoxifen</b> in {{a small number of}} people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of estrogen receptor positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that taking the {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of <b>tamoxifen,</b> as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize <b>tamoxifen</b> into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only <b>tamoxifen</b> had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs {{considered to be the}} most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in {{the risk of breast cancer}} recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs; Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine), did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and <b>tamoxifen</b> have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration.|$|E
25|$|While <b>tamoxifen</b> {{has been}} shown to antagonize the actions of {{estrogen}} in tissues such as the breast, its effects in other tissues such as bones has not been documented fully. There have been studies done in mice showing <b>tamoxifen</b> mimic the effects of estrogen on bone metabolism and skeletal growth. Thus increasing the possibility of pre-mature bone fusion. This effect would be less of a concern in adults who have stopped growing.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects may}} occur if kudzu is taken {{by people with}} hormonal-sensitive cancer, or those taking <b>tamoxifen,</b> {{antidiabetic}} medications, or methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> is used {{to treat}} {{infertility}} in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days 3–7 of a woman's cycle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> is {{currently}} {{used for the}} treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (ER+) breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. The use of <b>tamoxifen</b> is recommended for 10 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamoxifen</b> is one {{of three}} drugs in an anti-angiogenetic {{protocol}} developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays {{a significant role in the}} development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using myriad different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and <b>tamoxifen</b> – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, <b>tamoxifen</b> treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties.|$|E
25|$|SERMs are a {{category}} of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are raloxifene and <b>tamoxifen.</b> Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium. <b>Tamoxifen</b> is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and {{reduces the risk of}} invasive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1998 that the {{meta-analysis}} of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that <b>tamoxifen</b> saved lives in early breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidelines}} {{were based on}} studies of SERMs from the MORE, BCPT P-1, and Italian trials. In the MORE trial, the relative risk reduction for raloxifene was 76%. The P-1 preventative study demonstrated that <b>tamoxifen</b> can prevent breast cancer in high-risk individuals. The relative risk reduction was up to 50% of new breast cancers, though the cancers prevented were more likely estrogen-receptor positive (this {{is analogous to the}} effect of finasteride on the prevention of prostate cancer, in which only low-grade prostate cancers were prevented). The Italian trial showed benefit from <b>tamoxifen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{hormonal}} {{contribution to}} several categories {{of breast cancer}} subtypes was recognized during this time, leading {{to the development of}} pharmacological modulators (e.g. of oestrogen) such as <b>tamoxifen.</b>|$|E
