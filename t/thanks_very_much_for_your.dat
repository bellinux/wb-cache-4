I did enjoy the candy lots. Although my address has changed recently, the package reached me through “channels. ” I am using a {{temporary}} address at present, because I {{have been in}} the hospital for some time. Have recovered from my illness and expect to return to duty soon. When I am assigned, I will be able to send you a correct address. I do appreciate your remembering me—and hope that everyone has a Merry Christmas with the best for ’ 45. S/Sgt Paul Smedberg [Transcription ends...|$|E

It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|R

I wish to {{take this}} {{opportunity}} to inform you of a change of address. From Boston, I have moved to Washington D. C. and am now working in the Bureau of Personnel. Here is the new address: George A. Bunnell, Jr. 3516 10 th Street N. W. Washington, D. C. 2. 		I am a little late in doing this, but <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the Christmas present. The sweater which you sent me came in very handy during guard duty on cold nights in Boston. From the weather we have been getting here in Washington I am going to have to use it again soon. 3. 		You have received many letters from other Bryant graduates saying that they had found no other schools with a service club like yours. I will echo their statements. I have met many fellows who have attended many different business schools and collegs [sic], and none of them have attended schools that have service clubs like Bryant’s. 4. 		A word of advice to those of you studying typing. Learn how to use carbon. If you ever have to do any work for the Army, Navy, or any governmental agency you will use carbon, carbon, and more carbon.

There are several names on the list that I correspond with regularly and also a couple that I’ve been wondering about. However, in the letter itself you mentioned that you had sent me a package on May 28 th and as yet you had received not acknowledgement from me. But I did write you soon after receiving some camel cigarettes. If for some reason the letter did not reach you, I would like to express my thanks again now and also let you know that you have the correct address. How I’d like to get up to Rhode Island for a good swim. Here at Miami Beach we have plenty of bathing facilities, but during the summer the temperature of the water reaches 85 or 88 degrees, and after a swim you are not refreshed like you lucky folks are a home. There is one break we get here in Florida though, and that is we can go bathing and lay on the beach wile you are wrapped up in heavy winter clothing to keep warm. The ocean temperature averages around 70 or 75 degrees in the winter and it sure feels good. Even this simmer we are getting the breaks. So far the hottest day we have had has been 86 and I’ve seen by the Providence Papers that you have had much warmer days even though you can look forward to a cool day now and then. Well, again thanks for the letter and packages I’ve had from you folks. Keep up the good work, and {{best of luck to you}} all. Sincerely, T/Sgt. B. F. Bullock T/Sgt. Bertram F.

I simply came to feel that the editorial needs of comics.com and those of “Pibgorn” were becoming more and more divergent and incompatible. For this reason I asked to be released from my contract with United Media in order to secure a new online home for “Pibgorn.” United Media most graciously, and reluctantly, agreed. In short order I hope to get Pib back up and flying.Meanwhile, you have seen the most current installments of '"Pibgorn." [...] Hold that thought.
