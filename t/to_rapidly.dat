5|$|Karl {{originated}} {{in a strong}} tropical wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 13. The wave gradually became better organized, and it was declared Tropical Depression Twelve about 670miles (1,080km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands on the morning of September 16, as it headed westward in the open tropical Atlantic following the periphery of the subtropical ridge. That afternoon, the depression continued <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> organize and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl. Due to healthy outflow around an upper-level anticyclone over Karl and a favorable environment with the warmest sea surface temperatures of the year, rapid deepening began on the evening of September 17, with the storm developing a small eye and being upgraded to Hurricane Karl. With water around 28°C (83°F) and low wind shear, the cyclone continued <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> intensify on the morning of September 18. The intensity leveled off somewhat that afternoon as a strong Category2 hurricane with winds of 110mph (175km/h).|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics {{throughout most}} of the day on November3, the storm was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before leveling out as a Category 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on November7. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58mph (93km/h). By the next day, Florence lost its identity, while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|After {{passing the}} island, Erica {{accelerated}} and began <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> weaken {{in the presence}} of strong wind shear. As a result, the cyclone began a phase of extratropical transition as it quickly paced to the southeast. On 15 March, Erica completed this transition. The remnant low continued to the east-southeast, before the Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited office at Wellington, New Zealand (TCWC Wellington) issued their last advisory on Erica at 1800UTC on 16 March.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) from the center. Convection became displaced {{from the center of}} circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> moving troughs to the north.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of June23, Andres {{weakened}} to a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear, decreasing sea surface temperatures as it entered a more stable air mass. The system began <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> degenerate, as convection became dislocated from {{the center and the}} overall structure of Andres degraded. By 1200UTC on June24, the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100mi (155km) west of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Shortly after, the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure, no longer a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 7, the eye began to {{reappear}} and the storm turned towards the northwest and the foreword motion began <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> increase. Later that morning, Florence had developed a large, 35 to 40mi (55 to 65km/h) wide eye and the foreword motion continued to increase. The intensification continued and by the afternoon hours, Florence was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h). A strong extratropical cyclone located {{to the north of}} Florence was causing the storm to move towards the northwest at a rapid pace of 30mph (48km/h). Operationally, Florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity, but post season analysis determined that the storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherstatus late on November 7. By {{the morning of}} November 8, Florence weakened slightly to Category 1 status. The large system to the north continued to cause Florence to move at 58mph (93km/h). Since the storm was very close to a cold front, Florence was expected <b>to</b> <b>rapidly</b> transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that morning, Florence was absorbed into the extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane-force winds.|$|E
