40|$|Abstract- This paper deals {{proposes a}} {{medium access control}} (MAC) {{protocol}} for ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of integrated multimedia services on wireless links. The wireless ATM MAC protocol which incorporates dynamical polling, idle uplink (UL) data channel conversion, piggybacking and an intermptable priority splitting algorithm (named THBPSA) for resolving random access collisions is proposed and named TPICC. The effect of the priority splitting algorithm {{on the performance of}} the TPICC is simulated and compared with a counterpart of the TPICC which uses an unprioritised binary splitting algorithm (UBSA) in the RA slots. The effect of an invalid polling detecting (IPD) mechanism on the UL bandwidth efficiency is also simulated. The simulation results show that the THBPSA algorithm ensures a smaller medium access delay for realtime <b>traffic</b> <b>classes</b> than for non-realtime <b>traffic</b> <b>classes.</b> Comparing THBPSA with a priority scheduling scheme which is used in the base station (BS) and features packet time stamps, THBPSA provides realtime <b>traffic</b> <b>classes</b> with a much less UL packet delay than non-realtime <b>traffic</b> <b>classes.</b> The UL bandwidth used by the dynamic polling of realtime <b>traffic</b> <b>classes</b> is tolerable. ...|$|R

Furthermore, L2 can even interrupt or [...] "preempt" [...] an outgoing TC0 data frame to transmit a TC1 data frame. Additional arbitration rules apply to control frames: in essence these receive higher priority than data frames because they are small and essential for keeping traffic flowing.|$|E
