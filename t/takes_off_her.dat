5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E

Minogue enters a small room in the spacecraft, wearing a pink spacesuit, and subsequently <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> helmet and gloves; intercut scenes through the video has the spacecraft travelling through different space fields and atmospheres. By the first chorus, Minogue starts taking off parts of her spacesuit whilst spaceman from different rooms witness her. Next, she turns on a machine that projects smoke and distracts them. She then becomes fully nude by the second chorus; this marks Minogue's first video {{that she has been}} nude in until her 2001 advert campaign with Agent Provocateur. Another spaceman witnesses Minogue nude but covers herself with a red blanket, and closes the window. The video ends with Minogue laying on a soft bedding, turning the lights off, and the spacecraft traveling to another destination.|$|E
25|$|The second series {{begins with}} the newlyweds {{arriving}} from a honeymoon in Greece. The in-laws meet again at the Shipman's house in Essex, where Nessa has some shocking revelations– especially for Smithy, who learns that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he makes it clear he thoroughly dislikes the woman, he is generally civil and supportive towards her about their child. Meanwhile, Gavin and Stacey, living at Pam and Mick's house, run into trouble when Stacey struggles {{to find a job}} and becomes home-sick for Barry and her family. The couple try to overcome their problem by looking for an apartment or house in Essex, but Stacey is still dissatisfied and is considering moving back to South Wales to be with her family. In the final episode of the series, Stacey <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> wedding ring, much to the upset of Gavin, but this is interrupted by the news of Nessa unexpectedly going into labour a month early. Pam, Mick and Stacey hurry across to Wales, whilst Gavin rushes to find Smithy with Smithy's sister, Rudi (Sheridan Smith), eventually finding him in the pub watching football. They arrive to find that Nessa has given birth to a boy, Neil. Gavin and Stacey decide to put their differences aside and are together once again.|$|E

25|$|A subplot {{in which}} the Rohirrim are aided by the {{primitive}} Drúedain during their journey to the besieged Gondor is excised from the film. The Red Arrow brought by a messenger from Gondor to ask for aid is absent. Éowyn's presence on the battlefield is unknown to the reader until she <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> helmet, but in the film the audience is aware, {{as it would have}} been difficult to have Miranda Otto playing a man. When hope seems lost, Gandalf comforts Pippin with a description of the Undying Lands, which is a descriptive passage in the book's final chapter. The film depicts the Army of the Dead fighting in the Battle, whereas in the book they are released from service prior to this, after helping Aragorn defeat the Corsairs of Umbar at the port city of Pelargir in Lebennin; Aragorn's reinforcements are merely more Gondorians, and the Dúnedain, Aragorn's people (the rangers of the North). An unstoppable and invulnerable force, the Dead wipe out Sauron's forces. The film also cuts out several supporting characters, such as Halbarad, a friend of Aragorn's, who helps lead the Dúnedain, Beregond, a member of the Citadel Guard of Gondor, whom Pippin befriends, and Elladan and Elrohir, the twin sons of Elrond who deliver Aragorn's banner and accompany him to the Pelennor Fields. Elladan and Elrohir are replaced by Elrond in the film, instead delivering Andúril in Dunharrow, and then returning to Rivendell. In the books Aragorn isn't doubtful about his destiny, but had already decided to claim the throne of Gondor {{from the beginning of the}} Quest; thus, it was he who had the shards of Narsil forged to Andúril in Rivendell, carrying it from there on the whole journey.|$|E

500|$|Hannah Levin of the Seattle {{publication}} The Stranger {{analyzed the}} lyrics to the track [...] "Mrs. Jones", calling it a [...] "particularly rattling sketch of {{what appears to be}} a rape scene, with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives: the ugly attacker ("Look into the bloodrot, you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live"), the vengeful victim ("The abortion left an abscess / Don't ever talk to me like that again"), and the supportive narrator ("Just like a pro, she <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>her</b> dress / And she kicks you down in her snow white pumps")."

House believes the case to be over, but a dream that night causes him to realize that the bus driver is not the patient he saw suffering from symptoms; the crash merely dislodged the air bubble and caused the driver's problems.|$|E

500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her.

Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway.
