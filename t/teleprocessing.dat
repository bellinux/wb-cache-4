50|$|In September 1998, IBM {{announced}} <b>Teleprocessing</b> Network Simulator (TPNS) Test Manager (for TPNS V3R5) as a usability enhancement {{to automate}} the test process further {{in order to}} improve productivity through a logical flow, and to streamline TPNS-based testing of IBM 3270 applications or CPI-C transaction programs.|$|E
50|$|WEMSSA, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Eric Lutaud, contracted with GOAL Systems and eventually developer Leigh Lundin (author of DUCS Remote) for development, which focused on adding remote <b>teleprocessing</b> in Avignon, France. The result was WestiTAM, a 4k bi-sync module, which the Florida group expressed an interest in.|$|E
5000|$|Between them, {{these three}} {{products}} provided much needed third-party system software support for IBM's [...] "flagship" [...] <b>teleprocessing</b> product CICS, which survived {{for more than}} 20 years as a strategic product without any memory protection of its own. A single [...] "rogue" [...] application program (frequently by a buffer overflow) could accidentally overwrite data almost anywhere in the address space causing [...] "down-time" [...] for the entire <b>teleprocessing</b> system, possibly supporting thousands of remote terminals. This was {{despite the fact that}} much of the world's banking and other commerce relied heavily on CICS for secure transaction processing between 1970 and early 1990s. The difficulty in deciding which application program caused the problem was often insurmountable and frequently the system would be restarted without spending many hours investigated very large (and initially unformatted) [...] "core dump"s requiring expert system programming support and knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Note: In this configuration, TPNS transmits its {{generated}} {{data traffic}} from its MVS address space, first across a channel-adapter to its TPNS Control Program (TPNCP) {{running in a}} dedicated IBM 37x5 Communications Controller, and then across <b>teleprocessing</b> lines connected back-to-back between the TPNCP and the target IBM 37x5 channel-attached to the host system (server) under test and its subsystems, applications and databases/files.|$|E
50|$|The Terminal Application Processing System, {{known as}} TAPS, {{had been created}} by a Midtown Manhattan-based firm named Decision Strategy Corporation, which was founded by Michael J. Parrella. Intended to {{significantly}} reduce the development time for online, CRT terminal-based applications, TAPS had been around since 1974 and initially ran on IBM mainframes under the CICS <b>teleprocessing</b> monitor and the TCAM access method.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, IBM {{released}} DOS/VS {{with the}} IBM/370 {{and the first}} IBM 3270 terminals, and CFS began a rewrite for the new products. Former New York City IBMer, Leigh Lundin, wrote DUCS Remote, a bi-sync module to handle remote <b>teleprocessing.</b> The bi-sync handler was only 4k, in contrast to IBM's BTAM at 28k, QTAM at 36k, and TCAM at 42k, and VTAM which started at 48k.|$|E
50|$|The {{directory}} system was called AND - Alpha Numeric Directory. <b>Teleprocessing</b> users could store programs on disks, tapes, or the RCA RACE mass storage unit interfaced through an RCA 301 computer. Users could retrieve and edit programs through AND. The 1-inch magnetic tapes were block addressable, allowing AND {{to manage a}} directory file system interchangeably on any available magnetic storage (tape, disk, or RACE cards).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Teleprocessing</b> Network Simulator (TPNS) is an IBM {{licensed}} program, first {{released in}} 1976 {{as a test}} automation tool to simulate one or many network terminal(s) to a mainframe computer system, for functional testing, regression testing, system testing, capacity management, benchmarking and stress testing. In addition to its typical use as a test tool exchanging message traffic with a system under test, TPNS has been deployed: ...|$|E
5000|$|IDMS-DC : A <b>teleprocessing</b> system {{similar to}} IBM's CICS system. When {{it was first}} released, it was {{reported}} that IBM challenged Cullinane to prove that the code had not violated copyright. This suspicion was {{due to the fact that}} many internal CICS codes begin with the initials [...] "RH". Many IDMS-DC modules also begin with [...] "RH" [...] after it two authors, Nick Rini and Don Heitzmann, both employees of Cullinane.|$|E
50|$|With V2R3 (1985), ITPENTER was {{enhanced}} {{to run as}} a VTAM application, thus {{sending the}} data traffic generated by its simulated terminals or programmed resources (now defined as VTAM logical units) via the VTAM API to the application under test. This removed the requirement for a 37x5 and other dedicated <b>teleprocessing</b> hardware when using TPNS to test applications systems running under VTAM, such as CICS, IMS, DB2, ISPF, and other online transaction processing systems.|$|E
50|$|CIM {{continued}} to procure heavily-technical programming and consulting jobs and to sell GMT as a product. However, GMT {{was a tough}} product to sell to most executives {{because it was a}} very technical sale. Top management in many prospective companies usually did not have the technical knowledge to understand the requirements of a <b>teleprocessing</b> monitor. Consequently, CIM needed to find prospective sites with technically knowledgeable data processing (DP) managers or sites that gave significant executive power to their lead technicians.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s a Houston-based venture {{capitalist}} acquired {{a small group}} of companies which he named Information System Technologies (known as Insyte and pronounced “insight”). In 1974 Insyte acquired CIM’s promissory notes to gain control of CIM. Insyte replaced top management and made the decision to split the <b>teleprocessing</b> monitor from its key-driven access method and rename the two parts as Datacom/DC (for data communications) and Datacom/DB (for database). To emphasize the products’ relationship with Insyte, the company was renamed Insyte Datacom.|$|E
50|$|In {{its early}} releases, the TPNS program ITPENTER (the simulator) ran as a MVS {{procedure}} controlled from the MVS operator console. Its generated data traffic was transmitted from its MVS address space, first across a channel-adapter to its TPNS Control Program (TPNCP) {{running in a}} dedicated IBM 37x5 Communications Controller, and then across <b>teleprocessing</b> lines connected back-to-back between the TPNCP and the target IBM 37x5 channel-attached to the host system under test and its application subsystems (CICS, IMS, DB2, TSO/ISPF, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Prior to joining Amazon.com in 1997, Dalzell was Vice President of Information Systems at Wal-Mart {{starting}} in 1990. At Walmart he developed their datawarehouse strategy {{from the ground}} up giving their suppliers direct access to demographic sales information. From 1987 to 1990, Dalzell acted as the Business Development Manager for E-Systems, Inc. Prior to joining E-Systems, Inc. he served seven years in the United States Army as a <b>teleprocessing</b> officer. Dalzell received a B.S. in Engineering from the United States Military Academy at West Point.|$|E
5000|$|Seeking to {{capitalize}} on the brand of its most known entity, some other Informatics products were named with a [...] "IV" [...] in their title, including [...] "Production IV" [...] for planning in manufacturing and [...] "Accounting IV" [...] for the financial sector. Additional products included Life-Comm and Issue-Comm for the insurance sector, Minicomm and Intercomm for <b>teleprocessing</b> and communications, and CSS, for corporate shareholder processing. [...] In addition to packaged software, Informatics continued to make custom software and engage in professional services contracts.|$|E
50|$|A {{paper tape}} reader, the IBM 2671, was {{introduced}} in 1964. It had a rated speed of 1,000 cps. There were also a paper tape reader and paper tape punch from an earlier era, available only as RPQs (Request Price Quotation). The 1054 (reader) and 1055 (punch), which were carried forward (like the 1052 console typewriter) from the IBM 1050 <b>Teleprocessing</b> System. All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The paper tape punch from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price.|$|E
50|$|When CICS {{was first}} {{released}} by IBM {{in the late}} 1960s, it used IBM Assembler macros to generate the API system calls to the CICS <b>teleprocessing</b> monitor kernel. This was also true even if programs were written in COBOL or PL/1. Ken Dakin an independent programmer and CEO of APT Ltd. in the U.K., realized that by creating a middleware product, the problem could be solved for almost all situations. Ken Dakin approached IBM to market his product but received no interest at the time, {{despite the fact that}} tens of thousands of their clients application programs would need to be converted or rewritten for the new versions of CICS, costing many millions of dollars.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of {{automated}} reservations systems in the 1960s and 1970s the combination of ACP and PARS provided unprecedented scale and performance from an on-line real-time system, and for a considerable period ranked among the largest networks and systems of the era. In the early 1970s major US banks were developing major on-line <b>teleprocessing</b> applications systems and were in urgent need of ACP's high performance capabilities. ACP was made available by IBM to the banking industry in the mid-1970s. This system was used by the great majority of large airlines in the US and internationally; and its smaller 1970's version was used by many smaller regional airlines. PARS (and IPARS) was extremely successful, and it massively improved and revolutionized the efficiency of airlines passenger operations and their profitability.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teleprocessing</b> {{monitors}} {{were originally}} developed to allow several clients {{to connect to}} one server. However, they developed to what are now known as transaction processing monitors (TPMs). A TPM breaks down applications or code into transactions and ensures that all databases are updated in a single transaction. This is useful for airline reservations, car rentals, hotel accommodations, ATM transactions or other high volume transaction locations. TP monitors ensure that transactions are not lost or destroyed. Sometimes they {{are referred to as}} middleware, because the client sends the data for query or processing to the server database and then it is sent back to the user terminal. This can be accomplished remotely and by multiple users simultaneously. TP monitors are easily scalable allowing for increase in users and data processed.|$|E
50|$|The Air Force Data Systems Design Center (AFDSDC) was {{activated}} on 26 Oct 1967. The {{unit was}} located at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington D.C. Its {{mission was to}} analyze, design, develop, program, test, implement and maintain all automated data processing systems; incorporate HQ USAF-approved integration and interface requirements in assigned automated data systems; develop and maintain general purpose software required by assigned systems; and develop and recommend standards covering programming languages and documentation requirements for automated data systems. The AFDSDC moved to Gunter AFS in 1971 and has since gone {{through a number of}} transformations including: Headquarters Air Force <b>Teleprocessing</b> Center (1984); Headquarters Standard Information Systems Center (1985); Headquarters Standard Systems Center (1986); Headquarters Standard Systems Group (1995); 554th Electronic Systems Wing (2006), Enterprise Information Systems Directorate (July 2010), Business and Enterprise Systems (September 2011).|$|E
5000|$|System/360's {{hardware}} and operating systems {{were designed for}} processing batch jobs which in extreme cases might run for hours. As a result, they were unsuitable for transaction processing, {{in which there are}} thousands of units of work per day and each takes between 30 seconds and a very few minutes. In 1968 IBM released IMS to handle transaction processing, and in 1969 it released CICS, a simpler transaction processing system which a group of IBM's staff had developed for a customer. IMS was only available for OS/360 and its successors, but CICS was also available for DOS/360 and its successors. For many years this type of product was known as a [...] "TP (<b>teleprocessing)</b> monitor". Strictly speaking TP monitors were not operating system components but application programs which managed other application programs. In the 1970s and 1980s several third-party TP monitors competed with CICS (notably Taskmaster, Shadow and Intercomm), but IBM gradually improved CICS to the point where most customers abandoned the alternatives.|$|E
