Trauma could occur during injections of local anesthetic in the mouth, or otherwise during dental treatments, frictional trauma from a sharp surface in the mouth such as broken tooth, or from tooth brushing.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{childhood}} <b>trauma</b> <b>is</b> {{also associated}} with a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, <b>trauma</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to be the}} main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head <b>trauma</b> <b>is</b> fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of head <b>trauma</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to}} be influenced {{in part by the}} location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental <b>trauma</b> <b>is</b> extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E

25|$|<b>Trauma</b> <b>is</b> {{the sixth}} {{leading cause of}} death worldwide, {{resulting}} in five million or 10% of all deaths annually. It is the fifth leading cause of significant disability. About half of trauma deaths are in people aged between 15 and 45 years and <b>trauma</b> <b>is</b> the {{leading cause of death}} in this age group. Injury affects more males; 68% of injuries occur in males and death from <b>trauma</b> <b>is</b> twice as common in males as it is in females, this is believed to be because males are much more willing to engage in risk-taking activities. Teenagers and young adults are more likely to need hospitalization from injuries than other age groups. While elderly persons are less likely to be injured, they are more likely to die from injuries sustained due to various physiological differences that make it more difficult for the body to compensate for the injuries. The primary causes of traumatic death are central nervous system injuries and substantial blood loss. Various classification scales exist for use with trauma to determine the severity of injuries, which are used to determine the resources used and, for statistical collection.|$|E

This study aims to analyze publications and citations on trauma authored by academicians of emergency medicine. MethodsA literature search regarding <b>trauma</b> <b>was</b> performed on publications and citations authored by professors and associate professors of emergency medicine between the dates of 1994 and 2012 using the PubMed database. Academic citations were evaluated using Google Scholar. Publications were analyzed according to journal name, type of article, and the number of citations.

Citation ratios were 77. 4 % for original contributions and 56. 5 % for case reports. Animal experimental research articles constitute 11. 2 % of all trauma publications (n= 20).
