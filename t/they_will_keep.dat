Dismayed with the merger, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) condemns the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for initiating it, only to be yelled at. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is optimistic, assuring everyone that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> their jobs. A patient, Jodie Crawley (Adrienne Barbeau), and her son with schizophrenia, Tom (James Frain), is brought into {{the hospital with a}} moving growth inside her stomach, claimed to be an alien by her son.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{trade off}} between the high volume and {{throughput}} that continuous presses can manage versus {{the overall quality}} of the press juice compared to the potentially more delicate means of some batch presses. However, there are noticeable difference in the composition of the pressed juice from continuous presses that are taken {{from the beginning of the}} press (the 1st press section) with the least amount of pressure and movement versus the fractions that come further down the path. Often winemakers will have separate press pans under each section that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> apart and vinify separately.|$|E

25|$|During Christmas 1955, a young Hellboy is told a bedtime {{story by}} his adoptive father, Trevor Bruttenholm, {{of an ancient}} war between human and magical creatures. After the magical creatures are driven back by the humans, the goblin blacksmiths extend an offer to Balor, king of the elves, to build him an indestructible {{mechanical}} army. Encouraged by his son Prince Nuada, Balor accepts; the Golden Army subsequently decimates humanity. Regreting his actions, Balor forms a truce with the humans, that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> to the cities and the magical creatures to the forests. The crown to command the Golden Army, {{which can only be}} worn by one of royal blood, is split into three pieces. Nuada, disagreeing with the truce, leaves in exile.|$|E
500|$|At 13:32, {{during the}} zig-zag, it became {{apparent}} that Queen Mary would come too close to the cruiser and the liner's officer of the watch interrupted the turn to avoid Curacoa. Upon hearing this command, Illingworth told his officer to: [...] "Carry on with the zig-zag. These chaps are used to escorting; <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> out of your way and won't interfere with you." [...] At 14:04, Queen Mary started the starboard turn from a position slightly behind the cruiser and at a distance of two cables (about [...] ). Boutwood perceived the danger, but the distance was too close for either of the hard turns ordered for each ship to make any difference at the speeds that they were travelling. Queen Mary struck Curacoa amidships at full speed, cutting the cruiser in half. The aft end sank almost immediately, {{but the rest of the}} ship stayed on the surface a few minutes longer.|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it {{four out of}} five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers, it is [...] "equally possible <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves". Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..." [...] Lastly, Wagner observed that [...] "Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created".|$|E

2500|$|In the asylum, {{the doctor}} {{and his wife are}} first to arrive and both agree <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> her sight a secret. Several others arrive: the woman with dark glasses, the Japanese man, the car thief, and the young boy. The wife comes across the old man with the eye-patch, who {{describes}} the condition of the world outside. The sudden blindness, known as the [...] "white sickness", is now international, with hundreds of cases reported every day.

2500|$|While the game's primary {{gameplay}} modes {{were easily}} developed {{to account for}} unique abilities of all characters, the developers also had thought about a Capture the Flag mode for several years, recognizing that most team-based first-person shooters included some type of variant on this mode. The largest issue that this mode faced was the speed or warping abilities {{of some of the}} characters, like Tracer, which could pick up the flag and warp back to their base, leaving the other team unable to stop them. Thus they would either find matches reduced to players selecting the speediest characters, or having to put so many restrictions in place that the result game no longer felt like Overwatch. Over several iterations, they devised a scheme that they put to public testing in January 2017 through the [...] "Capture the Rooster" [...] special event to celebrate the Chinese New Year; here, to prevent speedy characters from running immediately after collecting the flag, they must wait a few seconds before they can run or use their special powers, leaving them vulnerable for that period. Initially having no plans to retain the Capture the Flag mode after the event, Blizzard announced that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> the event as a custom game mode with additional options.|$|E

50|$|These laws of {{thermodynamics}} apply even at very grand scales. For example, {{the motions}} and rotations of celestial bodies such as planets may appear perpetual, but are actually subject to many processes that slowly dissipate their kinetic energy, such as solar wind, interstellar medium resistance, gravitational radiation and thermal radiation, so <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not <b>keep</b> moving forever.|$|R

2500|$|On October 13, 2017, Humble Bundle {{announced}} it was acquired by IGN, a division of Ziff Davis Media. Humble Bundle will continue to operate as a separate entity within IGN, {{and according to the}} company, there are no plans to change their current business approach in the short-term. Instead, they see [...] "a lot of opportunities" [...] for the customer bases of both companies, according to Humble Bundle founder John Graham. [...] Graham said that the acquisition by IGN enables them to continue to do the same sales and charity promotions [...] "faster and better" [...] with IGN's resources backing them. IGN's executive vice president Mitch Galbraith said that they felt Humble Bundle was a [...] "great fit" [...] for IGN, and would also help IGN to [...] "give something back" [...] by supporting its charitable drives. As IGN publishes news and reviews of video games, Galbraith responded to several concerns about conflicts of interest, saying that they [...] "will strike the right balance when it comes to our coverage of Humble Bundle and the games they sell" [...] {{as a result of the}} acquisition. Among steps to avoid conflicts, Galbraith said that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> a firm separation between the IGN editorial staff and Humble Bundle, and will implement policies to report disclosure of ownership when IGN reports on games featured on Humble Bundle's store or promotions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final section}} opens with {{discussion}} of a plan developed for Dmitri's escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor in Siberia. The plan is never fully described, {{but it seems to}} involve Ivan and Katerina bribing some guards. Alyosha approves, first, because Dmitri is not emotionally ready to submit to such a harsh sentence, secondly, because he is innocent, and, third, because no guards or officers would suffer for aiding the escape. Dmitri and Grushenka plan to escape to America and work the land there for several years, and then to return to Russia under assumed American names, because they both cannot imagine living without Russia. Dmitri begs for Katerina to visit him in the hospital, where he is recovering from an illness before he is due to be taken away. When she does, Dmitri apologizes for having hurt her; she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter during the trial. They agree to love each other for that one moment, and say they will love each other forever, even though both now love other people. The novel concludes at Ilyusha's funeral, where Ilyusha's schoolboy friends listen to Alyosha's [...] "Speech by the Stone". Alyosha promises to remember Kolya, Ilyusha, and all the boys and keep them close in his heart, even though he will have to leave them and may not see them again until many years have passed. He implores them to love each other and to always remember Ilyusha, and to keep his memory alive in their hearts, and to remember this moment at the stone when they were all together and they all loved each other. Alyosha then recounts the Christian promise that they will all be united one day after the Resurrection. In tears, the twelve boys promise Alyosha that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> each other in their memories forever, join hands, and return to the Snegiryov household for the funeral dinner, chanting, [...] "Hurrah for Karamazov!" ...|$|E

50|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, a {{power of}} {{attorney}} may be oral and, whether witnessed, will hold up in court, the same {{as if it were}} in writing.
