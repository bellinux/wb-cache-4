The following week it rose to number 39, and on March 16 of the same year, it reached the top position. It became Streisand's second number one and seventh top five album, with the other number-one being People (1964). <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> spent two weeks at the highest position before falling to number four on March 30. It continued dropping on the charts but managed {{to stay within the}} top 10 of the list for a total of six weeks. The Recording Industry Association of America changed its certification status to Platinum for shipments upwards of 1,000,000 sales, and again on September 23, 1998, <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> was certified for selling over 2,000,000 copies.

5|$|ButterFly is {{the sixteenth}} studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand. It was {{released}} on October 1, 1974 by Columbia Records. After releasing <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> earlier in 1974, a collection predominantly consisting of previously released songs, Streisand recorded her first album of entirely new material in over three years. Recorded throughout 1974 and primarily a contemporary pop record, it also incorporates music from the reggae and R genres. All of the tracks on ButterFly are cover songs produced by Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters, originating from artists like Bob Marley, David Bowie, Evie Sands, and Graham Nash.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Streisand's vocals {{and found the}} record capable of being extremely successful. However, some critics felt the album was not carefully planned out and Streisand was acting out the tracks rather than actually singing them. Commercially, <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> topped the Billboard 200 in the United States and reached the top ten on album charts in Australia and Canada. It also entered the charts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Due to strong sales, it has since been certified 2x Platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E

Of the speculation, she said [...] "There's this bloody rumour going around that because we're on Eleven it's {{going to be}} raunchy. I'm {{not going to do}} that. Why would I do that?

5000|$|Comparing {{ourselves}} to others is something humans {{do all the}} time. [...] "In doing so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> acknowledging not so much our sameness to othersor our difference, but rather the commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because {{each one of us}} is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of absolute similarities and a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similarities in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> different from one another and differences in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same. That <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to do this {{is a function of the}} genuinely historical process that is human ontogeny".|$|R

But his overall career was flourishing with the critical and box office hit Jeremiah Johnson (1972); the political satire The Candidate (1972); the hugely popular period drama <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> (1973); and the biggest hit of his career, the blockbuster crime caper The Sting (1973), which {{became one of the}} top 20 highest-grossing movies of all time when adjusted for inflation and for which he was also nominated for an Oscar.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, as {{producer}} and main actress, Lin {{came back to}} Taiwan with the television film Mother Mother, playing a role of an aggressive mother. Lin stated that she will continue to film one Taiwanese series per year. The same year, Lin starred in the romance TV series <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were.</b> This drama marks Lin's return to Taiwan television after a 10-year absence. As main actress and producer, Lin received favorable comments from both critics and audiences. The series not only received high viewer ratings, but was also selected {{as one of the}} most popular Taiwanese dramas of 2014 by many of media review. Within a day of release, it reached over 24 million views on the mainland Chinese video sharing site iQiyi. Since its debut on July 19, the drama has stayed within the top two on iQiyi’s most popular dramas list.|$|E
25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were.</b> In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E
