A psychologist who spoke to Hari in relation to one of his trials, concluded that his success as an athlete and celebrity status, combined with a lack of personal guidance, has resulted in narcissistic personality traits. About his violent eruptions, Hari has said: [...] "I am able to explode at any moment. [...] When my brakes are off, it's just one big clump of explosion, chaos and noise, and I become blind to it all. [...] A storm, a hurricane, a disaster. [...] <b>There</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> a certain aggression inside of me, of which I don't know what to do with and neither where it comes from." [...] At his conviction on 21 February 2014, the district attorney described Hari as an individual who is very short-tempered, indulges in vulgar power display and demonstrates aggressive and intimidating behavior which is characterized by a high [...] "do-you-even-know-who-I-am caliber".|$|E

50|$|An ember {{is usually}} formed when a fire has only {{partially}} burnt {{a piece of}} fuel, {{and there is still}} usable chemical energy in that piece of fuel. Often this happens because the usable chemical energy is so deep into the center that air (specifically oxygen) does not reach it, therefore not causing combustion (carbon-based fuel + O2 → CO2 + H2O + C + other chemicals involved). It continues to stay hot and does not lose its thermal energy quickly because combustion is still happening at a low level. The small yellow, orange and red lights often seen among the embers are actually combustion. <b>There</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> not enough combustion happening at one time to create a flame. Once the embers are completely 'burned through', they are not carbon as is commonly believed (carbon burns, and is not normally left behind), but rather various other oxidized minerals like calcium and phosphorus. At that point they are normally called ashes. See: Wood ash for more on the residue that is left.|$|E

In fact, in real life economic competition does not exist in its pure form, but in a more realistic form instead: the monopolistic competition.

Here I offer both empirical and theoretical arguments against the permissibility of killing the one: firstly, I present data from my own empirical studies according to which the intuition that killing the one is permissible is neither widespread nor stable; secondly, I defend a normative principle according to which killing the one in Bystander at the Switch is not permissible. In conclusion, <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> no trolley problem...|$|E

40|$|Several {{competing}} {{human behavior}} {{models have been}} proposed to model and protect against boundedly rational adversaries in re-peated Stackelberg security games (SSGs). However, these existing models fail to address three main issues which are extremely detri-mental to defender performance. First, while they attempt to learn adversary behavior models from adversaries ’ past actions (“attacks on targets”), they fail {{to take into account}} adversaries ’ future adap-tation based on successes or failures of these past actions. Second, they assume that sufficient data in the initial rounds will lead to a reliable model of the adversary. However, our analysis reveals that the issue is not the amount of data, but that <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> not enough of the attack surface exposed to the adversary to learn a reliable model. Third, current leading approaches have failed to in-clude probability weighting functions, even though it is well know...|$|E
40|$|The term “connectome” is {{commonly}} taken {{to describe a}} complete map of neural connections in a nervous system of a given species. This chapter provides a critical perspective {{on the role of}} connectomes in neuroscientific practice and asks how the connectomic approach fits into a larger context in which network thinking permeates technology, infrastructure, social life, and the economy. In {{the first part of this}} chapter, we argue that, seen from the perspective of ongoing research, the notion of connectomes as “complete descriptions” is misguided. Our argument combines Rachel Ankeny's analysis of neuroanatomical wiring diagrams as “descriptive models” with Hans-Jörg Rheinberger's notion of “epistemic objects,” i. e., targets of research that are still partially unknown. Combining these aspects we conclude that connectomes are constitutively epistemic objects: <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> no way to turn them into permanent and complete technical standards because the possibilities to map connection properties under different modeling assumptions are potentially inexhaustible. In the second part of the chapter, we use this understanding of connectomes as constitutively epistemic objects in order to critically assess the historical and political dimensions of current neuroscientific research. We argue that connectomics shows how the notion of the “brain as a network” has become the dominant metaphor of contemporary brain research. We further point out that this metaphor shares (potentially problematic) affinities to the form of contemporary “network societies. ” We close by pointing out how the relation between connectomes and networks in society could be used in a more fruitful manner...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain a}} model for {{potential}} plasticity in the visual system of the chick we rotated one optic vesicle in embryos. The functionality of axonal connections was tested after hatching by examination of pecking behaviour, reflexes and the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). The animal exhibited normal reflexes with both eyes, showing the functionality of the manipulated eye. The animal showed to a monocular optokinetic stimulus – a normal OKN – a direction asymmetry in response to different stimulus velocities – a dependence in response to stimulus velocity – an increase in gain with decreasing stimulation velocity. In pecking behaviour the animal optimised the pecking precision in the first 5 days by maturation of the target mechanism and by learning. Plasticity on molecular level was examined by showing the expression pattern of positional marker in the tectum opticum (TO) by complementary connecting proteins. The expression of ephrin A 2 /A 5 was quantified in normal animals an those {{with one or two}} excised eye vesicles. Molecules were expressed in a gradient in a time frame between E 9 and E 15 in the TO. Thou enucleation of the eye anlage there was graded expression of ephrins between E 11 and E 15. The intensity of expression was influenced by the manipulation of the eye anlage. The results let us to the conclusion that on the molecular level the distribution patterns are mainly determined genetically and <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> a little influence by manipulation. On the behavioural level a higher amount of plasticity was shown...|$|E

40|$|There can {{be little}} {{question}} that {{we are living in}} a drug oriented society. The attendant problems of abuse are as widespread as the substances themselves, from the pill infested medicine chest to the ten year old Heroin addict. In the past several years not only the number of substances being abused, but also the number of people abusing substances, has increased dramatically. Law enforcement agencies and officials at all levels of government are continuing to significantly increase efforts to control the illicit supply of substances subject to abuse. Frequently these efforts can be key ingredients to successful community efforts. curtailment of supply often pressures the user towards rehabilitation and treatment programs, while removing the easy opportunity to experiment for many others [...] which gives our educational efforts time to be effective. In the past several years various modalities of educational and preventative efforts have been undertaken with varying degrees of success. While it is true that anyone playing with these substances should be scared, it is also apparent that fear alone is not sufficient {{to prevent the spread of}} Drug Abuse. It is also obvious that facts alone are not sufficient·, witness the anomaly of cigarette smokers sitting down to read the Surgeon General's report on how they are slowly killing themselves. Educational programs, utilizing special programs, assemblies, films and speakers all help, but they also are not sufficient. <b>There</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> no one easy answer, no instant solution. The problems of Drug Abuse are complex, often being referred to as Socio-Medical in nature. Most problems, complex or otherwise, are solved one step at a time. In this very limited sense the problems are similar to those faced by society in the past. There are more differences than similarities, and our response to the problems must take those differences into account if we hope to be successful. There is a clear and definite need for action. The addict must be treated, the experimenter or non user educated, and the seller prosecuted. In response to these needs and the fact that we can not afford unnecessary duplication, the Drug Abuse Authority has been created. It is essential that long range planning include well thought out comprehensive plans which effectively utilize local resources in such a manner as to insure continued viability of programs. It is our hope that these materials will serve as a guide to interested and involved citizens in establishing programs designed to meet the specific needs of their community. Specific information with regard to some local individuals to be contacted if you are now, or intend to be, involved in the field of drug abuse programming in Iowa, is listed in the appendices. These people are invaluable local resources that no one is in a position to ignore. There no city, no town and no family that is safe from the creeping cancer of Drug Abuse and we must communicate concerning problems and new ideas among ourselves if we are to have any chance of success...|$|E
