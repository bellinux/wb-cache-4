5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} significance of <b>these</b> <b>components</b> is defined {{not only by}} their structure or macronutrient category, {{but also by the}} physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E

5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on.

Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} {{also had}} problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around <b>these</b> <b>components.</b> The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E

5|$|Based on parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis, {{the most}} recent common {{ancestor}} of all eukaryotes most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; {{the absence of the}} pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic. This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer-like protein, one argonaute, one PIWI protein, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that may also have played other cellular roles. A large-scale comparative genomics study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic crown group already possessed <b>these</b> <b>components,</b> which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the exosome. This study also suggests that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as Aquifex aeolicus), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the translation initiation system.|$|E
