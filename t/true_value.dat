5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The <b>true</b> <b>value</b> of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E
5|$|After {{talks of}} closure for years, Wayzata Bay Center closed its doors on August 15, 2011. Demolition began shortly after in April 2012, when all {{stores in the}} mall had either {{relocated}} or closed. The Original Pancake House, a restaurant, was the final tenant to close in the mall. The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a tenant in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely. Among the mall's other final tenants were a <b>True</b> <b>Value</b> hardware store, a jewelry store, a health food store, and a furniture store.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their <b>true</b> <b>value,</b> but when Cora finds out their <b>true</b> <b>value,</b> she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E
30|$|Tables  4 and 5 {{present the}} summary {{results of the}} {{simulations}} based on 1000 repetitions under the given <b>true</b> <b>values.</b> In these tables, the first column shows {{the parameters of the}} model and second column shows the <b>true</b> <b>values</b> of the parameters. Tables  4 and  5 give the sample means of the MLEs of parameters obtained by the EM algorithm. For all of the sets, the sample means of the estimated parameters are close to the corresponding <b>true</b> <b>values</b> of the parameters. If the percent of censored observations decrease (i.e., if number of failures increase), the sample means of the MLEs become more closers to the <b>true</b> <b>values</b> for all most all sets, as expected. Similarly, the sample means of the MLEs become more closers to the <b>true</b> <b>values</b> for increasing sample sizes.|$|R

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the <b>true</b> <b>value</b> of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the <b>true</b> <b>value</b> of the króna.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1967, Wayzata Bay Center was {{constructed}} in two phases; the first phase was completed in 1964 while the second phase was completed in 1967.

5|$|The 1846Havana {{hurricane}} {{was likely}} of Category5 intensity, {{the earliest known}} tropical cyclone of its strength to strike Cuba. In 1993, the weather historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás analyzed an anomalous atmospheric pressure of 916mbar (27.06inHg) measured at Havana upon the vessel Thames, deeming it to be abnormally low and evaluating its <b>true</b> <b>value</b> {{to be closer to}} 938mbar (27.70inHg), making the hurricane the most intense in recorded history at the time. The exceptionally low pressure reading in Cuba surpassed a previous record of 948mbar (28.00inHg) set by an 1844storm, with the new record eventually exceeded by the 1924 Cuba hurricane, which featured a manually recorded pressure reading of 932mbar (27.52inHg).|$|E
5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the <b>true</b> <b>value</b> of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the coulomb {{force from}} the ambient {{electric}} field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to {{be attracted to}} the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called vacuum polarization. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its <b>true</b> <b>value,</b> and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron. This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator. Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for {{the mass of the}} electron.|$|E

The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect.
