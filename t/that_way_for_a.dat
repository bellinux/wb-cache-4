25|$|Hayashida {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} NES Remix should be completely authentic to its vintage roots. To this end, the compilation is based entirely on accurate emulation of the NES's hardware and on the original game software. This includes hardware glitches such as frame rate slowdown when too many characters are on the screen, and software bugs. Hayashida stated that these were intricate parts of the original and directly affect the difficulty {{and so they were}} not changed. Hayashida also spoke similarly about the controls; even if they were not considered ideal, he understood that they had been conceived <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reason and so they were unaltered for NES Remix.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? All that Heffy {{has found}} is a hut. He and Foxy will watch it. It's {{nothing to do}} with us; only we mustn't be seen <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit." ...|$|E
60|$|The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay {{waiting on}} the grass and daisies in the evening sun. Not a soul passed <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long while, and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} P {{systems with}} a linear membrane structure working on objects over a unary alphabet using sets of rules resembling homomorphisms. Such a restricted variant of P systems allows <b>for</b> <b>a</b> unique minimal {{representation of the}} generated unary language and in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> effective solution of the equivalence problem. Moreover, we examine the descriptional complexity of unary P systems {{with respect to the}} number of membranes...|$|R
60|$|Behind {{the mount}} the ground rose yet higher, {{ascending}} to a plantation which sheltered the house. The Baron strolled up here, and bent his gaze over the distance. The {{valley of the}} Exe lay before him, with its shining river, the brooks that fed it, and the trickling springs that fed the brooks. The situation of Margery's house was visible, though not the house itself; and the Baron gazed <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> infinitely long time, till, remembering himself, he moved on.|$|R
5000|$|The pig is justly named <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>for</b> it is <b>a</b> very dirty animal.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shouldn't {{take up a}} {{poor girl}} in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sharp word,--not when she is {{suffering}} as I am made to suffer. If you only think of it,--think what I have been expecting!" [...] And now Amelia began to cry, and to look {{as though she were}} going to fall into his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, mother," [...] cried Henry, entreatingly, [...] "don't {{stand up}} in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pirate; I can't bear to hear it. Did he not himself {{describe}} the pirate schooner's appearance in this room, {{and when he was}} attacked by the Talisman did he not shew out in his true colours, thereby proving that he is Durward the pirate?" ...|$|E
60|$|With {{that little}} Mrs. Peter hurried {{over to the}} tangle of vines from which all the voices seemed to come and eagerly peered this way and <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sight of her friends. But all she saw was a {{stranger}} wearing a very sober-colored suit. He was very polite {{and told her that}} he was an old friend of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
60|$|Once {{we heard}} shots in front; {{then there was}} a long wait. As we trudged on we passed something--some things--lying by the wayside. During another wait we {{examined}} them, curiously lifting the blankets from their yellow-clay faces. How repulsive they looked with their blood-smears, their blank, staring eyes, their teeth uncovered by contraction of the lips! The frost had begun already to whiten their deranged clothing. We were as patriotic as ever, but we did not wish to be <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>For</b> <b>an</b> hour afterward the injunction of silence in the ranks was needless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lass, <b>that's</b> no <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman," [...] said Wade, {{and there}} was {{something}} in his kind tone, in his look, in his presence, that calmed Columbine. [...] "I'll look after Moore. You go get some water an' a towel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wanting a wife--ay, as {{he would}} want a housekeeper, just because {{he has got to}} the proper {{position}} for it; but is he to go and get our bonny Mary in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> just <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appendage to the mastership?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{tell when}} he 's {{going to get}} those spells," [...] 'Frisco Kid explained, when Joe, having {{finished}} washing dishes, came on deck. [...] "Sometimes he won't get <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month, and others he won't be decent for {{a week at a}} stretch. Sometimes he 's good-natured, and sometimes he 's dangerous; so {{the best thing to do}} is to let him alone and keep out of his way; and don't cross him, for if you do there 's liable to be trouble.|$|E
60|$|Barnet {{decided to}} allow them a proper time to themselves, and then stroll down to the shore and drive them home. After {{lingering}} on at the house for another hour he started with this intention. A few hundred yards below 'Chateau Ringdale' stood the cottage in which the late lieutenant's daughter had her lodging. Barnet {{had not been so}} far <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, and as he approached the forbidden ground a curious warmth passed into him, which led him to perceive that, unless he were careful, he might have to fight the battle with himself about Lucy over again. A tenth of his present excuse would, however, have justified him in travelling by that road to-day.|$|E
60|$|As he ran, Reddy watched sharply {{this way}} and <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place to hide the fat hen. He knew he must find a place soon, because already that fat hen was growing very heavy. Presently he spied the hollow stump of a tree. He didn't know it was hollow {{when he first saw}} it, but from its looks he thought it might be. The top of it was only about two feet above the ground. Reddy stopped and stood up on his hind legs so as to see if the top of that stump was hollow. It was. With a quick look {{this way and}} that way to make sure he wasn't seen, he tossed the fat hen over into the hollow and then, with a sigh of relief, darted away.|$|E
50|$|Typical ram {{actuator}} assemblies (operator systems) are {{secured to}} the BOP housing by removable bonnets. Unbolting the bonnets from the housing allows BOP maintenance and facilitates {{the substitution of}} rams. In <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>for</b> example, <b>a</b> pipe ram BOP {{can be converted to}} a blind shear ram BOP.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the Robinson's-May {{store at}} the mall closed down. Other tenants around it {{at the north end}} of the mall had also left, leaving that part of the mall empty with many vacant spaces. It {{remained}} <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> over <b>a</b> year until 2007, when it was announced a new 2-story Target store would occupy the anchor space.|$|R
60|$|My bed was a {{thin and}} rotten tick of straw spread on the cell floor. One thin and filthy blanket {{constituted}} the covering. There was no chair, no table--nothing but the tick of straw and the thin, aged blanket. I was ever a short sleeper and ever a busy-brained man. In solitary one grows sick of oneself in his thoughts, {{and the only way}} to escape oneself is to sleep. For years I had averaged five hours' sleep a night. I now cultivated sleep. I made a science of it. I became able to sleep ten hours, then twelve hours, and, at last, as high as fourteen and fifteen hours out of the twenty-four. But beyond that I could not go, and, perforce, was compelled to lie awake and think and think. And <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> active-brained man, lay madness.|$|R
60|$|Meantime Sir Launcelot rode {{forward at}} a slow pass and in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great distance. So, at last, still riding in the cart, they came of a sudden {{out of the forest}} and into a little fertile valley in the midst of which lay a small town and a fair castle with seven towers that {{overlooked}} the town. And this was a very fair pretty valley, for on all sides of the town and of the castle were fields of growing corn, all green and lush, and there were many hedgerows and orchards of fruit-trees all abloom with fragrant blossoms. And the sound of cocks crowing came to Sir Launcelot upon a soft breeze that blew up the valley, and on the same breeze came the fragrance of apple blossoms, wherefore it seemed to Sir Launcelot that this valley was like a fair jewel of heaven set in the rough perlieus of the forest that lay round about.|$|E
6000|$|... "But Ebbo is not shouting. Oh, mother, he is vexed--he is hurt!" [...] cried Friedel, {{springing}} {{from her}} lap; but, ere either {{could reach the}} window, Ebbo had vanished from the scene. They only saw the young wolf stretched dead on the snow, and the same moment in burst Ebbo, and flung himself {{on the floor in}} a passion of weeping. Stimulated by the applause of his grandmother and of Matz, he had furiously pelted the poor animal with all missiles that came to hand, till a blow, either from him or Matz, had produced such a howl and struggle of agony, and then such terrible stillness, as had gone to the young Baron's very heart, a heart as soft as that of his father had been by nature. Indeed, his sobs were so piteous that his mother was relieved to hear only, [...] "The wolf! the poor wolf!" [...] and to find that he himself was unhurt; and she was scarcely satisfied of this when Dame Kunigunde came up also alarmed, and thus turned his grief to wrath. [...] "As if I would cry in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bite!" [...] he said. [...] "Go, grandame; you made me do it, the poor beast!" [...] with a fresh sob.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nickname}} [...] "Plwacz" [...] (the Spitter) {{was already}} {{given to him}} in the 13th century chronicles. It's unknown if he was named in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> disease who affected his throat or because he had bad manners. Another nickname used in the contemporary sources was [...] "Odonic", a corruption of his patronymic Odowic ("son of Odon"); here is also unknown why the sources persisted in the erroneus form instead of using the correct.|$|E
50|$|Aoun and Geagea {{kicked off}} talks a year ago. The talks {{culminated in a}} Declaration of Intent <b>that</b> paved the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{surprise}} visit by Geagea to Aoun's residence in Rabieh in June.|$|R
5000|$|Friday and Gannon {{arrive at}} an {{apartment}} building and get a key to Benjie's apartment from the manager. Inside they find Benjie's friend, Phillip Jameson, and lots of drugs. Benjie {{is on the other}} side of the room motionless, having been <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> about <b>an</b> hour, and after telling Phillip he wanted to [...] "get further out". Friday checks his pulse and declares, [...] "Well, he made it. He's dead".|$|R
50|$|As a lawmaker, Gormley crafted {{legislation}} <b>that</b> {{paved the}} <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> development renaissance in Atlantic City. He also holds the rare distinction of having authored and secured approval for two {{amendments to the}} New Jersey state constitution.|$|R
5000|$|This was Stephens' fifth {{recording}} as leader. The {{other musicians}} are pianist Brad Mehldau, guitarist Julian Lage, bassist Larry Grenadier, and drummer Eric Harland. The tracks are mostly ballads. The title track [...] "launches with Stephens blowing breathy, Mehldau filling in spaces gingerly, Harland brushing breezily. It stays <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good {{couple of minutes}} until Mehldau finds an opening; Stephens, not one to spoil the mood, takes the cue and maintains the hush." ...|$|E
50|$|Bibio femoratus is a {{slow and}} clumsy flier and is usually found a couple feet off the ground. They can be {{observed}} tumbling around and flailing their legs {{in an effort to}} right themselves. After synchronous emergence, Bibio femoratus forms large swarms of mating pairs. The mating pairs are joined at the abdomen and stay <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. They seem oblivious and unaware of humans as a threat, and will not make any efforts to avoid sudden movements or threatening gestures.|$|E
5000|$|Raphaël Géminiani said: [...] "Darrigade was the {{greatest}} French sprinter of all time and he'll stay <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. The mould has been broken. But he wasn't just a sprinter. He was an animateur who could start decisive breaks; he destroyed the image of sprinters who just sit on wheels." [...] He began his sprints from a long distance from the line, challenging others to pass him. It endeared him to the French public, said de Latour.|$|E
50|$|He states <b>that</b> {{the only}} <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bird to ascend when in <b>a</b> {{tailwind}} is <b>for</b> the bird, {{at its peak}} ascent, to turn in a semicircle and face the wind to continue its ascension in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|Writing {{based on}} Latin graphemes was {{introduced}} in 1932 (an alphabet book and arithmetic textbook were published). Teaching from the alphabet book of 1932 (authored by ethnographer Elizabeth Porfirevna Orlova and co-produced {{by a group of}} Itelmen students) lasted several years; but after alphabets for [...] "Northern" [...] languages were transformed into Cyrillic {{at the end of the}} 1930s, Itelmen writing was abolished. Itelmen became an unwritten language and remained <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> almost <b>a</b> half century.|$|R
50|$|In November 1990, the Folketing {{passed a}} law <b>that</b> paved the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{nationwide}} Danish telecom. The company was named Tele Danmark and was the parent company for the existing regional companies (KTAS, Jydsk Telefon, Tele Sønderjylland, Fyns Telefon, and Rigstelefonen).|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} racing team, {{sponsors}} {{have been important}} to keep teams running. Miss Madison has had many title sponsors through the years. Many {{of them have been}} large companies. The boat, racing under the official number U-6, started out as just the Miss Madison and remained <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very long time. Sponsorships became {{a big part of the}} team after 1988 when the new hull was beginning its racing career. Miss Madison has been sponsored by Mazda, Holset, Kelloggs Frosted Flakes, Jasper Engines and Transmissions, DeWalt Tools, Oberto Sausage Company. HomeStreet Bank begins sponsorship starting in 2016.|$|E

5000|$|The news {{programming}} of SBT was <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{few years}} until the network decide to re-invest {{in the area}} in 2005, after contracting Ana Paula Padrão, which was anchor on Rede Globo. Thus, in August of the same year, Padrão began to anchor the newcast of the network, SBT Brasil. Besides Ana Paula Padrão newscast, new news programs joined the SBT schedule in the following years, as the Jornal do SBT Manhã, SBT Realidade, Boletim de Ocorrências, and finally the Conexão Repórter. [...] The network also had attempts of new non-durable formats such as SBT Notícias Breves, a new version of Aqui Agora, and more recently the SBT Notícias.|$|E

50|$|In 1887 the {{architect}} Mariano Belmas directed works that were undertaken to aesthetically standardize the building, especially {{an important part}} of the façade which had been left unfinished. the interior was already compartmentalized to accommodate office use by the twentieth century until they were later closed, remaining <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> over <b>a</b> decade, severely deteriorated.
