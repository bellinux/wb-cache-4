It argues that linguists {{will benefit from}} taking a multidisciplinary approach, and that by drawing on theory and research in other disciplines, especially in social psychology, they will gain a clearer and deeper understanding of face. The paper starts by examining selected theories of identity, focusing in particular on Simon's (2004) self-respect model of identity and Brewer and Gardner's (1996) theory of levels of identity. Key features from these theories are then applied to <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> analysis of face.

40|$|We {{describe}} some experiments which {{simulate a}} grounded approach to language acquisition {{in which a}} population of autonomous agents without prior linguistic knowledge tries to construct {{at the same time}} a conceptualisation of its environment and a shared language. <b>The</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> language acquisition processes in each individual agent are based on general purpose cognitive capacities, such as categorisation, discrimination, evaluation and induction. The emergence of a shared language in the population results from a process of selforganisation of a particular type of linguistic interaction which takes place among the agents in the population. The experiments, which extend previous work by addressing the problem of the acquisition of both the semantics and the syntax of propositional logic, show that at the end of the simulation runs the agents build different <b>conceptualisations</b> <b>and</b> different grammars. However, these <b>conceptualisations</b> <b>and</b> grammars are compatible enough to guarantee the unambiguous communication of propositional logic sentences. Furthermore the categorisers of the perceptually grounded and logical categories built during <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> language acquisition processes can be used for some forms of common sense reasoning, such as determining whether a sentence is a tautology, a contradiction, a common sense axiom or a merely satisfiable formula.

To understand these changes, this chapter will provide an exploration of <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> creation of an interactive, online, social network community of practice. The case {{that will be used}} is based around the Distance Education Hub (DEHub) which is both virtual and physical. DEHub is in the simultaneous process of constructing and facilitating a virtual space to support and encourage both knowledge dissemination and knowledge creation. The DEHub space focuses on learning as a cooperative, constructive, and dynamic process involving engaged communities of scholars, learners and practitioners.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the need to revise <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> {{measurement}} of evaluative style in future Reliance on Accounting Performance Measures (RAPM) research. Based on a review of the existing literature, we identify a number of issues in <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> measurement of evaluative style and conclude that none of the existing measures is ideal for use in future research. We see two general dimensions of evaluative style that need specific attention in future research. The first dimension addresses the evaluative focus of the superior (e. g. budgets, other quantitative targets, short or long-term targets, etc.). The second dimension addresses the superior’s way of handling the evaluation process (e. g. rigid or flexible, fixing blame, using it as a learning opportunity, etc.). Building on these two dimensions, there i a need for studies that assess how specific performance measures are used in different way within a particular organisational context, enabling a distinction between the design and the use of control tools. These conclusions suggest a need for qualitative indepth field studies within single organisations rather than quantitative survey research across organisations in future research on evaluative style and its behavioural consequences.

40|$|Problem Employer {{branding}} as {{a strategy}} {{to attract and retain}} employees (Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004) is continuously gaining more popularity among practitioners <b>and</b> academics. However, <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> implementation of employer branding in specific contexts is overlooked in the literature (Aggerholm, Andersen & Thomsen, 2011). Purpose The purpose of the study is to show how employer branding is influenced by the context in which companies operate. The focus of the study regarding the context has been the values and norms of the Greek society and the current financial crisis. Method A qualitative research has been carried out in which data from interviews and a questionnaire of Human Resources professionals in Greece, corporate websites, and material from mass media have been analysed. Data triangulation has been selected to increase the trustworthiness of the study’s findings. Conclusion <b>The</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> practice of employer branding are influenced by the context in which companies operate. The companies that implement employer branding in Greece during the financial crisis have as a goal to reduce its effects on their working environments, their brands, and the collaboration with their suppliers. Therefore, the goal of employer branding becomes to increase the employee engagement and to improve the corporate reputation. In order to achieve their goals, the organisational actors mobilise the societal-level principles, values and beliefs appropriate to communicate the employer brand to key stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{differentiate}} the production process within services from the dominant manufacturing-based production process, with the objective of delineating the production process in services and highlighting its implication for service productivity. Design/methodology/approach – This study critically reviewed the extant literature on the production processes in manufacturing and services from a multidisciplinary perspective and proposed a framework for the service production process and its relationship with service productivity. Findings – The production process for services differs from the dominant manufacturing-based production process and entails an input, transformation process and outcome dimensions. Therefore, any advancement in services, particularly <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> measurement of service productivity, is dependent on the application of a service-specific production process. Research limitations/implications – The understanding and delineation of the production process in services would further scholarly understanding of what is means to be productive in services and the impact on the validity of <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> measurement of service productivity and other service-related concepts. Practical implications – The proposed service-based production process can further managerial understanding of the measurement and management of productivity in services. Originality/value – This paper delineates the production process in services and highlighted its implication for service productivity. This study, therefore, is a step forward in developing service-specific concepts and measures, particularly service productivity...|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{great deal}} of {{academic}} debate surrounding the term ‘restorative justice’, it would appear fair to suggest {{that the majority of the}} research in this area focuses upon the three main stakeholders involved within the process, namely the victim, the offender and the community, victim-offender mediation, and the benefits of such an approach. Nonetheless, not only can this can be seen to neglect a number of restorative justice processes, but also to underestimate the role of the facilitator. Considering how restorative justice has been increasingly embraced by criminal justice agencies in the past 30 years, this study sets out to examine how <b>the</b> ground-level <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> delivery of restorative justice by the Police Service relates to academic perspectives, policing policies and wider penological shifts. In turn, it will be argued, evidenced by analysis of research data derived from eight semi-structured interviews with operational front-line policing staff, that although <b>the</b> <b>conceptualisation</b> <b>and</b> delivery of restorative justice is influenced by all of these factors, primarily they channel into policing policies and individual discretion, which have the most direct effect on practice...|$|R
