5|$|Cortana's {{original}} design {{was based on}} the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's holographic representation always <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman. Bungie first introduced Cortana—and Halo—through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, and her holographic representation has been noted for its sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant.|$|E

5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E
5|$|It is the 1st Joker Card of the 1st Deck in the Dark Carnival mythology. Recording {{sessions}} for the album took place from 1991 to 1992 at Miller Midi Productions and The Tempermill Studio. The album {{is the first}} Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics describe the Carnival of Carnage as {{a representation of the}} violence that occurs within the ghettos, which <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traveling carnival to enact the same brutality on the upper class.|$|E
5|$|The Eskayan {{writing system}} <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> syllabary of over 1,000 characters, all modeled on {{parts of the}} human body {{including}} internal organs. This unique script has been compared variously to Phoenician, Etruscan, Hebrew, and even the undeciphered script of the Butuan paleograph. While there are no mother-tongue speakers of Eskayan, it is taught to both adults and children in volunteer-run cultural schools. The Eskayan language and script has been the object of ongoing controversy.|$|E

5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them. It <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who have ignored the inner cities' cries for help. The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork {{for the rest of the}} albums in the Joker's Cards series.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E

5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete metamorphosis. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triungulin.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
5|$|Each {{season of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall theme episodes tie into. Roz Kaveney identifies family and belonging as the overall {{theme of the}} fifth season. Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) begins experiencing headaches {{at the beginning of}} the season, once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which Buffy finds at the end of that episode. The fifth season also introduces Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's 14-year-old sister. Each season has a primary antagonist called the Big Bad; in the fifth season this <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> powerful goddess named Glory (Clare Kramer).|$|E

5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune who <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human woman. The kitsune {{may be a}} seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes {{as if from a}} dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The 13th-century Lady Chapel {{contains}} the stone shrine of SaintWerburgh which {{dates from the}} 14thcentury and which used to contain her relics. The shrine, of similar red sandstone as the cathedral, has a base pierced with deep niches. The upper part <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> miniature chapel containing statuettes. During {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries it was dismantled. Some of the parts were found during the 1873 restoration of the cathedral and the shrine was reassembled in 1888 by Blomfield. A carving of StWerburgh by Joseph Pyrz was added in 1993. Also in the chapel are a sedilia and a piscina. The stained glass of 1859, is by William Wailes. The chapel contains a monument to Archdeacon Francis Wrangham, made by Hardman & Co. and dating from 1846. In 1555, George Marsh, Martyr stood trial here accused of heresy.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner. It <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge. The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Tuscan {{column of}} Purbeck Marble construction, on which stands {{a statue of}} Saint George slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture and approached several artists but all quotes she received would have exceeded the village's budget, so she instead commissioned {{a copy of a}} statue in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The column stands on a tall, narrow pedestal in Portland stone that bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by Robert Bridges, the poet laureate, in correspondence with Lady Horner. A cross is engraved immediately above.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> marble column {{topped by}} a sculpture of Saint George slaying a dragon, an image Lutyens used on two other public war memorials. At {{the base of the}} column, the names of the village's war dead are inscribed on stone panels. The memorial is flanked by identical rubble walls in local stone, on top of which grows a yew hedge. Low stone benches protrude from the walls to allow wreaths to be laid. Additional panels were fixed to the wall after the Second World War to commemorate that conflict. The memorial was unveiled on 26 June 1921 by Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, whose brother is among those commemorated on it. It is a grade II* listed building and since 2015 has been part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.|$|E
