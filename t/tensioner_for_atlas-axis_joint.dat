5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the <b>atlas–axis</b> <b>joint</b> (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|R

50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} serves double duty: moving the chain between rear sprockets and taking up chain slack caused by {{moving to a}} smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned {{in the path of}} the bottom, slack portion of chain. Sometimes the rear-derailleurs are re-purposed as chain <b>tensioners</b> <b>for</b> single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust chain tension by a different method.|$|R

50|$|Most {{motorcycles}} of {{this period}} tensioned the primary chain by drawing or rotating the gearbox backwards on a hinge with threaded rods, this was known as pre-unit construction. The first A7 had a fixed gearbox, bolted {{to the back of}} the crankcase, and an internal <b>tensioner</b> <b>for</b> the duplex primary chain. This gave it the appearance of unit construction and pioneered the system later used in unit-construction engines such as the BSA C15, BSA B40, Triumph 3TA and so on. However, in 1954 a re-design reverted to the older system. The electrics (as was universal for larger British motorcycles of the period) consisted of two independent systems, the very reliable and self-contained Lucas magneto, with a dynamo generator to charge the battery and provide lights. Carburation was a single Amal remote float Type 6 until 1955 when it was upgraded to a 376 Monobloc.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automatic belt <b>tensioner</b> <b>for</b> {{stabilization}} of Engine accessory belt system is made increase its life, decrease {{noise and vibration}} and increase its commercial value. Therefore, it is important finding test mode to assess life of automatic belt tensioner. However, measurement and analysis test result in practical test condition on real road needs requiring much test time and finance. In this study, there is analyzed and established test mode which is loaded measured equivalent damage in real working condition, compared test condition of pre-established test mode and FTP- 75 mode of fuel efficiency test and verified {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each mode. Because FTP- 75 Mode is for measuring fuel efficiency related with engine, applying FTP- 75 mode is estimated suitability for test of engine accessory. Comparison and assessment of damage is investigated structure and pulley part. Equivalent damage is calculated with Palmgren-Miner Rule and representative stress method, test condition of automatic belt tensioner is investigated. This investigation is regarded as being useful to life evaluation of both automatic belt tensioner and other engine accessory component...|$|R
40|$|The master {{thesis is}} focused on an {{evaluation}} of a preload lost in a tappered joint. The analyzed bolts are preloaded by a hydraulic tensioner. When the tensioner is removed, the joint is established and the preload in bolt is decreased. The analysisis carried out on axisymmetry model of joint in ANSYS Workbench 15, a finite element method is implemented in that software. The evaluation of the preload lost is made for a used range of ratio of clamped length to a nominal diameter of bolt. Geometry and material assumptions are defined. Before preloading of bolts to a desired value the process of stabilization preloading must be done otherwise outlines of the analysis are not applicable. On {{the base of the}} outlines of the analysis, the method for analytical computing of the desired pretension is done. The method involves the preload lost, which occurs due to establishment of the joint. The strength assesment of the hydraulic <b>tensioner</b> <b>for</b> bolts M 72 x 4 is done. A 3 D model of the tensioner with one plane of symmetry was used. Strength criteria for maximum allowed linear-elastic stress are in accordance with ČSN EN 13 445 - 3...|$|R

A first experimental study with deflection imposed on the tensioner is carried out to identify hysteresis loop parameters for the two models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} choosing the most appropriate contact model from several models, by comparing their efficiency for predicting hysteretic behaviour in different applications. The first part describes an application <b>for</b> a belt <b>tensioner</b> used <b>for</b> automotive engines. The second part concerns an academic application and focuses on a simple case of vibration {{in the presence of}} dry friction. The hysteresis loops obtained at contact locations are usually used to reproduce the nonlinear forces transmitted along the contact surface as accurately as possible. Although such techniques can be used when the contact zone is easily accessible, this is not generally possible for real, complex structures. Consequently, different techniques are developed and validated...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the digital {{universe}} has grown exponentially, the common use of the Internet {{has led to a}} new way to generate and consume information, only 10 years ago, it was necessary a deployment of technological infrastructure a lot expensive in order to collect data from several areas, they are ranging from a simple market analysis to the most specialized scientific research in complex areas such as medicine, physics, astronomy etc. But because of the maturity of the information age, costs are down, access to information is available or can be generated from low-cost devices giving rise to Bigdata. This opens doors to a new world of opportunities such as image processing and possible both commercial and scientific applications. Clear examples of current commercial solutions such as image recognition for security systems of vehicles in circulation or current investigations as automatic driving or detection of diseases from images of organs of patients obtained by scanners. This thesis deals the problem of the processing and classification of images in categories, obtained from any data source, using for this approach Deep-Learning. For this we have implemented a convolutional neural network architecture based on Java. Composed of an ETL module that handles the loading of images in raw format and transforms into <b>tensioners</b> <b>for</b> treatment within ConvNet, the configuration of the convolutional network is made up of 12 layers, 6 convolutional layers and 5 MaxPooling layers, together with a fully-connected layer. The convolutional layers were configured with Relu as activation function, while the last layer that performs the classification was treated with Softmax function. The application works in two ways developed stand alone and distributed, in both cases the framework used for the development of this thesis was Deeplearning 4 j which is based on java, for the development of convolutional networks. In addition to handling n-dimensional array, linear algebra and signal processing functions NDj 4 were used which is a scientific computing libraries for Java that complements the aforementioned framework. For the distributed environment Apache Spark was used as a distributed cluster, and RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) for the distribution model over the nodes that form the Spark cluster. The results obtained from the experiments were different depending on the parameters supplied, these ranged from 60 to 80 of accuracy. The duration of the training process model in stand alone mode take considerable time unlike the distributed (minutes vs. hours). For future work this project could be coupled to any other system performing object recognition, especially if they are developed in Java thus being a multiplatform solution...|$|R
50|$|Given this, and {{the lack}} of funds to develop an all-new power unit, it was decided to upgrade the A-Series unit at a cost of £30 million. The result was the 'A-Plus' Series of engines. Available in 998cc and 1275cc, the A-Plus had {{stronger}} engine blocks and cranks, lighter pistons and improved piston rings, Spring loaded <b>tensioner</b> units <b>for</b> the timing chain and other detail changes to increase the service interval of the engine (from 6,000 to 12,000 miles). More modern SU carburettors and revised manifold designs allowed for small improvements in power without any decrease in torque or fuel economy. Many of the improvements learnt from the Cooper-tuned units were also incorporated, with A-Plus engines having a generally higher standard of metallurgy on all units, where previously only the highest-tuned engines were upgraded in this way. This made the A-Plus engines generally longer-lived than the standard A-Series, which had a life between major rebuilds of around 80,000 to 100,000 miles in normal service. Studies were made into upgrading the engine to use five main crankshaft bearings but the standard three-bearing crank had proven reliable even in high states of tune and at high engines speeds, so it was not deemed worth the extra funding.|$|R
5000|$|Grommets {{are used}} to {{reinforce}} holes in leather, cloth, shoes, canvas and other fabrics. They can be made of metal, rubber, or plastic, and are easily used in common projects, requiring only the grommet itself and a means of setting it with a punch, a metal rod with a [...] tip. A simple punch, often sold with the grommets, can be struck with a hammer to set the grommet. It can also be set with an electronic, pneumatic, or gas-powered machine. There are also dedicated grommet presses with punch and anvil, {{as shown in the}} picture, ranging from inexpensive to better-quality tools, which are somewhat faster to use. They {{are used to}} strengthen holes; in footwear for boot and shoe laces, in laced clothing such as corsets, and in curtains and other household items that require hanging from hooks, as when they are used in conjunction with <b>tensioner</b> rods <b>for</b> shower curtains. The grommet prevents the cord from tearing through the hole, thereby providing structural integrity. Small grommets are also called eyelets, especially when used in clothing or crafting. Eyelets may be used purely decoratively for crafting. When used in sailing and various other applications they are called cringles. Sometimes field workers may refer to them as grunyons.|$|R
40|$|Static {{structural}} {{analysis of a}} pipe during laying is usually performed by use of finite element analysis tools specialized for this purpose. In this paper, Abaqus/CAE, which is a general purpose FEA software, was used for a static non-linear {{structural analysis}} of a pipe during pipe laying. The pipe is modeled as a geometrically non-linear elastic beam supported by a vessel and its stinger in the overbend region and by the seabed in the sagbend region. We propose a new method <b>for</b> <b>tensioner</b> modeling based on friction contacts between the pipe and the tensioner. Contact interactions between the pipe and rollers, {{as well as between}} the pipe and the seabed, are also considered. Basic static analysis is enhanced with floating stinger implementation, a non-flat seabed profile and buoyancy tanks application. The model results for various test cases of pipe laying are compared with an industry standard pipe laying modeling tool...|$|R
5000|$|Dirt jumping, {{urban and}} street {{mountain}} bikes lie {{somewhere in between}} a BMX bike and a freeride bike. They are either arranged as rigid or hardtail bikes, with 3 to 4.5 in of front suspension, and rigid, durable frames with low bottom brackets and short chainstays to improve maneuverability. Dirt Jump bikes often overlap in design with Four-Cross bikes, though that discipline has largely fallen out of favor, with many frames including removable derailleur hangers and/or integrated chain <b>tensioners</b> to allow <b>for</b> single speed and multi-speed arrangements (Four-Cross bikes mostly use derailleurs while Dirt Jumpers usually use single speed setups). Tires on these bikes are usually 24 or 26" [...] diameter, fast-rolling slicks or semi-slicks, with narrow casings (approx. 1.8-2.2"). Dirt jumpers usually have low seatposts and oversized handlebars, {{to make room for}} tricks. Most dirt jumpers have an extended rear brake cable installed and have no front brake, which allows the rider to spin the handle bars multiple times without tangling the brake cables.|$|R
2500|$|The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, {{but there}} was still room for improvements. In 1962 the {{slightly}} altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine. This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic <b>tensioner</b> unit <b>for</b> the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life. [...] The 10J engine was also adapted into a marine engine by Mercury of the USA and sold under the Mercruiser 165 name.|$|R
