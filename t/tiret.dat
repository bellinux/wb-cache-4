5000|$|Also {{buried in}} the chapel are King Henry IV and his second wife, Joan of Navarre, Queen of England. Henry's tomb is {{on the north side}} of Trinity Chapel, next to the shrine of St Thomas Becket. It was unusual for a King of England not to be buried at Westminster Abbey, but Becket's cult was then at its height, as {{evidenced}} in the Canterbury Tales, and Henry seemed particularly devoted to it, or at least keen to be associated with it. Reasons for his interment in Canterbury are debatable, but it is highly likely that Henry deliberately associated himself with the martyred saint for reasons of political expediency, namely, the legitimation of his dynasty after seizing the throne from his cousin, Richard II. [...] Significantly, at his coronation, he was anointed with holy oil which was said to have been given to Becket by the Virgin Mary shortly before his death in 1170; this oil was placed inside a distinct eagle-shaped container of gold.

The counterpart of this technique is the prolonged postoperative ventilatory depression which re-quires the institution of artificial ventilation for several hours. It is generally considered that nasal tracheal tubes are tolerated better than oral in these circumstances, and this belief explains why, in about 50 % of all the patients undergoing open heart surgery in France, the nasal route was used during anaesthesia and in the postoperative period (Depoix, Desmonts and <b>Tiret,</b> 1984). However, specific complications related to the nasal route have been reported: nasal bleeding and post-intubation nasal discomfort (Fletcher et al., 1984), {{a higher incidence of}} bacteraemia (Berry, Blanken-baker and Ball, 1973) and acute maxillary sinusiti...|$|E
30|$|Angiotensin II (Ang II) is {{a potent}} {{vasoactive}} and fibrogenic peptide. It is derived from conversion of Ang I by the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme encoded by the ACE gene (MIM 106180). The gene coding for ACE has two promoter sites that code for two major isoforms, somatic ACE (sACE) and testis ACE (tACE) (Testut et al. 1993). Variations in the ACE gene, many of which influence levels of the protein, are associated with diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer’s disease, major depression, type II diabetes, and various quantitative precursors of these disorders (Rigat et al. 1990; <b>Tiret</b> et al. 1992; Villard et al. 1996; Daniel et al. 2006; Kehoe et al. 2003; Hadjadj et al. 2007). One {{of the most important}} and widely studied variations in ACE is a 287 -base pair (bp) Alu insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron 16 (rs 4340). The D allele was found to raise ACE plasma levels in Europeans (McKenzie et al. 1995; Rigat et al. 1990; <b>Tiret</b> et al. 1992). A large number of studies have found significant associations of the I/D polymorphism with different pathophysiological conditions (Ueda et al. 1995; Murphey et al. 2000; Giner et al. 2000), not all of which were confirmed in replicate studies (Lachurie et al. 1995; Jeunemaitre et al. 1992; Schmidt et al. 1993). Other polymorphisms 5 ′ to the I/D locus were identified and found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the I/D locus (Soubrier et al. 2002). There are strong indications that the impact of the ACE gene on cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases is through the joint—not individual—effect of alleles at the various polymorphic loci in this gene (Keavney et al. 1998; Villard et al. 1996; Zhu et al. 2000, 2001; McKenzie et al. 2001; Cox et al. 2002). Therefore, haplotype-based association studies have been recommended (Soubrier et al. 2002; Sayed-Tabatabaei et al. 2006). A total of 52 haplotypes were identified by resequencing ACE in Europeans and African-Americans with high divergence in respect of haplotypes and their frequencies (Rieder et al. 1999). There is however a paucity of systematic studies on {{the nature and extent of}} haplotype diversity across populations, and on inferring selective pressures and evolution of the ACE gene. In this study, we examine global frequency profiles of haplotypes reconstructed from nine polymorphic loci in the ACE gene, including in 15 ethnic populations of India for which data have been generated by us refine existing models pertaining to the evolution of ACE haplotypes and draw inferences on selective forces that may have acted to maintain these haplotypes and their frequencies.|$|E
40|$|Together with {{interstellar}} turbulence, gravitation is one {{key player}} in star formation. It acts both at galactic scales in the assembly of gas into dense clouds, and inside those structures for their collapse {{and the formation of}} pre-stellar cores. To understand to what extent the large scale dynamics govern the star formation activity of galaxies, we present hydrodynamical simulations in which we generalise the behaviour of gravity to make it differ from Newtonian dynamics in the low acceleration regime. We focus on the extreme cases of interacting galaxies, and compare the evolution of galaxy pairs in the dark matter paradigm to that in the Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) framework. Following up on the seminal work by <b>Tiret</b> & Combes, this paper documents the first simulations of galaxy encounters in MOND with a detailed Eulerian hydrodynamical treatment of baryonic physics, including star formation and stellar feedback. We show that similar morphologies of the interacting systems can be produced by both the dark matter and MOND formalisms, but require a much slower orbital velocity in the MOND case. Furthermore, we find that the star formation activity and history are significantly more extended in space and time in MOND interactions, in particular in the tidal debris. Such differences could be used as observational diagnostics and make interacting galaxies prime objects {{in the study of the}} nature of gravitation at galactic scales. Comment: MNRAS in pres...|$|E
40|$|Title: Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Genetic Association with Multiple Correlated Phenotypes. Authors: Alex Lewin (1), Habib Saadi (1), Leonardo Bottolo (1), Sylvia Richardson (2) (1 : Imperial College, London, 2 : MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge) Abstract: Genetic {{association}} {{studies are}} used to find regions of the genome associated with phenotypes of interest. Most association studies to date {{have been carried out}} for a single phenotype, or for small combination of phenotypes, with a single regression being performed for each marker. Here we study a data set in which the phenotypes are 137 metabolites measured by NMR in a birth cohort of 4000 people. The genetic associations with these phenotypes have been analysed previously one at a time, ie separate regressions have been done for each marker x phenotype combination (Tukiainen et al. 2012). Rather than carrying out thousands of separate univariate analyses, we model all the data simultaneously. We use the Bayesian model HESS (Hierarchical Evolutionary Stochastic Search) developed by Bottolo et al. 2011, for detecting genetic regulation of gene expression, in particular for finding genetic markers which are associated with multiple expression phenotypes. The hierarchical formulation incorporates a regression model for each phenotype against all the genetic markers, with a sparsity prior to induce variable selection amongst the markers. The Bayesian hierarchical model treats the multiple phenotypes in parallel, enabling information sharing across phenotypes, whilst allowing for different markers to be associated with different phenotypes. The data set used here exhibits a strong correlation structure between the phenotypes, linked to their related biological function. In this work we investigate the performance of the hierarchical model for analysing correlated outcomes, discuss a range of analysis strategy where the correlation of the phenotypes is exploited, and develop methods for assessing statistical importance of selected markers in the presence of correlated data.
