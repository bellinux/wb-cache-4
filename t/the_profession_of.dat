5|$|Turkey {{has adopted}} the {{principle}} of the separation of powers. In line with this principle, judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation. The independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors, <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>of</b> judges and prosecutors, the supervision of judges and public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the Turkish Constitution.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, the {{old order}} was mostly re-established as {{fourteen}} of the fifteen judges were endorsed for re-election by both parties and returned to office without opposition. The fifteenth, 75-year-old Joseph L. Kun, was President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and had served on the court for thirty years. In February, lawyers from the city bar association voted by a 2-to-1 margin to not endorse his re-election, calling him unqualified to hold office. Despite the bipartisan effort against him among the city's lawyers, Kun filed for re-election in both parties' primaries. Kun won the Republican nomination handily, but lost the Democratic nomination to Earl Chudoff, {{a member of the}} federal House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district. In November, Chudoff won easily, taking 58% of the vote. Kun, already in poor health, retired from <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>of</b> law and died in 1961. Chudoff remained on the bench until 1974.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on an {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>professions</b> <b>of</b> Czech deputies {{in the interwar period}} and in the period after 1989. Based on the theoretical framework of representation we assume that voting decisions are influenced not only by party electoral programs, but also by the individual characteristics <b>of</b> candidates. Candidate <b>professions</b> may indicate whether they are considered to be sufficiently qualified and whether they are considered to represent the interests of voters. The aim of the article is to analyse the differences between two historical periods and the differences among parliamentary parties. The analysis proved that <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>professions</b> <b>of</b> parliamentary representatives changed dramatically over time. <b>The</b> <b>professions</b> <b>of</b> representatives in <b>the</b> interwar period tended to resemble <b>the</b> <b>professions</b> <b>of</b> their core voters, and hence were rather different across political parties. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>professions</b> <b>of</b> parliamentary representatives elected on the party list of different parties became rather similar after 1989. A clear tendency towards the emergence of professional politicians can be observed. A descriptive type of representation is on the decline...|$|R

5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state expert {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>of</b> forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is {{the only one in the}} country and is located in her Center. No one had ever had such a monopoly.|$|E
5|$|Like scholar-officials, {{military}} generals {{were ranked}} in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations {{every five years}} (as opposed to three years for officials). However, military officers had less prestige than officials. This was due to their hereditary service (instead of solely merit-based) and Confucian values that dictated those who chose <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>of</b> violence (wu) over the cultured pursuits of knowledge (wen). Although seen as less prestigious, military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations, and after 1478 the military even held their own examinations to test military skills. In addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the Yuan period, the Ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector. In the early half of the dynasty, men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office; this trend was reversed during {{the latter half of}} the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E

Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms, {{as well as his}} precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor. Grant has been outspoken about his antipathy towards <b>the</b> <b>profession</b> <b>of</b> acting, and in his disdain towards the culture of celebrity and hostility towards the media. In a career spanning 30years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling, but rather a career that developed by happenstance.|$|E
