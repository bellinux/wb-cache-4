5|$|Comstock and {{his allies}} also took aim at the libertarians and utopians who {{comprised}} the free love movement– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage. The free love proponents were the only group <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, {{setting the stage for}} the birth control movement.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{addressed}} the party's platform committee, {{and his name}} was placed in nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, where he delivered a speech that strongly criticized President Reagan and praised Democratic unity. He received the votes of four delegates. He went on <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> support the Mondale–Geraldine Ferraro ticket, whose eventual landslide defeat bore some similarities to his own in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Outside Taiwan, POJ {{is rarely}} used. For example, in Fujian, Xiamen University uses a romanization known as Bbánlám pìngyīm, based on Pinyin.

5|$|This {{integrated}} viral DNA {{may then}} lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection. <b>To</b> <b>actively</b> produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors {{need to be}} present, {{the most important of}} which is NF-κB (NF kappaB), which is upregulated when T-cells become activated. This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} Reitz {{was one of}} {{the first}} Afrikaners <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> develop a so-called Bantu policy, in philosophy and terminology going beyond contemporary ideas on segregation between white and black. Under his government Indian immigrants were by law forbidden to settle in the Orange Free State (1890). This led to a confrontation with the British government and an extensive correspondence between Reitz and the British high commissioner in Cape Town, in which internal sovereignty was claimed and established.|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E

5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E

5|$|Hydra and {{her sisters}} saw heavy service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the GrecoTurkish War in 1897 until the Great Powers intervened and {{prevented}} the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy. Hydra saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and {{was present at the}} Naval Battle of Lemnos, but was too slow <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> engage the Ottoman forces. She did not see action during World War I, and was reduced to a gunnery training ship {{after the end of the}} war. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in {{association}} with the Peter Tatchell Foundation, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August. Talking to press, the OPDG's Marvin Kibuuka condemned Jones' murder and called for supporters <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> oppose the persecution of LGBT people in both Jamaica and elsewhere. Peter Tatchell later asserted that the lack of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was tantamount to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT hate crime.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s he made {{journeys}} to both Germany and Russia. His experience with authoritarian states – both fascist and communist – helped reinforce his political outlook of a democracy/dictatorship dichotomy {{rather than a}} simple right/left one. During the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39, he helped organise aid to those fighting the fascists and, {{during the winter of}} 193637, he visited the country. At one point the former pacifist Lie also took flying lessons <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> participate in the conflict, but this plan was never carried out.|$|E

5|$|Nemec's {{character}} replaced Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) during season6 after Shanks {{had left}} the show amid controversy after season5. The producers based Jonas's motivation to join Stargate Command on his momentary reluctance <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> prevent Daniel's death, and his feelings of responsibility afterwards. Jonas was slowly integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage over {{the first half of}} season6. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season6, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season7. The role of Jonas was reduced to recurring status in season7.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversation}} {{poems are}} {{a group of}} eight poems composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) between 1795 and 1807.

They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if there is a place for simple appreciation of nature without having <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E

5|$|The first Hindu teacher <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> {{advocate}} and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience, Swami Vivekananda, toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s. The reception which Swami Vivekananda received {{built on the}} active interest of intellectuals, in particular the New England Transcendentalists, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), who drew on German Romanticism and the interest of philosophers and scholars like G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831), the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767–1845) and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829), Max Mueller (1823–1900), Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), and others who had (to varying degrees) interests in things Indian.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} open to all {{women between the ages}} of 17 and 35, in good health, who had {{graduated}} from an accredited high school. Successful applicants were eligible for a government subsidy, paying for tuition, books, uniforms, and a stipend. In exchange, they were required to pledge <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> serve in essential civilian or federal government services for the duration of World War II. All state nursing schools were eligible to participate in the program. However, they needed to be accredited by the accrediting agency in their state, and connected with a hospital that had been approved by the American College of Surgeons.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate <b>to</b> <b>actively</b> campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
