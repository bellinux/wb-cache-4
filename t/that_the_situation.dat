5|$|Sheriff Porttens {{was outraged}} {{that the police}} fled and rounded up the {{officers}} who were missing and ordered them to protect the streetcars, but thirty-three resigned rather than follow the order.

Without police protection, the Traction and Terminal Company shut down operations and refused to restart them until adequate protection could be provided.|$|E

Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron.

The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E
5|$|After {{having been}} {{temporarily}} incapacitated by several severe health problems, President Dwight D.

Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was under control. However, Nixon never made any effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E

5|$|Around Wschodnia street, workers {{opened fire}} on a company of {{soldiers}} and cavalry, and on Południowa street, a unit of gendarmes was surrounded. Several fires begun in the town, as workers set liquor stores on fire, and the government forces assaulted the first barricades, initially without much success. The tsarist representatives called from reinforcements, which came from Częstochowa, Warsaw, and summer training camps. Several infantry regiments entered the city. Eventually, Russian forces sent to suppress the workers numbered six infantry regiments and several cavalry regiments. Despite <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was spiralling into a full blown uprising. On 23 June, all industries, workshops, shops and offices were closed, as the workers and government forces clashed.|$|E

By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E

The logistical and administrative units were being overrun. Recognising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was hopeless, General Bergonzoli and his staff had departed on foot for Tobruk during the afternoon, in a party of about 120 men. General Giuseppe Tellera, the commander of the Italian Tenth Army, considered the possibility of sending a force to relieve the Bardia fortress but in the end concluded that such an operation had no chance of success.|$|E

However, {{the effect of the}} rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to the situation in the 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of Maribor.|$|E

After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Suslov, {{along with}} Anastas Mikoyan, {{operated}} {{in close proximity}} to Budapest in order to direct the activities of the Soviet troops and to lend assistance to the new Hungarian leadership. Suslov and Mikoyan attended the Politburo meeting of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party which elected János Kádár to the General Secretaryship. In a telegram to the Soviet leadership, Suslov and Mikoyan acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> had become more dire, but both were content with the dismissal of Ernő Gerő as General Secretary and the choice of Kádár as his successor. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet criticised Suslov's and Mikoyan's concessions to the new revolutionary government in the People's Republic of Hungary. Despite his initial reservations, Suslov eventually supported the Presidium's decision to intervene in Hungary militarily and replace the counterrevolutionary government's leadership there.|$|E

5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police.

5|$|He {{also said}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> had been {{looked at in}} the wrong way by police, members of {{parliament}} and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man {{does not need to}} have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E
