25|$|Although Hyenas lack perineal scent glands, {{they have}} a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands above the anus open into this pouch. Several sebaceous glands are present between the {{openings}} of the anal glands and above them. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion that the hyenas paste onto grass stalks. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The secretions are primarily used for <b>territorial</b> <b>marking,</b> though both the aardwolf and the striped hyena will spray them when attacked.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human activity {{in the interior of}} Wicklow dates to around 4,300 BCE. Passage tombs, from the Neolithic period, are the earliest and most prominent feature of prehistoric Irish civilisation in the Wicklow Mountains. These tombs sit on many of the western and northern summits between Saggart in Dublin and Baltinglass in Wicklow, such as at Seefin and Seefingan. Archaeologist Geraldine Stout has suggested they had a <b>territorial</b> <b>marking</b> function, much like modern-day border posts. Other prehistoric monuments {{to be found in the}} uplands include stone circles, standing stones and rock art. The presence of standing stones at altitudes suggests they may have served route-marking purposes. The largest complex of hill forts in Ireland is to be found on the hills near Baltinglass.|$|E
25|$|The wildcat is {{a largely}} solitary animal, except during the {{breeding}} period. The {{size of its}} home range varies according to terrain, the availability of food, habitat quality, and the age structure of the population. Male and female ranges overlap, though core areas within territories are avoided by other cats. Females {{tend to be more}} sedentary than males, as they require an exclusive hunting area when raising kittens. Within its territory, the wildcat leaves scent marks in different sites, the quantity of which increases during estrus, when the cat's preanal glands enlarge and secrete strong smelling substances, including trimethylamine. <b>Territorial</b> <b>marking</b> consists of urinating on trees, vegetation and rocks, and depositing faeces in conspicuous places. The wildcat may also scratch trees, leaving visual markers, and leaving its scent through glands in its paws.|$|E

This work presents several video recordings {{of at least}} two gray brockets (male and female) chemically communicating via scent marks. Video recordings demonstrate multiple depositions of feces and urine by the animals, probably for the development of intrasexual interaction and, secondarily, <b>territorial</b> <b>marks.</b> The chemical communication observed is possibly related to reproduction or intraspecific competition for resources.

25|$|Both sexes possess pre-anal glands, which {{consist of}} {{moderately}} sized sweat and sebaceous glands around the anal opening. Large-sized sebaceous and scent glands extend along {{the full length}} of the tail on the dorsal side. Male wildcats have pre-anal pockets located on the tail, which are activated upon reaching sexual maturity. These pockets {{play a significant role in}} reproduction and <b>territorial</b> <b>marking.</b> The species has two thoracic and two abdominal teats. The wildcat has good night vision, having 20 to 100% higher retinal ganglion cell densities than the housecat. It may have colour vision as the densities of its cone receptors are more than 100% higher than in the housecat. Its sense of smell is acute, and it can detect meat at up to 200 metres. The wildcat's whiskers are white; they can reach 5 to 8cm in length on the lips, and number 7 to 16 on each side. The eyelashes range from 5 to 6cm in length, and can number 6 to 8 per side. Whiskers are also present on the inner surface of the wrist, and can measure 3 to 4cm.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of their}} smaller home ranges {{relative}} to other sifakas, group encounters are slightly more common, occurring {{a few times a}} month. It has been noted that the temperament of the golden-crowned sifaka is more volatile than that of other sifaka species and, {{in the case of a}} dispute, this animal frequently emits a grunt-like vocalization that seems to signal annoyance. Aggressive interactions between groups are generally non-physical but include loud growling, <b>territorial</b> <b>marking,</b> chasing, and ritualistic leaping displays. Same-sexed individuals act most aggressively towards each other during such encounters. Scent marking is the most common form of territorial defense, with scent marks acting as [...] "signposts" [...] to demarcate territorial boundaries. Females use glands in the genital regions ("anogenital") while males use both anogenital and chest glands.|$|E
500|$|Olfaction is {{particularly}} important to lemurs, except for the indri, which lacks most common lemur scent glands and has a greatly reduced olfactory region in the brain. Olfaction can communicate information about age, sex, reproductive status, as well as demarcate the boundaries of a territory. It is most useful for communication between animals that rarely encounter each other. Small, nocturnal lemurs mark their territories with urine, while the larger, diurnal species use scent glands located on various parts of their anatomy. The ring-tailed lemur engages in [...] "stink fights" [...] by rubbing its tail across scent glands on its wrists, and then flicking its tail at other male opponents. Some lemurs defecate in specific areas, otherwise known as latrine behavior. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent <b>territorial</b> <b>marking</b> and aid in interspecies signaling.|$|E

50|$|Trail pheromones are semiochemicals {{secreted}} {{from the}} body of an individual to impact the behavior of another individual receiving it. Trail pheromones often serve as a multi purpose chemical secretion that leads members of its own species towards a food source, while representing a <b>territorial</b> <b>mark</b> {{in the form of an}} allomone to organisms outside of their species. Specifically, trail pheromones are often incorporated with secretions of more than one exocrine gland to produce a higher degree of specificity. Considered one of the primary chemical signaling methods in which many social insects depend on, trail pheromone deposition can be considered one of the main facets to explain the success of social insect communication today. Many species of ants, including those in the genus Crematogaster use trail pheromones.|$|R
5000|$|The male {{ring-tailed lemur}} (Lemur catta) has spurs used in making visual/olfactory <b>territorial</b> <b>marks.</b> Both {{males and females}} have a scent gland on their inner forearm (antebrachial) {{approximately}} 25 cm above the wrist joint, however, in the males, this is covered by a spur. In a behaviour known as [...] "spur marking", they grasp the substrate, usually a small sapling, and drag the spur over it, cutting into the wood and spreading the gland's secretions. When on the ground, ring-tailed lemurs preferentially mark small saplings and when high in the trees, they usually mark small vertical branches.

50|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} {{has been known}} to use dung middens as a social tool. The middens are created and maintained by bulls to <b>mark</b> <b>territorial</b> boundaries. To <b>mark</b> their scent upon a midden, the bull will approach the midden in reverse and simultaneously defecate and urinate on the mound, using its tail to disperse, or paddle, the excrement. This action is called dung showering and thought to assert dominance. The middens, usually several feet across, are constantly maintained during the bulls' travels in the night and day.|$|R
5000|$|Scent marking, {{also known}} as <b>territorial</b> <b>marking</b> or {{spraying}} when this involves urination, is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory. Most commonly, this is accomplished by depositing strong-smelling substances contained in the urine, faeces, or, from specialised scent glands located on various areas of the body. Often, the scent contains pheromones or carrier proteins such as the major urinary proteins to stabilize the odours and maintain them for longer. [...] The animal sniffing the scent frequently displays a flehmen response to assist in detecting the mark.|$|E
