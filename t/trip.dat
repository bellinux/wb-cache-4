30|$|The {{literature}} on service <b>trips</b> {{is the most}} limited of all. Service <b>trips</b> are called as such because their main purpose is to perform a service activity; for example, machine repairs/installations, and maintenance/cleaning of premises. Some service <b>trips</b> may contain a component of freight as they may pick-up or drop-off equipment or machine parts for example, but due to the definition previously stated are still classified as service <b>trips.</b> Two key aspects of service <b>trips</b> that differ from freight <b>trips</b> are: (1) the time spent at the receiving establishment—service <b>trips</b> typically take a longer time to complete, this has implications on parking; and (2) vehicle type used—service <b>trips</b> tend to use smaller vehicles {{which may not be}} easily identified, and as such may be mistaken for passenger vehicles [30]. Browne and Wigan [31] estimated that one third of the total commercial vehicle <b>trips</b> are services for small-scale firms (<[*] 60 employees), while for larger firms (>[*] 60 employees), service <b>trips</b> constitute one fourth of the total commercial vehicle <b>trips</b> received.|$|R
