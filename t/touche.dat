25|$|<b>Touche</b> {{was the son}} of Sir George <b>Touche,</b> {{who founded}} a firm of {{accountants}} and was himself active in politics as an alderman of the City of London and Member of Parliament for Islington North from 1910 to 1918. He was sent to Marlborough College and went on from there to University College, Oxford. It was at Oxford that he first became interested in politics.|$|E
25|$|Staying at Oxford {{until he}} had taken his degree, <b>Touche</b> was {{commissioned}} into the Army Service Corps in 1915. He fought at Gallipoli, in Palestine and in Egypt. At one point, his transport ship was sunk in the Aegean Sea. He reached the rank of Lieutenant. When the war ended, <b>Touche</b> read for the Bar and was called in 1923 by the Inner Temple. He joined the South-Eastern Circuit where he specialised in commercial cases. Also getting involved in business, he was elected {{a director of the}} British Automatic Company in 1928. <b>Touche</b> was a very 'clubbable' man who was prominent in London society; he served on the Executive Committee of the United Club for many years and was chairman in 1938.|$|E
25|$|From 1945 <b>Touche</b> was Chairman of the Committee of Selection {{responsible}} for picking Members for other committee service.

This took {{him out of the}} normal party political fray as the Deputy Speaker did not speak, although in December 1958 he was involved in a row over a defence debate. After a Conservative filibuster, <b>Touche</b> passed over Aneurin Bevan and called Christopher Soames to close the debate, but Bevan also insisted on speaking. <b>Touche</b> insisted that he had no choice, while Bevan and Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell objected; eventually the Speaker took the chair and endorsed his Deputy's actions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ultimate}} {{source of}} the drama was Euripides' tragedy Iphigenia in Tauris. Because of its simplicity and heroic themes this work had a particular appeal for 18th-century proponents of Neo-classicism and there were several dramatic versions in the late 1700s, {{the most famous of}} which is Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris (1787). However, the most important as far as Gluck is concerned - because it formed the basis of Guillard's libretto - is Guimond de la <b>Touche's</b> spoken tragedy, which premiered in Paris on 4 June 1757. De la <b>Touche's</b> play was such a success that it was transferred to Vienna in 1761. It contributed to a vogue for the Tauris story in the city. In 1763 a [...] "reform opera" [...] on the subject by Tommaso Traetta with a libretto by Marco Coltellini, Ifigenia in Tauride, appeared on the Viennese stage. Coltellini's and Traetta's ideas on how to reform opera were similar to Gluck's and Gluck himself conducted the work in 1767. Gluck may have wanted to compose his own reform opera on the Tauris theme but Traetta's opera made this impossible for the time being. Instead, in 1765 Gluck composed a ballet, Sémiramis, which has many points in common with it and he reused some of the music from Sémiramis in Iphigénie en Tauride. It was only after he moved to Paris that Gluck finally had the opportunity to set the Tauris story and then only after he had composed another opera on the Iphigenia theme, Iphigénie en Aulide (1774). Beginning work in 1778, Gluck collaborated closely with the young poet Nicolas-François Guillard, who based his libretto on Guimond de la <b>Touche's</b> play. De la <b>Touche's</b> work had been praised for its simplicity, but Gluck and his librettist simplified the drama even further. Their main innovations were to begin the opera with a storm (which would have been more difficult in a spoken drama) and to delay the recognition until the finale.|$|R

5000|$|Maria Carolina's preventatives against Jacobinism were {{rendered}} {{useless in}} the face of the subversive actives of La <b>Touche's</b> fleet, which was obliged to return to Naples shortly after leaving by a storm. The French sailors, [...] "republican agents", were allowed to land on this occasion, inculcating their anti-monarchical sentiments in the Neapolitans. Upon La <b>Touche's</b> departure, on 29 January 1793, Maria Carolina launched an ineffective offensive against Neapolitan radicals, allowing the most dangerous schemers to escape justice. Why the offensive failed can be explained by the fact that her chief of police, Luigi de' Medici, was secretly a radical himself. Concurrently, Maria Carolina arranged a treaty of alliance with Great Britain, on whom France had latterly declared war. By this treaty, Naples was to contribute four men-of-war, four frigates and four smaller ships, along with six thousand soldiers, to protect commerce in the Mediterranean. In August 1793, following the Siege of Toulon, Naples joined the First Coalition, comprising Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal and Savoy-Sardinia, against France.|$|R
