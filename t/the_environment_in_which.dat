5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. <b>The</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E

5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate image of <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{they are moving}} and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E
