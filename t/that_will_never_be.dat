25|$|An evocative {{description}} {{exists in}} words from 1867: ″Look at the dapper little fellow, how neatly {{he sits on}} the back of the old American horse, Reporter. Notice the jerry-hat, the open but determined, never-say-die, countenance, the polished boots, the burnished spurs, the tight-fitting breeches, the long waistcoat, creaseless coat, and general ′get-up′ of that wiry-looking, ten-stone, five-feet-five specimen of humanity, and tell me if he is a ′character′ when once seen <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forgotten.″ Charlie Canavan differs on one point - he states his weight 'when at man's age' did not exceed 9stone (126lb or 57kg).|$|E

Although he was reportedly recovering well, he developed complications {{in the hospital}} and died on August 25, in Cincinnati, Ohio. After his death, Armstrong was described, in a statement released by the White House, as [...] "among the greatest of American heroes—not just of his time, but of all time". The statement further said that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States' citizens and that he had delivered [...] "a moment of human achievement <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forgotten." ...|$|E

500|$|Several former {{intelligence}} officials described the attack as emotionally distressing for the spy agency. Former CIA deputy director John E. McLaughlin said: [...] "It is the nightmare we've been anticipating since {{we went into}} Afghanistan and Iraq." [...] Bruce Hoffman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, characterized the assault as a serious reversal in NATO's war efforts. Former CIA Counterterrorism Chief Robert Grenier described the attack as the Taliban equivalent of a precision guided weapon. [...] "This attack is something <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forgotten in Langley, Virginia," [...] said Jack Rice, who formerly worked as a CIA officer in Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|In 1946, U.S. National {{purchased}} the Wells Fargo Building (since 1922 {{known as the}} Porter Building), a multistory office building located directly adjacent, immediately to the north, to expand its downtown Portland headquarters. United States National Bank of Portland {{changed its name to}} United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964. [...] By 1970, the bank was operating 119 branches. At that time, it announced plans for another major expansion of its headquarters on property it had acquired diagonally across from the Wells Fargo Building. The entire oversize block, bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues, and Oak and Burnside Streets, had been acquired, its existing buildings to be razed and replaced by new U.S. National Bank buildings. The first of these was a seven-story building (the U.S. Bank Plaza, at 5th & Oak), completed in 1974. But the headline structure was the U.S. Bancorp Tower, a 42-story building that opened in 1983 (having already been part of the bank's long-term site plans in 1970, but ultimately delayed until the 1980s). Notwithstanding this major expansion, the firm continued to own and use its landmark 1917 building, which company president LeRoy Staver, in a 1970 Oregonian article, called [...] "a jewel of a banking property and one <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> duplicated".|$|E

Clara made three pictures <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> surpassed: Dancing Mothers, Mantrap, and It." [...] Brownlow made up for this omission by including an entire segment about Bow in his television documentary [...] (1980), for which he interviewed Brooks.|$|E

Harmon was {{responsible}} for Michigan's second touchdown in the third quarter, as he threw a touchdown pass to Ed Frutig, and also kicked for both extra points. Harmon reportedly played the second half with his shirt [...] "half ripped off his back", and [...] "gave the dogged Quaker defense a going over <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forgotten."

2500|$|From 1959 to 1972, the six-member singing group, The Rondels {{dominated}} the musical scene in Laredo. Carlos Saenz Landin, the lead singer, left {{the group to}} work for the Dallas Independent School District but years later returned to Laredo. Lead guitarist Humberto Donovan served in the United States Marine Corps. The late Roberto Alonzo played the bass guitar. Sammy Ibarra, played the keyboard and composed the song, “Lo Mucho Que Te Quiero (The More I Love You).” He subsequently became a pastor. Singer Noe Adolfo Esparza pursued a college career and became a supervisor for Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. As of 2017, he was still performing with the oldies group, Los Fabulosos in Laredo. Joe Lee Vera served in the United States Navy and played drums for The Rondels. Several of Vera's brothers were drummers too. The Rondels packed the Laredo Civic Center Auditorium. Two other songs characteristic of the group are “Ya-Ya” and “All Night Worker.” With their disbanding, Juan Cisneros of Laredo recalls that The Rondels [...] "left a large void <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forgotten." ...|$|E
