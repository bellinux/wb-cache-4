50|$|As {{a partial}} {{check that the}} posting process was done correctly, a working {{document}} called an unadjusted trial balance is created. In its simplest form, this is a three-column list. Column One contains {{the names of those}} accounts in the ledger which have a non-zero balance. If an account has a debit balance, the balance amount is copied into Column Two (the debit column); if an account has a credit balance, the amount is copied into Column Three (the credit column). The debit column is then totalled, and then the credit column is totalled. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>totals</b> must agree—which is not by chance—because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is a posting, the debits of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>totals</b> do not agree, an error has been made, either in the journals or during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified, and the totals of the debit column and the credit column recalculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.|$|E
