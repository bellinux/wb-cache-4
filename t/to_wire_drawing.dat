Equipment was designed to measure the drawing force, drawing torque, amplitude of die and drum oscillation and drawing speed. Reasons are given for selecting mild steel, pure and hard aluminium, stainless steel and hard copper as the materials to be drawn, and the experimental procedure and calibration of measuring equipment arc described. Results show that when oscillatory stresses are applied at frequencies within the range investigated : (a) There is no reduction in the maximum drawing load. (b) Using sodium stearate lubricant there is a negligible reduction in the coefficient of friction between the die and wire. (c) Pure aluminium does not absorb sufficient oscillatory energy to ease the movement of dislocations. (d) Hard aluminium is not softened by oscillatory energy accelerating the diffusion process. (e) Hard copper is not cyclically softened. A vibration analysis of the bull-block and wire showed that oscillatory drawiing in this frequency range, is a mechanical process of straining; and unstraining the drawn wire, and is dependent upon the stiffness of the material being drawn and the drawing machine.

The results show that {{electrical conductivity}} increases during wire wire-drawing to a maximum value, then decreases with further deformation finally reaching a steady state value that is equal to the original conductivity. The initial increase is the result of pearlite plate orientation in the direction of wire wire-drawing, which makes the path of conduction through the ferrite plates more accessible. At a critical strain the cementite plates begin to fragment and the electrical conductivity decreases to a steady state value that is the same as that observed prior <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> <b>drawing.</b> With increasing strain, the cementite particles are refined and the strength increases due to the reduction in inter inter-particle spacing.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} between two multi-stage cold forming processes on an austenitic stainless steel, wire drawing and wire rolling, in terms of reduction ability. In the first step, experimental tests are carried out and reveal that, starting from an identical initial wire, higher reduction can be obtained with the drawing process. In the second step, numerical simulations are employed to investigate ductile damage in these two processes, using the phenomenological fracture criterion proposed recently by Bai and Wierzbicki (2008) and the coupled Lemaitre model {{in the framework of}} continuum damage mechanics (CDM). For the applications to forming processes, the models' parameters are identified first based on different mechanical tests at different loading configurations.

These two damage models are capable of predicting accurately the instant of fracture and also confirm the experimental comparative results between the reduction abilities of the two processes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{continuum}} thermodynamics-based Lemaitre damage {{model is}} nowadays widely used {{to deal with}} coupled damage analyses for various mechanical applications (e. g. forming process simulations). However, such a model, which only accounts for the stress triaxiality (the ratio {{between the first and}} the second invariants of stress tensor) has been found to give incorrect results under shear dominated loading (in terms of damage location as well as risk of crack). Several recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the third stress invariant in damage prediction; the Lode angle parameter is generally used to include it. The idea is to describe completely the stress state in damage model's formulations, which is defined by the equivalent stress, the stress triaxiality ratio and the Lode angle parameter. This later parameter has proved to have an important influence on ductile damage under low stress triaxiality. Xue's coupled damage model accounts for the third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, allowing a better balance between respective effects of shear and elongation on damage. Some extensions of more physically based damage models, such as the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model, have also been presented to account for this influence of the third stress invariant. In the present work, the phenomenological damage models have been implemented in Forge® Finite Element (FE) software to investigate ductile damage occurring during industrial forming processes. This paper presents the comparative study of Xue's model and Lemaitre's model. A complete procedure is detailed to identify the material and damage parameters from experimental mechanical tests on high carbon steel.

40|$|Eliminating a Major Cause of <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Breakage in A- 15 High-Field Superconductors Phase 1 Summary Purpose of the research: The Phase 1 {{goal was}} to make a {{significant}} improvement in the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology used for difficult to draw superconductor precursor composites. Many ductile Nb-Al and Nb-Sn precursor wire composites have experienced the onset of <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> breakage at about 1. 5 mm diameter. Phase 1 focused on evaluating the role that precision rigid guidance of the <b>wire</b> into the <b>drawing</b> die and the hydrostatic stress state at the die entrance played in preventing wire breakage. Research carried out: The research performed depended upon the construction of both a mechanical wire guide and a hydrostatic pressure stiffened wire guidance system. Innovare constructed the two wire guidance systems and tested them for their ability <b>to</b> reduce <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> breakage. One set of hardware provided rigid alignment of the <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> their <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> die axes within 0. 35 degrees using ''hydrostatic pressure stiffening'' to enable the precision guidance strategy to be implemented for these highly flexible small diameter wires. This apparatus was compared to a guide arrangement that used short span mechanical guide alignment with a misalignment limit of about 0. 75 degrees. Four A- 15 composite wires with breakage histories were drawn to evaluate the use of these <b>wire</b> guiding systems <b>to</b> reduce and/or eliminate wire breakage. Research findings and results: In Phase 1, a breakthrough in <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology for A- 15 superconductor composites was achieved by dramatically limiting or eliminating breakage in four different A- 15 composite precursor wire designs during the drawing of these very desirable composites that previously could not be drawn to near final size. Research results showed that the proposed Phase 1 mechanical wire guides were sufficiently effective and successful in eliminating breakage when used along with other advanced <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology <b>to</b> justify the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station. New insights into the formation and growth of a shear type defect that causes breakage lead to improved drawing technology and it will be the basis for further study and improvements included in a Phase 2 proposal. Potential application of the research: This new capability now justifies the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station <b>to</b> replace the bulky, slower and research oriented equipment that currently uses four independent operations for each wire diameter reduction. In a Phase 2 proposal, the designs for each operation were to be optimized for their performance and so they could be used to integrate these individual operations into an Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station.

One way in which wire manufacturers can meet this challenge is to possess a thorough understanding of deformation, friction and lubrication during the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> process, and therefore to make good decisions regarding the selection and application of lubricants as well as the die design. Friction, lubrication and die design during <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> thus become the subject of this study. Although theoretical and experimental investigations have been being carried out ever since the establishment of <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology, many problems remain unsolved. It is therefore necessary to conduct further research on traditional and fundamental subjects such as the mechanics of deformation, friction, lubrication and die design in <b>wire</b> <b>drawing.</b> Drawing experiments were carried out on an existing bull-block under different cross-sectional area reductions, different speeds and different lubricants.

40|$|Continuously {{increasing}} {{price of}} gold becomes the major driving force for substituting the gold wire with copper wire {{in the field of}} wire bonding. However, since the hardness of copper is higher than that of gold, the potential risk for copper wire bonding is that Cu FAB would cause serious splash on aluminum pad and, even worse, damage of Si die. Since free air ball (FAB) formation is controlled by an electric flame-off (EFO) process, EFO settings would have an influence on the FAB microstructure, thus fabricating FAB with different mechanical properties. However, few researches have focused on the correlation between EFO settings and mechanical properties of FAB, let alone the microstructure evolution in the FAB. In the present paper, we try to find the EFO dependence of hardness in copper FAB. Since the microstructure determines the material's properties, the effect of EFO settings on microstructure evolution is studied to try to give an explanation on the FAB hardness variation. Columnar grains in the FAB would make the material properties of FAB anisotropic. Since the FAB hardness along the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> direction has a direct influence on bonding pads, FAB cross-sections are acquired perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> direction. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technology is employed to investigate the microstructure evolution. In the orientation imaging microscopic (OIM) maps, subgrain boundaries are only found at the peripheries of FAB, mainly due to the quench effect by shield gas. Low EFO current results in larger grain size in both FAB and ball neck. Besides, low EFO current produces FAB with larger Taylor factor in the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> direction. Vickers hardness tests are conducted on these cross-sections. Surprisingly, EFO settings have less influence on the FAB hardness in the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> direction.

Forming force and formability in tube hydroforming analyzed. From these studies, we quantitatively clarified the mechanism of improved formability characteristics, such as decreased forming load and increasing bulging diameter...|$|R
40|$|Four {{low carbon}} steels were <b>drawn</b> from rod <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> on a {{commercial}} multi-die <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> machine. Samples were obtained from between dies. Internal damage, {{as a function of}} cold work, was determined using precision density measurements. Nitrogen was observed to have the greatest effect on the ductility of low carbon steel. Interstitial nitrogen causes internal damage, which results in wire breaks. The mobility of nitrogen increases with temperature, which could account for the increased probability of wire breaks at high drawing speeds...|$|R
