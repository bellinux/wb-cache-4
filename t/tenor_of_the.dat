25|$|It was {{the search}} for beauty that had {{attracted}} Metzinger to the abstract. Beauty depends not only on geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself.

25|$|He {{made his}} operatic début in 1920 as Faust at the Poltava theatre, where he sang until 1923.

He had a memorable audition at the Bolshoi in 1924, reportedly reaching the highest notes of the register with ease (throughout his career, he developed a reputation for singing the highest note possible and hanging onto it for the added adulation). At the Bolshoi, he came under the mentorship of Leonid Sobinov, the leading Russian tenor at the time. Kozlovsky went on to sing in over 50 operas as the leading <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bolshoi.|$|E
25|$|In Christian art, {{the hand}} of God has {{traditionally}} been understood as an artistic metaphor that {{is not intended to}} indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment. According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of {{the hand of}} God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible. In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice. In later Christian works it tends {{to be replaced by a}} fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bishop's {{complaints}} is surprising, as Chetwynd {{was often}} guilty of {{much worse than}} financial ineptitude. It seems that he maintained an armed retinue {{and he was not}} afraid to use it. In 1316 Vivian de Staundon robbed a royal official who was carrying a large sum of money to Ireland on behalf of Edward II Chetwynd, together with John Ipstones, a local baron, raised a large force of armed men to prevent Staundon's arrest and then sheltered him from justice, absorbing him into their own retinues. Warrants were issued for the arrest of both of them but, although Ipstones was apprehended, Chetwynd escaped and went to ground, evading several attempts to bring him to court, and the matter seems to have lapsed. In 1321 he again evaded justice by the simple expedient of not answering the summons, when the king prosecuted him for falsely claiming immunity from tolls and harbour dues in London. Despite his criminal history, when he retired in 1330, Chetwynd was allowed the revenues of two manors, Blackfordby and Freasley, and of two churches, as well as his food, fuel, candles, two horses, a capacious lodging at the abbey and hospitality for his guests. Even this was not enough for him: the disgruntled ex-abbot seized the abbey by force and pillaged it. The matter was only resolved when Edward III sent in keepers to restore order. This marked a low point in the reputation of the abbey.|$|E
50|$|Aureliano Pertile (9 November 1885, Montagnana - 11 January 1952, Milan) was an Italian lyric-dramatic tenor.

500|$|After the Court {{published}} its decision, analysts {{offered a}} range of opinions {{about the impact of}} the Court's ruling. An academic co-author of an amicus brief on behalf of Bowman filed by the American Antitrust Institute expressed relief that the loss was on a narrow basis rather than providing a broad affirmation of the lack of patent exhaustion for self-replicating technologies. Kevin Rodkey argued that an analysis under Quanta Computer leads to the conclusion that patent rights covering self-replicating seeds are exhausted on the first authorized sale, including subsequent generations, and that seed companies can only exclude subsequent replantings with carefully written license restrictions. Ronald Mann writing in SCOTUSblog noted: [...] "The <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court came through most clearly when the Court ridiculed what it called Bowman’s 'blame-the-bean defense' – the argument that Bowman did not make new seeds, because it was the seeds themselves that replicated." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} {{numerous}} garage bands began to employ tone-altering {{devices such as}} [...] on guitars often {{for the purpose of}} enhancing the music's sonic palate and adding an aggressive edge, using loudly amplified instruments to create a barrage of [...] "clanging" [...] sounds, often expressing anger, defiance, and sexual frustration. [...] A sense of despondency and restlessness entered the psyche of the youth in the United States and elsewhere, with a growing rise of tension and alienation creeping into the collective mindset—even in the largely conservative suburban communities which produced so many garage bands. [...] The garage bands, though generally apolitical, nonetheless reflected the <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> times. [...] Nightly news reports had a cumulative effect on the mass consciousness, including musicians. [...] Detectable in much of the music from this era is a combination of disparate emotions, particularly in light of President Kennedy's assassination and the ongoing escalation of troops sent to Vietnam, yet displaying what some now view as a bygone innocence.|$|E

500|$|The Importance of Being Earnests {{popularity}} has meant {{it has been}} translated into many languages, though the homophonous pun in the title ("", a masculine proper name, and [...] "", the virtue of steadfastness and seriousness) poses a special problem for translators. The easiest case of a suitable translation of the pun, perpetuating its sense and meaning, may have been its translation into German. Since English and German are closely related languages, German provides an equivalent adjective ("ernst") and also a matching masculine proper name ("Ernst"). The meaning and <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wordplay are exactly the same. Yet {{there are many different}} possible titles in German, mostly concerning sentence structure. The two most common ones are [...] "Bunbury oder ernst / Ernst sein ist alles" [...] and [...] "Bunbury oder wie wichtig es ist, ernst / Ernst zu sein". In a study of Italian translations, Adrian Pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles. Since wordplay is often unique to the language in question, translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original—in this case the English adjective and virtue earnest—or creating a similar pun in their own language.|$|E
500|$|The Eldredge and Gould {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in 1971. The symposium focused its attention on how modern microevolutionary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that [...] "Eldredge's 1971 publication [...] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly." [...] According to Gould [...] "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould." [...] In his book Time Frames Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair [...] "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} that the anti-apartheid movement among South African exiles {{increased in the}} late 1970s, driven partly by the activities of Mayibuye. The Amandla Cultural Ensemble drew together among militant ANC activities living in Angola and elsewhere in this period, influenced by Mayibuye, {{as well as the}} World Black Festival of Arts and Culture that was held in Nigeria in 1977. As with Mayibuye, the group tried to use their performances to raise awareness and generate support for the ANC; however, they relied chiefly on new material composed by their own members, such as Jonas Gwangwa. Popular songs performed by the group were selected for or adapted to a militaristic and faster tone and tempo; at the same time, the <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groups performance tended to be more affirmative, and less antagonistic and sarcastic, than that of Mayibuye. Members often struggled to balance their commitments to the ensemble with their military activities, which were often seen as their primary job; some, such as Nomkhosi Mini, daughter of Vuyisile Mini, were killed in military action while they were performing with Amandla. Such artists also faced pressure to use their performance solely {{in the service of the}} political movement, without monetary reward. Amandla had carefully crafted performances of music and theater, with a much larger ensemble than Mayibuye, which included a jazz band. The influence of these groups would last beyond the 1970s: a [...] "Culture and Resistance" [...] conference was held in Botswana in 1982, and the ANC established a [...] "Department of Arts and Culture" [...] in 1985.|$|E

500|$|Critical receptions {{towards the}} music video were positive. Jillian Mapes of Billboard {{believed}} that the video is [...] "appropriately understated" [...] {{considering the fact that}} the song is all about making an apology. The Improper noticed that the video has [...] "the look and feel of a Hallmark movie and is almost as maudlin," [...] while Amos Barshad of the New York felt that the video was [...] "terrible." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as [...] "a bummer", writing [...] " [...] isn't just about a girl with her calendar permanently stuck on the twelfth month of the year. It's not just about feeling like a Lady Antebellum song. It's about getting stuck in a place of romantic regret." [...] In a different perspective, Kyle Anderson of MTV argued that the music video puts Swift in a [...] "pantheon of modern classics" [...] with regards to its [...] "almost haunting visual sense" [...] which makes up for the inadequate narrative. Leah Collins of Dose.ca called the music video as [...] "dreamy and moody". Her points are echoed by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who deemed the video as [...] "kind of lovely", which corresponds with the melancholic yet regretful mood of the song. Joycelyn Vena of MTV noticed that the video is [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "somber", something that is not synonymous with Swift. Yet, The Oxonian Review considers Swift's [...] "listlessness, the bare trees, and snowy indoors" [...] in the music video attuned to the <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, achieved by [...] "mixing wide shots, medium close ups, and cut-ins of Ms Swift and her ex, matching their gazes across frames, and blurring focus tastefully." ...|$|E
500|$|This already {{applied at}} the top: the {{constitution}} contained an age-requirement {{for the members}} of the Uitvoerend Bewind, which favored the election of staid Patriot regents, and discriminated against the more talented [...] "young Turks" [...] that were appointed Agents, like Jacobus Spoors, Gerrit Jan Pijman and Isaac Jan Alexander Gogel. The <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bewind became more conservative in the ensuing years. The agents went to work energetically, however, and started with an onslaught on the old administrative organization of the country, in a deliberate attempt to liquidate the very identity of the old federal structure. The once mighty province of Holland was carved into three pieces: Amstel (Amsterdam and immediate vicinity), Texel (the northern peninsula) and Delf (the southern part); and the other provinces were often merged in larger entities, like Overijssel and Drente into Ouden Yssel, and Frisia and Groningen into the Eems department. The aim was to organize the country into units with equal numbers of primary assemblies (hence the small Amstel department with its large population). The first elections for the administrative organs of these new entities were held in March 1799. But, of course, such a reorganization did not suddenly change the old allegiances of the people living in these areas. In any case, the new local and departmental administrations, though elected, were supposed to execute the policies as centrally laid down by the national government. As the elections often put people in power who represented the old order (like Joan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk in Ouden Yssel) this was exceedingly unlikely. To put it differently, the political effort to attain [...] "national unity" [...] through reconciliation of the diverse Patriot factions of all stripes, {{got in the way of}} the effort to create an efficient national unitary state, as envisioned by Gogel.|$|E
500|$|The City-Poly {{football}} rivalry is {{the oldest}} American football rivalry in Maryland, {{and one of the}} oldest public school football rivalries in the United States. The rivalry began in 1889, when City College met the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (Poly) at Clifton Park for a football scrimmage in which City's freshman team beat Poly. City remained undefeated in the series until 1908. In the 1920s, the rivalry turned so fierce that riots erupted on the streets of downtown Baltimore on the day before [...] "The Game" [...] when opposing parades clashed resulting in the sons of both the Mayor of Baltimore and the Governor of Maryland were arrested in 1928. [...] By the 1930s a [...] "Peace Pact" [...] was sworn annually and signed by student government leaders of both schools before the cameras of the press in the Mayor's Ceremonial Office in City Hall.

[...] By the 1950s, it had become a Baltimore tradition that after a morning of church services, parades and rallies, the two Catholic high school football powers of Loyola High School (Loyola Blakefield) and Calvert Hall College would play on Thanksgiving Day morning at 10 a.m., followed at 2 p.m. by City-Poly as the two public school rivals at Memorial Stadium on 33rd Street.
