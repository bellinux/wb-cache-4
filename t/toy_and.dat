5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney <b>Toy</b> <b>and</b> Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E

A running gag of the series is Bender's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind-up <b>toy</b> <b>and</b> the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E

Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} they did not know that they needed a private showing.|$|E
