In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha's tears).

5|$|White's Natural History {{was at once}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics and the public, and continued to be admired by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, John Ruskin, Virginia Woolf, and W.

The book has been enjoyed for its charm and apparent simplicity, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> creates a vision of pre-industrial England.|$|E
5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E

40|$|About the book: Emphasizing a performative and stage-centered approach, {{this book}} {{considers}} early modern European theater {{as an international}} phenomenon. Early modern theater was remarkable both in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> represented material and symbolic exchanges across political, linguistic, and cultural borders (both "national" and "regional") but also in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> enacted them. Contributors study various modalities of exchange, including the material and causal influence of one theater upon another, {{as in the case}} of actors traveling beyond their own regional boundaries; generalized and systemic influence, such as the diffused effect of Italian comedy on English drama; the transmission of theoretical and ethical ideas about the theater by humanist vehicles; the implicit dialogue and exchange generated by actors playing "foreign" roles; and polyglot linguistic resonances that evoke circum-Mediterranean "cultural geographies. " In analyzing theater as a medium of dialogic communication, the volume emphasizes cultural relationships of exchange and reciprocity more than unilateral encounters of hegemony and domination...|$|R

According to founder Robert Baden-Powell, the Scout method works naturally and unconsciously: naturally in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> follows the natural impulses of the Scout, and unconsciously because the Scout is not aware of the education.|$|E
25|$|Western {{churches have}} arrived at the {{position}} that, although the Filioque is doctrinally sound, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue. Thus, without abandoning the Filioque, some Western churches have come to accept {{that it could be}} omitted from the Creed without violating any core theological principles. This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again to share a common understanding of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, Wetu Telu syncretism was {{widespread}} in Lombok. Then, another, stricter, version of Islam began to gain ground, known as the Waktu Lima. Waktu Lima ("five times") is similar to mainstream Islam, but more orthodox in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> tries to eliminate Wetu Telu. Waktu Lima originated when the 19th century purist reforms in the Arab world were brought to Lombok by Sasak hajjis (pilgrims to Mecca and Medina). Concerned by the version of Islam practiced by their countrymen, the hajjis attempted to purify the faith by removing all lingering traces of animism. Waktu Lima first spread among the rich, then slowly to other broader layers of society.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time that {{catchers}} began fielding their position closer to home plate, baseball teams began using a less rubbery ball which led to a {{decline in the number of}} runs scored. In the 1860s it was common for teams to score fifty or sixty runs in a game. The combination of the new, harder ball and the continuation of the rise in pitcher's release points helped usher in what became known as the Dead-ball era. The decrease in run production placed greater significance on stolen bases and bunts, which in turn emphasized the crucial defensive role played by catchers. Together, the rules changes and the new protective equipment transformed the catcher's defensive role to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is presently played.|$|E

25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both in {{its very}} {{favourable}} reception by critics and in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing {{fast and loose with}} dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator informs us of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the MMR vaccine was {{the subject}} of {{controversy}} after the publication in The Lancet of a 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield and others reporting case histories of 12 children mostly with autism spectrum disorders with onset soon after administration of the vaccine. At a 1998 press conference, Wakefield suggested that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single vaccination. This suggestion was not supported by the paper, and several subsequent peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. It later emerged that Wakefield had received funding from litigants against vaccine manufacturers and that he had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of his conflict of interest; had this been known, publication in The Lancet would not have taken place in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did. Wakefield has been heavily criticized on scientific grounds and for triggering a decline in vaccination rates (vaccination rates in the UK dropped to 80% in the years following the study), as well as on ethical grounds for the way the research was conducted. In 2004, the MMR-and-autism interpretation of the paper was formally retracted by 10 of Wakefield's 12 coauthors, and in 2010 The Lancets editors fully retracted the paper. Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and is barred from practising medicine in the UK.|$|E
