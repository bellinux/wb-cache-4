5|$|On 24 March 2011 it was {{reported}} that an AASM missile fired from a Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light ground attack/trainer jet, the first Libyan warplane to challenge the no-fly zone during the 2011 Libyan civil war, on the runway just after <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> landed at Misrata Airport.|$|E
5|$|The shootdown {{happened}} {{at a very}} tense time in U.S.–Soviet relations during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing {{a substantial amount of}} hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union. Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> merely been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets, and that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin {{pressure in the}} months leading up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E

2500|$|Rome {{declared}} that their bombers had {{set a new}} distance record, covering 3,000 miles on the outgoing trip from bases located in the island of Rhodes. American Magazine [...] "Time" [...] wrote that the Italians insisted that <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>had</b> been refueled from submarine tankers though in actuality, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>had</b> simply been loaded with fuel.|$|R

5|$|That night, as Jack and Kate {{decide to}} search for the plane cockpit as its {{transceiver}} would allow the survivors to send a distress signal, loud roaring noises and crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie disappears into the bathroom while Jack and Kate awaken the concussed pilot (Greg Grunberg) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for Fiji and hit wake turbulence. After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises heard on the beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.|$|E

25|$|Polar 3 was {{a special}} version of the Dornier Do 228-101. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> been {{equipped}} with a combined wheel and ski landing gear, allowing it to land on snow {{as well as on}} hard surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> modified generators on board, additional tanks and de-icing equipment for propellers and wings. It was also specially insulated for the use in polar regions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941 (thus, {{prior to}} Erdős {{publishing}} {{the question and}} Gallai's subsequent proof) Melchior showed that any nontrivial finite arrangement of lines in <b>the</b> projective <b>plane</b> <b>has</b> at least three ordinary points.

25|$|Through the Chinese ambassador, Zhou {{requested}} {{and received}} permission for Chinese embassy staff {{to inspect the}} wreckage of Lin's plane, which they did on September 15–16. The staff reported to Zhou that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> caught fire while attempting to land, and then exploded. Zhou then sent additional staff to interview Mongolian witnesses of the crash, and to perform a detailed technical assessment of the crash. The report concluded that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> approximately 30 minutes of fuel when it crashed, but attempted to land without activating its landing gear or wing flaps.|$|E
25|$|The initial National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{evaluation}} that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> lost thrust after a {{bird strike}} {{was confirmed by}} analysis of the cockpit voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
50|$|In many {{scientific}} fields, {{the degrees}} of freedom of a system {{is the number of}} parameters of the system that may vary independently. For example, a point in <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>has</b> two {{degrees of freedom}} for translation: its two coordinates; a non-infinitesimal object on <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> might <b>have</b> additional degrees of freedoms related to its orientation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{geometry}} Mukhopadhyaya's theorem may {{refer to}} one of several closely related theorems {{about the number of}} vertices of a curve due to [...] One version, called the Four-vertex theorem, states that a simple convex curve in <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>has</b> at least 4 vertices, and another version states that a simple convex curve in <b>the</b> affine <b>plane</b> <b>has</b> at least 6 affine vertices.|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a Boeing 747-122 (registration number N4713U). It {{was delivered}} to United Airlines on November 3, 1970.

25|$|The pilot {{confirmed}} {{twice with}} the control tower {{that he was}} on the correct runway; controllers did not know <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>had</b> actually gone on to the wrong runway because the airport lacked ground radar and the plane was {{out of sight of the}} tower at the time of its takeoff.|$|E
