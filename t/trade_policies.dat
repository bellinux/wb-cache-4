5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international free <b>trade</b> <b>policies,</b> inflation and the Savings and Loans Crisis contributed to the recession that impacted cities like Cleveland. While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several production centers.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective <b>trade</b> <b>policies.</b> In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E

He was nevertheless nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1895 by the Free Trade Premier, George Reid. He continued his support of free <b>trade</b> <b>policies,</b> but differentiated himself from his colleagues by firmly opposing restrictions on Asian immigration. He had expressed regret concerning {{the fate of the}} Australian Aborigines in a Telegraph article in 1888 and also opposed Sir Henry Parkes's poll tax on the Chinese, and now opposed the continuing restrictive measures passed in 1896 and 1898.

40|$|The European Union is a {{key player}} in the Doha Development Round of {{multilateral}} trade negotiations. This article argues that its negotiating position reflects distinctive patterns of politics underlying three aspects of <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> - traditional <b>trade</b> <b>policy,</b> commercial <b>policy</b> and social <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> - characterized by different sets of actors and political dynamics. Although there is significant variation in the substance of the EU's position within each aspect of <b>trade</b> <b>policy,</b> their distinctive patterns of politics help to explain why the EU's negotiating position is most liberal in traditional <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> and least in social <b>trade</b> <b>policy.</b> Copyright (c) 2007 The Author(s); Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{link between}} <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> {{uncertainty}} and {{the share of}} investment in GDP per capita is investigated using panel data drawn from over a hundred countries for the period 1960 - 2000. Five indicators of <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> are used. Two specifications of volatility {{for each of the}} <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> indicators are constructed as measures of <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> uncertainty. Panel regression results suggest a robust correlation between the volatility of <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> indicators and the investment share. A significant negative impact of <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> volatility on the investment share is found in most <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> indicators with an exception-the volatility of the trade share indicator more closely associated with volatility in quantity than in prices has a significant positive impact on the investment share.

5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs {{on a host of}} manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs {{on a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on strategic <b>trade</b> <b>policy.</b> Strategic <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> is defined as <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> that conditions or alters a strategic relationship between firms, implying that strategic <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> focuses primarily on <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> {{in the presence of}} oligopoly. The key point is that strategic relationships between firms introduce additional motives for <b>trade</b> <b>policy,</b> over and above terms of trade and other effects that arise in all market structures. I demonstrate this general point using a simple game theoretic framework, then present the major results of strategic <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> using two models: the 'third market' model, in which oligopolistic firms in two exporting nations export the good in question exclusively to a third country; and the 'reciprocal markets' model, in which firms in two countries compete in each others' markets. The paper makes the well-known point that slight differences in model structure can give rise to strikingly different <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> implications, but also seeks to emphasize the robust general points that emerge from the literature. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{international}} trade models explain comparative advantage and describe aggregate gains {{for a country}} from trade and from terms-of-trade improvement but do not address the politics of international <b>trade</b> <b>policy.</b> A positive or predictive model that studies the politics of <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> requires two premises, both with public choice origins: (1) that political self-interest underlies <b>policy</b> determination of <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> rather than social-welfare objectives, and (2) politically assignable rents are preferred to budgetary revenue from trade restrictions and aggregate gains from terms-of-trade improvement. Originating political-economy models of protectionism and reciprocal trade liberalization acknowledge on both premises.

This analysis has focused on the linkages between the <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> contents and the domestic institutional variables: electoral systems, government fragmentation, cabinet durability and the time horizons of top executives remaining in office. The empirical finding suggests that the existence of PR system was not statistically associated with the <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> making in three decades that were examined, however variations of seats allocated by the PR system could be a potentially important variable for shaping <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> making. When political parties disagreed over the direction of <b>trade</b> <b>policy,</b> structures of partisan composition of cabinet could influence trade policy-making in some countries. The cabinet durability variable does not seem {{to play an important role}} in determining <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> directions. The empirical findings also revealed that the duration of top executives was very important in shaping <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> directions as well as the degree to which it was liberalized or protected in some OECD countries. ...|$|R
