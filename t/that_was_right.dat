5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> under the access hatch.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{internment}} facility {{had its own}} U.S. Army run {{hospital to}} serve detainees. It offered comprehensive healthcare. There was an emergency room, internal medicine clinic, optometry clinic, psychiatric services, orthopedic/surgical unit, physical therapy clinic, pharmacy, dental clinic, dietary services and more. Detainees were screened by medics and doctors at the wire, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> out where the detainees are housed, and then triaged {{to the hospital for}} further care. Some detainees were flown to larger medical facilities in Iraq to receive cataract surgery. U.S. Army medical staff was also given training on how to provide care while respecting Muslim traditions.|$|E
25|$|On October 31, 1999 David Gamkrelidze became {{member of}} the Parliament of Georgia. At the first session sitting, he got elected as {{chairman}} of the Healthcare and Social Issues Committee. Gradually, David Gamkrelidze and his friends realized that the ruling party did not actually care for their professionalism and commitment to the matters of national importance. The period of disenchantment began, which reached its peak in the spring of 2000. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> after the ruling party presented to the Parliament the budget for ratification in 1999 and demanded from the majority of the party to endorse it.|$|E

25|$|Realising {{that she}} and K-9 are {{effectively}} on their own, she tries {{to figure out how}} to stop the sacrifice. Her first order of business is determining the when of it. Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property. Rushing home, K-9 and Sarah are briefly upset at missing something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> under their noses all along.|$|E
500|$|Jones, who {{had always}} envisaged herself playing Rachel Bailey when {{the idea of the}} project came in to mind, was given the role, though at the programme's {{pre-production}} stages the character had a different first name, Cathy. It was originally intended that Lindsay would star with Jones in Scott & Bailey, but she became pregnant with twins, so the role of Janet was given to Lesley Sharp instead; Lindsay received the smaller role of Rachel's sister, Alison. Lindsay approved of Sharp playing the role; Jones also felt pleased at the prospect of working with Sharp, saying [...] "I was really excited {{on the day of the}} read-through". Sharp's husband Nicholas Gleaves was awarded the role of Scott's lover, DS Andy Roper. Despite the actors' relationship, Sharp stated that it was not a contributing factor in his casting, stating: [...] "Nick's an actor and I'm an actressâ€” we don't have the same agent. There's a script with a role in it <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for him and it so happened that there was a role <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for me and we both got cast, but it wasn't a conversation that we had that it would be a good idea if we did a television series together because that's not the way life works".|$|E
500|$|During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles {{tried to}} work out a new contract. Several times {{throughout}} the season, Ripken endured batting slumps. He said after the season, [...] "I don't like to make excuses for the fact that I wasn't hitting, but I was distracted... I just felt like the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> or wrong, it was bothering me." [...] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' fans late in the season. He finished the year batting [...]251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBI (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.|$|E

500|$|Many {{respected}} mainstream and underground rappers {{have acknowledged}} Illmatics influence. These {{wide range of}} artists include the battle rappers, SunN.Y. and Reef The Lost Cauze, conscious rappers Talib Kweli and Lupe Fiasco, the producers Just Blaze and 9th Wonder, {{as well as the}} platinum-selling artists Wiz Khalifa, Alicia Keys and The Game, who makes references to the album on his debut, The Documentary In 2006, Illmatic was featured in a list of acclaimed hip hop albums, compiled by Clipse. Malice, a member of the hip hop duo, claimed: [...] "Illmatic captured the whole New York state of mind for me. It embraced everything I knew New York to be. The album had 10 songs, all of them flawless. Me and my homies got great memories of rolling around listening to that, huslin', smokin', chillin'. That embodied everything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> with hip-hop. That CD never came out my deck." [...] Speaking in 2012, British producer, DJ Semtex described Illmatic as [...] "an exemplary album of perfection that forced the evolution of lyricism and production values within hip hop. Eighteen years later it remains omnipotent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long. It's not about me changing the world; it's just about fun music - pure and simple. Music is so powerful. It's powerful enough on a personal level, without me trying to change the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Jones won the National League MVP award after {{becoming}} the first player ever to hit over [...]300 (.319) while slugging 40 or more home runs (45; 3rd in the NL) and doubles (41), drawing 100 or more walks (126; 3rd in the league), notching 100 or more RBI (110) and runs scored (116), and stealing 20 or more bases (25). [...] Ironically, Jones was not selected for the MLB All-Star game that year. He was also walked intentionally 18 times; 2nd in the league, and his [...]633 slugging percentage was 4th best in the NL. A major factor in his selection as MVP was his performance against the Braves' chief competitors, the New York Mets. The Braves led the National League East by only one game as they entered a three-game September series against the Mets, the team <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> on their heels. Atlanta swept the series at Turner Field, though, largely thanks to Jones, who hit four home runs and drove in seven of the thirteen runs that the Braves scored. For the season, he hit [...]319 with a [...]510 on-base percentage, a 1.000 slugging percentage, and seven home runs against the Mets. During the 1999 NLCS, Jones drew the ire of Mets fans by saying, [...] "Now, all the Mets fans can go home and put their Yankees' stuff on." [...] In the playoffs, Jones led the Braves to the World Series against the New York Yankees, in which the Braves were swept. He did, however, hit their only {{home run in the}} series, against Yankees' starter Orlando HernÃ¡ndez.|$|E
