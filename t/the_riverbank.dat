5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after {{following}} the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing her size several times, she eventually finds {{herself at the}} trial of the Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that they are just a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens on <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> and realizes that it was just a dream.|$|E
5|$|The BC Express ran until November 1920 {{and then}} it joined the BX on <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> at Fort George, where their hulls were abandoned. In a sense, they lived on, as their engines and {{equipment}} were shipped to Northern Alberta {{to work on the}} Mackenzie River for the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Gouldsboro was {{discovered}} when a section of riverbank collapsed in 2003 and the Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the area in 2004 to determine how best to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> There are no plans to raise the wreck, but the Corps of Engineers will preserve it in place.|$|E

5|$|Averell had {{anticipated}} resistance at the river, and had Powell's Brigade ready. Major Seymour B. Conger of the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry led the attack {{across the river}} {{on the east side}} of the main road. On the west side of the road, the Lincoln Cavalry crossed the river unopposed. The New Yorkers circled behind the 22nd Virginia, forcing the regiment to retreat from <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ranch Road 1 {{begins at}} US 290 {{on the west}} side of Stonewall, as a two-lane, paved road. The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town's east side. The route {{continues}} along the river briefly passing through a narrow southwestern portion of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, before entering Lyndon B Johnson State Park and Historic Site. The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> and exits the park before intersecting PR 49, which crosses the river accessing the national historic site. After crossing into Blanco County, the route turns away from <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> to the southeast returning to US 290 west of Hye. Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country, the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River.|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, floods have worsened, {{occurring}} {{more frequently}} and reaching levels of several feet deep. Most affected are {{families in the}} communities that are along or near <b>the</b> <b>riverbanks.</b> <b>The</b> river has become narrower and shallower over the years, and its capacity to hold water has decreased.

5|$|The Irwell, sourced at Cliviger in Lancashire, {{flows from}} the north and for a {{distance}} forms the statutory boundary between Salford and Manchester. Flooding has historically been a problem and the Irwell has seen much modification along its course in Salford with some bends being removed, channelisation, and the construction of levees and bank reinforcements. Salford has expanded along the river valley to the north and south and on to higher ground on the valley sides at Irlams o' th' Height and Higher Broughton. Unconsolidated glacial deposits along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> at Broughton have caused several landslides along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> The City Engineer's Department of the City of Salford recorded one such incident near Great Clowes Street in February 1882, and others in 1886, 1887 and 1888. In 1892 the road was propped with timber supports. The tram service along the road was discontinued in 1925, and the road closed to mechanically propelled vehicles in January 1926. Further slips saw the road closed completely in July 1933, and although no substantial movements have been recorded since 1948 slow subsidence around the Cliff continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|The entire 24th Division {{gathered}} {{to make a}} final stand around Taejon, holding a line along the Kum River {{to the east of}} the city. Hampered by a lack of communication and equipment, and a shortage of heavy weapons to match the KPA's firepower, the outnumbered, ill-equipped and untrained American forces were pushed back from <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> after several days before fighting an intense urban battle to defend the city. After a fierce three-day struggle, the Americans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|In the Louisville {{hamlet of}} Louisville Corner (west of Massena), NY37 departs the St. Lawrence River and intersects {{the western end}} of NY131, a northerly bypass of Massena along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> Farther east in Massena, NY37 intersects NY37B, the former routing of NY37 through Massena, west of the village before {{crossing}} over the Grasse River and intersecting the northern termini of both NY56 (where NY37 widens into a four-lane divided highway) and NY420. NY37B later rejoins NY37 east of the village, as does NY131 directly north of the Massena International Airport.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{changes of}} natural and {{regulated}} riverbeds have strong influence on economy development in the zones close to <b>the</b> <b>riverbanks.</b> Understanding of these processes and possibility of prediction are the basis for safe usage of areas close to <b>the</b> <b>riverbanks.</b> River Toplica bed regulation is chosen as experimental section for investigation of morphological changes. Steady survey profiles were established after finishing the regulation works, as basic points for further observations {{of changes in the}} riverbed. Water level recorder was positioned a few hundred meters down the stream. Main causes for morphological development along the riverbed were determined on the basis of changes in geometry of cross-section profiles and water level. Influence of vegetation cover in <b>the</b> <b>riverbanks</b> and hydro-dynamic characteristics of the flow have been analyzed...|$|R

5|$|Near the De Peyster–Oswegatchie town line, {{the route}} begins to {{parallel}} the south {{bank of the}} Oswegatchie River as it merges with the alignment of CR10 (Old State Road). From here, NY184 continues alongside the Oswegatchie River into the town of Oswegatchie and its village of Heuvelton {{not far from the}} town line, where the route becomes known as Union Street. As Union Street, NY184 serves a mostly residential stretch of buildings along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> before ending at a junction with NY812 (State Street) across the river from the village center.|$|E
5|$|On 19 July 1975, a unit {{from the}} Rhodesian Territorial Force (TF) {{contacted}} {{a group of}} guerrillas near a river in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north-east of Mount Darwin in the area covered by Operation Hurricane. After the Territorials killed two of the insurgents without loss, the cadres fell back and set up an ambush position underneath the roots of some overhanging trees on <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> The TF patrol summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando, RLI from Mount Darwin, which arrived soon after. Coey, who was attached to 2 Commando at the time, accompanied 7 Troop as the patrol's combat medic.|$|E
5|$|Further {{north in}} Lysander, NY48 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Baldwinsville Subdivision {{before turning to}} the {{northeast}} as it passes through the hamlet of Wrights Corners and entering Oswego County. Just past the county line in Granby, the route turns northwest, following the western bank the Oswego River (and paralleling County Route57 or CR57 on the opposite side) as it intersects CR46 near the hamlet of Hinmansville. NY48 continues along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> {{to the city of}} Fulton, where it gains the name West First Street south of an intersection with NY176. Like NY31 in Baldwinsville, NY48 originally overlapped NY176 north to NY3 (Broadway), where NY176 continued east. Now, however, NY176 ends here and NY48 continues solo to NY3. Past Broadway, NY48 proceeds north through the remainder of Fulton, now paralleling NY481 extremely close with just Oswego River separating the two.|$|E

5|$|In Brownville, {{the route}} intersects with the {{northern}} terminus of Bridge Street (unsigned NY971H), a short north–south connector leading to NY12F on the south bank of the Black River. At this point, the CR190 co-designation ends and maintenance of the route becomes {{the responsibility of the}} state. Through Brownville, NY12E remains a two-lane residential and commercial street, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR54 (Brown Boulevard) near the Brownville Hotel, a National Register of Historic Places-listed (NRHP) property. At {{the western edge of the}} village, NY12E passes Brownville Cemetery before leaving for the surrounding town of Brownville and losing the Main Street name. The highway parallels a former railroad right-of-way as it heads through the town of Brownville, becoming a two-lane rural highway and gradually bending northeastward away from <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b>|$|E
5|$|NY10 begins {{concurrent}} with NY8 at an interchange {{with the}} Quickway (NY17) {{southeast of the}} village of Deposit near the Broome-Delaware County line. The two routes continue north along the eastern extents of Deposit to {{the banks of the}} west branch of the Delaware River, where NY8 breaks from NY10 to cross over the river. NY10, however, continues northeast along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank,</b> passing south of the Cannonsville Dam and the resulting Cannonsville Reservoir behind it. Near the midpoint of the water body, NY10 crosses over the reservoir on the Cannonsville Bridge and proceeds to follow the northern edge of the reservoir. As the reservoir begins to narrow, NY10 intersects NY268, a connector route leading south to the village of Hancock.|$|E
5|$|NY144 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US9W {{in the town}} of New Baltimore, just north of US9W's junction with County Route51 (CR51). The route heads northeastward through New Baltimore as a two-lane rural roadway, crossing CSX Transportation's West Shore Line before intersecting with a service road that connects to the New Baltimore Travel Plaza on the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY144 passes by a stretch of homes alongside the Thruway and crosses over the toll road, at which point the road enters a residential but wooded area of the town. This stretch leads to the hamlet of New Baltimore, located on {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River. In the residential center of the community, NY144 intersects with the northern terminus of CR61 (River Road). At this junction, NY144 makes a turn northward, following <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> out of the hamlet.|$|E

5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} in loose schools of tens to {{thousands}} of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline—it can survive {{in a wide range}} of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in salinity (and resulting change in buoyancy) by changing the volume of its swim bladder, which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when salinity is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases buoyancy respectively. This adaptation helps the fish in the range of salinities it encounters in its estuarine environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of large dams, {{especially in the}} mid and {{upper reaches of the}} system have significantly affected the ability of fish to migrate up and down the river, and into the Sea of Japan. There has also been {{a significant increase in the}} amount of fishing which takes place in the system which is associated with the introduction of invasive fish species and waterbirds into the system. The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted in the environmental degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken to overcome these issues, including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (popup stores along <b>the</b> <b>riverbank)</b> are regularly set up.|$|E
50|$|In 1844, Ningbo {{was officially}} opened as a trading port, <b>the</b> North <b>Riverbank</b> was hence <b>the</b> {{residential}} spot for foreign merchants. <b>The</b> North <b>Riverbank</b> became <b>the</b> first Bund in China, 20 years before The Bund of Shanghai.
