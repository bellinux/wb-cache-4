5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible {{route to the}} ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, {{around the world to}} interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> attack.|$|E

5|$|Milson led {{the first}} group of Beaufighters into Førde Fjord at about 4:10pm. His {{aircraft}} escaped undamaged after attacking a flak ship and other Beaufighters followed him into the fjord. At about this time 12 Fw190s arrived at Førde Fjord and flew through German flak to intercept the Beaufighters that were waiting <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> attack. The British Mustangs were taken by surprise, but dived to intercept the German fighters. This led to an intense air battle, with over 50 aircraft either engaged in dogfights or diving to attack the German ships; it was the largest aerial conflict ever fought over Norway.|$|E
5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} local two-player {{multiplayer}} with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel {{at the beginning}} of <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> determine how many hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.|$|E

5|$|South of {{the river}} Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, {{commander}} of XXX Corps and Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning of I Airborne Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine. Instead they ordered the Corps staff to prepare a plan to withdraw the division (Operation Berlin). The evacuation of the surviving 2,500men {{able to make the}} crossing was to begin at 20:45. The evacuation would be from north to south, and was modelled on the evacuation from Gallipoli in the First World War. During the day's fighting, some units had become isolated and never received the order to evacuate. Those capable of taking part were formed into groups of fourteen (the maximum capacity of the boats) and guided to the river by men from the Glider Pilot Regiment who during the day had reconnoitred and marked out two routes to the river. Under cover of an artillery barrage the evacuation started at 22:00. German infiltration of the perimeter caused problems during the withdrawal and some groups got into fire fights or were captured. When they reached the river, priority was given to the wounded and regardless of rank the soldiers waited in line for <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> get into the boats.|$|E
5|$|The story mode {{is split}} into several chapters. As the {{narrative}} plays out, the player swaps between different characters. Minigames are also {{incorporated into the}} story. The outcome of minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional game features include Battle Mode, Versus Mode, Training Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer modes include King of the Hill, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> fight, and Survivor, which carries over the current winner's health bar and character selection over each match. Playing through any of the game modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points {{that may be used}} to unlock alternate costumes, music, concept art, and other rewards.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer {{continued}} to press Hitler {{to bring the}} economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played {{into the hands of}} those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be trained.|$|E

25|$|Taxicab {{services}} are operated by nine city-authorized taxi companies and regulated by Authorized Taxicab Supervision Inc. (ATS). ATS maintains a taxicab holding lot under the 96th Street Bridge where, at peak periods, hundreds of cabs queue up to wait <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{pull into the}} central terminal area to pick up passengers.

25|$|By mid-century, Henderson County {{had become}} a major {{producer}} of tobacco, much of which was exported to Great Britain. The area {{was reported to be}} the largest dark tobacco producer in the world; large tobacco warehouses and stemmeries dotted the downtown Henderson area. Postcards from the era show long lines of horse- and mule-drawn wagons piled high with tobacco, waiting <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> unload for shipment downriver. Some tobacco processors accumulated considerable fortunes.|$|E
25|$|III Corps had {{previously}} attached a treadway bridge company to the 9th Armored Division's column, but the 9th needed more bridge-building resources. Over {{the next two}} days, First Army headquarters rounded up three heavy pontoon battalions, the 51st and 291st Engineer Combat Battalions, two treadway companies, and a DUKW amphibious truck company. All were assigned to III Corps and given the task of building two tactical bridges across the Rhine. The two small roads leading into Remagen from the west and south were rapidly choked for miles with hundreds of amphibious trucks, bridging equipment, anti-aircraft batteries, tanks, supply vehicles, trucks with trailers, and thousands of troops who were diverted {{to take advantage of}} the unexpected bridgehead. The approaches to the bridge were frequently backed up with troops waiting for <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> cross the bridge.|$|E

25|$|The {{arena is}} divided between Stocke's three-strong {{party and the}} enemy group. The {{battlefield}} itself is laid out on a 3x3 grid, with enemy units being positioned in different squares of the grid, with some enemy types taking up multiple squares. The player party's position is fixed, but enemy units can use <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> change position on the grid. The battle system itself is turn-based, with each unit on either side being {{given a chance to}} perform an action. Rather than each unit acting once an action is decided, each action is queued once selected, and when all actions are selected the two sides perform their actions. The type of actions an enemy unit can perform depends upon their position on the grid; enemies positioned further back have weaker attack power and strong defence, while those at the front will receive more damage while having a higher attack power.|$|E
25|$|No. 107 Squadron was {{reformed}} at RAF Andover on 10 August 1936 {{as a light}} bomber squadron, {{equipped with}} Hawker Hinds. These were replaced by Blenheim Mk.Is from August 1938 which gave way in <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Blenheim Mk.IVs in May 1939. It was with four of this aircraft that No. 107 {{took part in the}} RAF's first bombing raid of the war against enemy ships in the German port of Wilhelmshaven on 4 September 1939, the day after war was declared on Germany. The raid was no success: of the four aircraft despatched only one returned – and with its bomb load still intact as it {{had not been able to}} locate the enemy. The first British Prisoner of war in World War II was Sergeant George Booth, a navigator with 107 Squadron. He was captured when his Bristol Blenheim was shot down over the German coast on that 4 September 1939.|$|E
25|$|A 14th-century mosaic (right) {{from the}} Kahriye-Cami or Chora Church in Istanbul gives an {{excellent}} {{view of a}} range of costume from the late period. From the left, there is a soldier on guard, the governor in one of the large hats worn by important officials, a middle-ranking civil servant (holding the register roll) in a dalmatic with a wide border, probably embroidered, over a long tunic, which also has a border. Then comes a higher-ranking soldier, carrying a sword on an untied belt or baldric. The Virgin and St Joseph are in their normal iconographic dress, and behind St Joseph a queue of respectable citizens wait <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> register. Male hem lengths drop as the status of the person increases. All the exposed legs have hose, and the soldiers and citizens have foot-wrappings above, presumably with sandals. The citizens wear dalmatics with a wide border around the neck and hem, but not as rich as that of the middle-level official. The other men would perhaps wear hats if not {{in the presence of the}} governor. A donor figure in the same church, the Grand Logothete Theodore Metochites, who ran the legal system and finances of the Empire, wears an even larger hat, which he keeps on whilst kneeling before Christ (see Gallery).|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} their characteristics, Panhandle hooks are nearly the {{opposite}} of Alberta clippers. [...] Instead of forming {{in the north and}} dropping south, these low pressure systems form in the southwestern United States and then move northeast. [...] They get their name from the location where they usually make <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the north; near the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas. [...] Unlike clippers, these storms usually {{have a great deal of}} moisture to work with. [...] As the storms make <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the north, they pull in moist air from the nearby Gulf of Mexico and pull it northward toward Minnesota and other parts of the Midwest. As these systems move to the northeast, there will usually be a heavy band of snow to the northwest of the low pressure center if there is enough cold air present. [...] A wintery mix of precipitation, rain, or sometimes even thunderstorms will then often occur to the south of it. Snowfall over a foot (30cm) is not uncommon with a panhandle hook, and because of the high moisture content in these systems the snow is usually wet and heavy. Large panhandle hooks can become powerful enough to draw in arctic air after they pass by the state, leaving bitter cold temperatures and wind chills in their wake. [...] Panhandle Hooks are responsible for some of the most famous blizzards that have occurred in the Midwest, including the Great Storm of 1975.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} the [...] "little ships" [...] arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May. The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get {{anywhere}} near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about [...] from the waterline {{and wait for the}} soldiers to wade out. In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them. In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn. In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at De Panne and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the winter, the Australian {{divisions}} remained around Messines, {{where they}} had been formed into the Australian Corps. During this time, the brigades rotated through the line, taking <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> man the divisional sector. The 2nd Battalion had spent Christmas at Kemmel before moving on to Wytschaete Ridge on 26 December. They stayed there until late January when they moved on to Méteren. [...] In early 1918, the collapse of the Russian resistance on the Eastern Front enabled the Germans to transfer a large number of troops to the west. As a result, on 21 March, they launched an offensive along the Western Front. On the opening day of the offensive, the 2nd Battalion's lines near Belgian Wood were raided by the 72nd Infantry Regiment and although the attack was beaten off, four men from the battalion were forcibly taken back to the German lines as prisoners. The initial attack, coming along a [...] front between La Bassée and La Fère, was quite successful and with the Germans making rapid gains, the Australians were transferred to the Somme Valley where they were put into the line around Amiens to blunt the attack in early April.|$|E
