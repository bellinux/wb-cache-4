Faith groups meet for worship at meaningful times and locations, where they celebrate the awe and mystery of the divine. Music, art, dance and literature are pathways of one's journey. Reverence is given to Unitarian/ Universalist history and philosophy during service.The UUFAM Mission Statement advocates Peace and Justice by supporting public safety officials, and the military. [...] "We recall to mind their dedication to God, country and humanity." [...] UUFAM 's goals are embodied in the virtues of faith, hope and love. UUFAM brings to light a new [...] "conscious awareness" [...] of Judeo, Christian and Deist theology, by gathering in smaller fellowships, without the need to build [...] "brick & mortar" [...] edifices as a way of promoting the UU faith. UUFAM promotes awareness of their faith on their website, and social networks. In essence, UUFAM is a UU Judeo-Christian/ Deist assembly who gather in fellowship, be it in person or via the net.|$|E

60|$|How had Fanny {{discovered}} the novel of 'Walter Lorraine,' and that Pen was the author? This little person remembered every single word which Mr. Pendennis had spoken {{on the night}} previous, and how he wrote in books and newspapers. What books? She was so eager to know, that she had almost a mind to be civil to old Bows, who was suffering under her displeasure since yesterday, but she determined first <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>application</b> to Costigan. She began by coaxing the Captain and smiling upon him in her most winning way, as she helped to arrange his dinner and set his humble apartment in order. She was sure his linen wanted mending (and indeed the Captain's linen-closet contained some curious specimens of manufactured flax and cotton). She would mend his shirts--all his shirts. What horrid holes--what funny holes! She put her little face through one of them, and laughed at the old warrior in the most winning manner. She {{would have made a}} funny little picture looking through the holes. Then she daintily removed Costigan's dinner things, tripping about the room as she had seen the dancers do at the play; and she danced to the Captain's cupboard, and produced his whisky-bottle, and mixed him a tumbler, and must taste a drop of it--a little drop; and the Captain must sing her one of his songs, his dear songs, and teach it to her. And when he had sung an Irish melody in his rich quavering voice, fancying it was he who was fascinating the little siren, she put her little question about Arthur Pendennis and his novel, and having got an answer, cared for nothing more, but left the Captain at the piano about to sing her another song, and the dinner-tray on the passage, and the shirts on the chair, and ran downstairs quickening her pace as she sped.|$|E

60|$|We must trust {{infinitely}} to the beneficent necessity which shines {{through all}} laws. Human nature expresses itself in them as characteristically as in statues, or songs, or railroads; and an abstract of the codes of nations {{would be a}} transcript of the common conscience. Governments {{have their origin in}} the moral identity of men. Reason for one is seen to be reason for another, and for every other. There is a middle measure which satisfies all parties, be they never so many or so resolute for their own. Every man finds a sanction for his simplest claims and deeds in decisions of his own mind, which he calls Truth and Holiness. In these decisions all the citizens find a perfect agreement, and only in these; not in what is good to eat, good to wear, good use of time, or what amount of land or of public aid, each is entitled to claim. This truth and justice men presently endeavor <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>application</b> of to the measuring of land, the apportionment of service, the protection of life and property. Their first endeavors, no doubt, are very awkward. Yet absolute right is the first governor; or, every government is an impure theocracy. The idea after which each community is aiming to make and mend its law, is the will of the wise man. The wise man it cannot find in nature, and it makes awkward but earnest efforts to secure his government by contrivance; as by causing the entire people to give their voices on every measure; or by a double choice to get the representation of the whole; or, by a selection of the best citizens; or to secure the advantages of efficiency and internal peace by confiding the government to one, who may himself select his agents. All forms of government symbolize an immortal government, common to all dynasties and independent of numbers, perfect where two men exist, perfect where there is only one man.|$|E

6000|$|Men of one idea,--that is, {{who have}} one idea at a time,--men who {{accomplish}} great results, men of action, reformers, saints, martyrs, are inevitably destitute of humor; {{and if the}} idea that inspires them be great and noble, they are impervious to it. But through the perversity of human affairs it not infrequently happens that men are possessed by a single idea, and that a small and rickety one--some seven months' child of thought--that maintains a querulous struggle for life, sometimes to the disquieting of a whole neighborhood. These last commonly need no satirist, but, to use a common phrase, make themselves absurd, as if Nature intended them for parodies on some of her graver productions. For example, how could the attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>application</b> of mystical prophecy to current events be rendered more ridiculous than when we read that {{two hundred years ago}} it was a leading point in the teaching of Lodowick Muggleton, a noted heresiarch, [...] "that one John Robins was the last great antichrist and son of perdition spoken of by the Apostle in Thessalonians"? I remember also an eloquent and distinguished person who, beginning with the axiom that all the disorders of this microcosm, the body, had their origin in diseases of the soul, carried his doctrine to the extent of affirming that all derangements of the macrocosm likewise were due to the same cause. Hearing him discourse, you would have been well-nigh persuaded that you had a kind of complicity in the spots upon the sun, had he not one day condensed his doctrine into an epigram which made it instantly ludicrous. [...] "I consider myself," [...] exclaimed he, [...] "personally responsible for the obliquity of the earth's axis." [...] A prominent Come-outer once told me, with a look of indescribable satisfaction, that he had just been kicked out of a Quaker meeting. [...] "I have had," [...] he said, [...] "Calvinistic kicks and Unitarian kicks, Congregational, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian kicks, but I never succeeded in getting a Quaker kick before."

60|$|Methinks if I had but {{the time}} to speak fully to all things that I could speak to from these two heavenly truths, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>application</b> thereof, surely, {{with the blessing of}} God, I think it might persuade some vile and abominable wretch to lay down his arms that he hath taken up in {{defiance}} against God, and is marching Hellwards, post-haste with the devil; I say, methinks it should stop them, and make them willing to look back and accept of salvation for their poor condemned souls, before God's eternal vengeance is executed upon them. O, therefore! you that are upon this march, I beseech you consider a little. What! shall Christ become a drudge for you; and will you be drudges for the devil? Shall Christ covenant with God for the salvation of sinners; and shall sinners covenant with Hell, death, and the devil for the damnation of their souls? Shall Christ come down from Heaven to earth to declare this to sinners; and shall sinners stop their ears against these good tidings? Will you not hear the errand of Christ, although He telleth you tidings of peace and salvation? How, if He had come, having taken a commandment from His Father to damn you, and to send you to the devils in Hell? Sinner, hear His message; He speaketh no harm, His words are Eternal Life; all men that give ear unto them, they have eternal advantage by them; advantage, I say, that never hath an end. Besides, do but consider these two things, it is like they have some sway upon thy soul--1. When He came on His message, He came with tears in His eyes, and did even weepingly tender the terms of reconciliation to them; I say, with tears in his eyes. And when He came near the city--i.e., with His message of peace--beholding the hardness of their hearts, He wept over it, and took up a lamentation over it; because He saw they rejected His mercy, which was tidings of peace; I say, wilt thou then slight a weeping Jesus, One that so loveth thy soul that, rather than He will lose thee, He will with tears persuade with thee? 2. Not only so, but also when He came, He came all on a gore blood to proffer mercy to thee, to show thee still how dearly He did love thee; as if He had said, Sinner, here is mercy for thee; but behold My bloody sweat, My bloody wounds, My cursed death; behold and see what danger I have gone through to come unto thy soul; I am come indeed unto thee, and do bring thee tidings of salvation, but it cost Me My heart's blood before I could come at thee, to give thee the fruits of My everlasting love.
