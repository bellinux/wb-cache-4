In the present work, the effect of <b>tool</b> <b>profile</b> on the weld nugget microstructure and pitting corrosion of AA 2219 aluminium–copper alloy was studied. FSW of AA 2219 alloy was carried out using five profiles, namely conical, square, triangle, pentagon and hexagon. The temperature measurements were made in the region adjacent to the rotating pin. It was observed that the peak temperature is more in hexagonal tool pin compared to the welds produced with other tool pin profiles. It is observed that the extensive deformation experienced at the nugget zone and the evolved microstructure strongly influences the hardness and corrosion properties of the joint during FSW. It was found that the microstructure changes like grain size, misorientation and precipitate dissolution during FSW influence the hardness and corrosion behaviour. Pitting corrosion resistance of friction stir welds of AA 2219 was found to be better for hexagon profile tool compared to other profiles, which was attributed to material flow and strengthening precipitate morphology in nugget zone.

40|$|Abstract—AA 5083 {{aluminium}} alloy has gathered wide acceptance in the fabrication of light weight structures requiring a high {{strength to weight}} ratio. Compared to the fusion welding processes that are routinely used for joining structural {{aluminium alloy}}s, friction stir welding (FSW) process is an emerging solid state joining {{process in which the}} material that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non-consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters and <b>tool</b> pin <b>profile</b> play major roles in deciding the weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the effect of tool speed (rpm) and <b>tool</b> pin <b>profile</b> on Friction Stir Processing (FSP) zone formation in AA 5083 aluminium alloy. Friction stir welding between 5083 aluminium alloy plates with a thickness of 2. 5 mm was performed. Five different <b>tool</b> pin <b>profiles</b> (straight cylindrical, tapered cylindrical, triangular, square and cone) have been used to fabricate the joints at three different rotational speeds i. e. 900, 1400 and 1800 rpm under a constant traverse speed of 16 mm/min. The formation of FSP zone has been analysed macroscopically. Tensile properties of the joints have been evaluated and correlated with the FSP zone formation. From this investigation it has been found that the <b>tool</b> pin <b>profiled</b> designs had little effect on heat input and tensile properties, weld properties were dominated by thermal input rather than the mechanical deformation by the tool for the plate thickness of 2. 5 mm. straight cylindrical pin <b>profiled</b> <b>tool</b> produces mechanically sound and metallurgically defect free welds compared to other <b>tool</b> pin <b>profiles.</b> Index Terms — AA 5083 aluminium alloy, friction stir welding, macrostructure, micro-hardness, tensile properties, <b>tool</b> pin <b>profile</b> I...|$|R
40|$|AA 2219 Al–Cu alloy {{is widely}} used in defence and {{aerospace}} applications due to required combination of high strength-to-weight ratio and toughness. Fabrication of components used for defence always involves welding. Even though the mechanical properties of the base metal are better, but the alloy suffers from poor mechanical and corrosion properties during fusion welding. To overcome the problems of fusion welding, friction stir welding (FSW) is recognized as an alternative solid state joining method aimed to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties. <b>Tool</b> <b>profile</b> {{is one of the}} important variables which affect the performance of the friction stir weld. In the present work the effect of <b>tool</b> <b>profile</b> on the microstructure and pitting corrosion of AA 2219 aluminium–copper alloy was studied. Electron backscattered diffraction results established that the grain size and orientation of weld nugget of triangle profile is finer than that of conical profile. Differential scanning calorimetric results show the evidence of precipitate dissolution during FSW. It was found that the microstructure changes, such as grain size and its orientation precipitate dissolution during FSW influence the hardness and corrosion behaviour. Pitting corrosion resistance of friction stir welds of AA 2219 was found to be better for triangle profile tool compared to conical profile which is attributed to material flow and strengthening precipitate morphology in various zones. Higher amount of heat generation during FSW made using triangle profile tool may be the reason for greater dissolution of strengthening precipitates in nugget zone and coarsening in thermo mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ) ...|$|E

30|$|The large strain {{gradients}} in {{the sheet}} material around the curved <b>tool</b> <b>profile</b> made {{the comparison between}} measurements and simulations difficult, as the results were resolution dependent. These gradients, expressed as relative increase of strain from point II to point I (a distance of about 0.2 mm), varied from 26 % to almost 90 %, depending on shearing configuration and material strength. There was also a limitation in the measurement technique that prevented accurate measurements close to the edges as discussed by Gustafsson et al. (2016 b). Also, due to the same phenomenon, measured strains after crack initiation would likely be overestimated since the image correlation algorithm and strain calculations interpret relative movement of the fractured parts as strain.|$|E
