40|$|This {{thesis is}} about <b>the</b> <b>designing</b> <b>and</b> {{constructing}} a microwave ion source. The ions are generated in a thermal and dense hydrogen plasma by microwave induction. The plasma {{is generated by}} using a microwave source with a frequency of 2. 45 GHz and a power of 700 W. The generated microwave is pulsing with a frequency of 50 Hz. <b>The</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> constructed microwave system generates hydrogen plasma in a pyrex plasma chamber. Moreover, an ion extraction unit is <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> constructed in order to extract the ions from the generated hydrogen plasma. The ion beam extraction is achieved and ion currents are measured. The plasma parameters are determined by a double Langmuir probe and the ion current is measured by a Faraday cup. <b>The</b> <b>designed</b> ion extraction unit is simulated by using the dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> constructed ion extraction unit in order to trace out the trajectories of the extracted ions...|$|R
