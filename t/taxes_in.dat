5|$|Most {{taxes were}} due on {{each year on}} 1 September, and levied from {{individual}} landowners by decuriones (decurions). These decurions, analogous to city councilors, were responsible for paying from their own pocket what they failed to collect. Diocletian's reforms also {{increased the number of}} financial officials in the provinces: more rationales and magistri privatae are attested under Diocletian's reign than before. These officials represented the interests of the fisc, which collected <b>taxes</b> <b>in</b> gold, and the Imperial properties.
