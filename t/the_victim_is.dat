5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|The sole player {{character}} is Antoinette Marceau, {{an employee of}} the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. She is aided throughout her investigation by famous detective Hercule Poirot, as well as his friend Dr. Constantine. 10 of the 13 murder suspects from Christie's novel are included in the game adaption. These are Count and Countess Andrenyi, Colonel Arbuthnot, Mary Debenham, Princess Dragomiroff, Greta Ohlsson, Antonio Foscarelli, Cyrus Hardman, Caroline Hubbard, Hector McQueen, and several staff on the Orient Express. <b>The</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> Samuel Ratchett. In total, there are twenty characters featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies of}} <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> taken to <b>the</b> Hamilton County Coroner's Office in Cincinnati, where autopsies {{found that all}} but one of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> shot {{multiple}} times.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> casual {{workers and}} either Irish or Romani people. The Romanis were all from one {{extended}} family. <b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged between 59 years and 2 years old.|$|R
50|$|Juan Corona {{had been}} {{supplying}} workers to the ranches where <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discovered. He housed {{a lot of}} the men that worked for him in a bunkhouse on the Sullivan Ranch, where most of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discovered.|$|R
5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, and <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> coerced into {{paying for the}} ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a juvenile.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex with Nephthys, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written words {{had the power to}} affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris's death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set {{takes the form of a}} wild animal, such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris's corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred. Even the identity of <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris's son by Isis.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> pregnant.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, about 7,314 rape {{cases were}} {{reported}}, {{a rate of}} 9 per 100,000 people. 96.1% of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> female. In 2011, there were about 7,539 reported cases of rape. 70% of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged 21 to 40.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a law {{enforcement}} officer engaged in the lawful performance {{of his or her}} official duties as a {{law enforcement}} officer and the offender knew or reasonably should have known that <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> {{a law enforcement}} officer.|$|R
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. <b>The</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abuse in}} the first degree is a Class D felony if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> 12 to 17 years old, and a Class C felony if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> under 12.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of neglect}} include {{failing to provide}} {{sufficient}} supervision, nourishment, medical care or other needs for which <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> helpless to provide for themselves.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> exhumed from <b>the</b> {{original}} {{place of burial}} on 16 March 2006. On 27 July 2011, twenty-one of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> given a proper burial in a joint grave at a local cemetery in Snagovo including <b>the</b> youngest <b>victim,</b> six-month old Meliha Dogić {{who was killed in}} the arms of her mother by a Serb. The girls mother and father were also killed. Most of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> not identifiable because their bodies had burnt so badly.|$|R
50|$|All <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{found in}} vacant buildings, {{all had been}} raped and strangled. Most {{of them had been}} murdered in Highland Park. Many of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> working as prostitutes, and Atkins said he was {{motivated}} by a hatred of prostitution.|$|R
50|$|Min was {{restrained}} at {{the primary}} school, and transferred to police custody. <b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> treated at three hospitals. Two {{of the children were}} taken to hospitals located outside Guangshan County to receive better care. None of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> fatally wounded.|$|R
25|$|Actual {{attacks on}} humans are rare, {{but can be}} serious, {{resulting}} in multiple penetrating injuries to {{the lower part of}} the body. They generally occur during the boars' rutting season from November–January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> still moving, only ending once <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> completely incapacitated.|$|E
25|$|Any {{sexual contact}} between minors {{the age of}} 9 and 16 is Criminal sexual abuse. When <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> younger than 9 and the {{perpetrator}} 13 to 16, the crime becomes Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault; when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> younger than 13 and the perpetrator 17 or older, it becomes Predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. Sex with a victim with severe intellectual disability at any age, or with a family or household member under 18, is Aggravated criminal sexual abuse, though penetration upgrades it to Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> {{under the}} age of 16, and the actor is age 18 or older, any sexual contact not amounting to the {{aforementioned}} Lewd Conduct is classified as Sexual Abuse Of A Child Under The Age Of Sixteen Years.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the impact of gender, victim job performance, and victim employment status on individual juror and jury perceptions of sexual harassment. Gender, victim job performance, and <b>victim</b> employment <b>are</b> all extralegal factors that were found to influence individual jurors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of sexual harassment. The present study revealed individual female jurors {{were more likely than}} male jurors to find sexual harassment. Although gender did not have a significant effect in jury perceptions of sexual harassment, further analysis revealed females were more likely than males to change their decision on sexual harassment in a jury. Victim job performance and employment status were both found to influence jury perceptions of sexual harassment. When <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good, average performer, or no information <b>was</b> provided on <b>victim</b> job performance, <b>the</b> individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a poor performer. When <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good or poor performer or no information <b>was</b> provided for <b>victim</b> job performance, <b>the</b> jury was more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> an average performer. Individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed or no information was provided than when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> fired from <b>the</b> organization. Juries were more likely to perceive sexual harassment when no employment information was provided than when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed fired. These results have implications for the legal system...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{of various}} nationalities.|$|R
50|$|Other {{casualties}} were treated at hospitals in East Grinstead, Redhill and Dorking. The bodies of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Turkey and buried on 22 February 1959.

25|$|COMPLICITY: <b>The</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> fooled {{or forced}} to concede and unwittingly or unwillingly helps the villain, {{who is now}} free to access somewhere {{previously}} off-limits, like {{the privacy of the}} hero's home or a treasure vault, acting without restraint in their ploy.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, the Knesset {{passed a}} new law outlawing human trade with {{sentences}} for human trade offenses of up to 16 years, and 20 years when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a minor. The law also addresses forced labor, slavery, organ theft, and prostitution.|$|E
25|$|An {{adult who}} engages in, solicits {{with the intent}} to engage in, or causes another to engage in a sexual act with a minor, is guilty of a class A {{misdemeanor}} if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a minor fifteen years of age or older.|$|E

50|$|Her {{analysis}} of murders in Juárez in 2008 and 2009 showed {{that most of}} <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> young people from the poorest neighbourhoods, not drug cartel members, as Mexican officials claimed, and that 98 percent of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> unarmed and 97 percent of the killings unsolved.|$|R

25|$|TDoS {{differs from}} other {{telephone}} harassment (such as prank calls and obscene phone calls) {{by the number}} of calls originated; by occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Murphy (1842), the Court {{held that}} a victim of theft was {{competent}} to testify in a criminal theft prosecution because <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> not formally an interested party; even if the victim might later file a civil suit, any fine or forfeiture would pass to the government.|$|E
25|$|F. It is {{a defense}} to a {{prosecution}} pursuant to section 13-1405 if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> fifteen, sixteen or seventeen years of age, {{the defendant is}} under nineteen {{years of age or}} attending high school and is no more than twenty-four months older than the victim and the conduct is consensual.|$|E
30|$|Almost 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{undergraduate}} (lower than diploma) {{suggesting that}} higher educational levels {{might be a}} protective factor for such poisonings.
