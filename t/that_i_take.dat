500|$|The {{military}} {{dangers in}} such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis' generals controlled the left {{bank of the river}} and its central reaches. Such a long march would almost certainly involve a high wastage of men and horses through exhaustion and disease. However, Marlborough was convinced of the urgency – [...] "I am very sensible <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> a great deal upon me", he had earlier written to Godolphin, [...] "but should I act otherwise, the Empire would be undone ..." ...|$|E
500|$|Acknowledging the album's lack of {{commercial}} success, Dixon {{said she would}} always prefer to [...] "take a chance creatively" [...] than release what she perceived to be stultifying records. She commented: [...] "I knew the single 'Drummer Boy' was a risk. It {{was a very difficult}} record and so far removed from anything I'd done before. I get <b>that...</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> full responsibility for that, but I'm glad I did it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than play it safe and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E

500|$|Though Waters had differing {{ideas about}} which songs they should play, he [...] "agreed {{to roll over}} for one night only", Gilmour told the Associated Press, [...] "The rehearsals {{convinced}} me it wasn't something I wanted {{to be doing a}} lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.|$|E
500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth £136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting {{it ought to be}} for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: [...] "The [...] rehearsals convinced me [...] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable to work on my own." [...] Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E

2500|$|Wells {{has been}} {{described}} as having [...] "the type of voice that you assume could only come from spending your school years continually being beaten up behind the bike racks. It is an instrument so frail and timid yet stunning in its clarity whilst still holding a glimpse of some deeper inner strength." [...] Wells has said that he does not write his music for a specific audience, but [...] " [...] to write things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> pleasure in making – if certain groups of people like it then that's great but the audience is not the starting point".|$|E
2500|$|At one stage, Diệm said [...] "I {{know there}} is going to be a coup attempt, but I don't know who is going to do it", to which Lodge purportedly replied [...] "I don't think that there is {{anything}} to worry about". Diệm then asked Lodge to talk to officials in Washington about Nhu's future; Diệm was still refusing to remove his brother from authority. He said [...] "Please tell President Kennedy I am a good and frank ally, that I would rather be frank and settle questions than talk about them after we have lost everything. Tell President Kennedy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> all his suggestions very seriously and wish to carry them out but it is a question of timing." [...] Lodge did not discuss anything specific with regards to a regime change, but claimed that he was not worried by rumors that Diệm and Nhu had wanted to assassinate him. Lodge expressed his [...] "admiration and personal friendship" [...] and gratitude for Diệm's hospitality.|$|E

2500|$|It {{had come}} at a bad time, as his {{favourite}} retreat at Moor Spa was threatened by Lane being put on trial accused of adultery, and five days later Darwin's baby Charles Waring came down with scarlet fever. Darwin's first impression had been that though it meant losing priority, it would be dishonourable {{for him to be}} [...] "induced to publish from privately knowing that Wallace is in the field", but Lyell quickly responded strongly urging him to reconsider. Darwin's reply of 25 June was a plea for advice, noting that the points in Wallace's sketch had been fully covered in his own Essay of 1844 which Hooker had read in 1847, and that he had also set out his ideas in a letter to Asa Gray in 1857, [...] "so that I could most truly say and prove <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> nothing from Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my general views in about a dozen pages or so. But I cannot persuade myself that I can do so honourably... I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit". He added a request that Hooker be informed to give a second opinion.|$|E
2500|$|Premillennialism {{experienced}} a revival among 17th century Puritans like Thomas Brightman, Joseph Mede, and others. Although {{they were not}} premillennial, the English theologian Daniel Whitby (1688–1726), the German Johann Albrecht Bengel (1687–1752), and the American Jonathan Edwards (1703–58) [...] "fueled millennial ideas with new influence in the nineteenth century." [...] It was authors such as these who concluded that {{the decline of the}} Roman Catholic Church would make way for the conversion and restoration of the nation of Israel. Edwards taught that a type of Millennium would occur [...] "1260 years after A.D. 606 when Rome was recognized as having universal authority." [...] His Puritan contemporaries, Increase Mather and Cotton Mather, openly proclaimed a belief in a literal millennium. Increase Mather wrote [...] "That which presseth me so, as that I cannot gainsay the Chiliastical opinion, is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> these things for Principles, and no way doubt but that they are demonstrable. 1. That the thousand apocalyptical years are not passed but future. 2. That the coming of Christ to raise the dead and to judge the earth will be within much less than this thousand years. 3. That the conversion of the Jews will not be till this present state of the world is near unto its end. 4. That, after the Jews’ conversion there will be a glorious day for the elect upon earth, and that this day shall be a very long continuance." ...|$|E
