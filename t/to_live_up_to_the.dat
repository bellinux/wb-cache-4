Set to become a restricted free agent in July 2006, the Avalanche chose to trade his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for defenceman Jordan Leopold and two second round draft picks. Tanguay felt that the team chose to trade him after he failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team's expectations in the playoffs even though he {{continued to}} struggle with his knee injury. The Flames quickly signed Tanguay to a three-year contract worth US$15.75 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} plays {{of the fourth}} quarter failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> promise that had been shown in the third for the Hokies. Two {{incomplete}} passes and one that gained just twoyards forced Virginia Tech to punt the ball away with 13:49 remaining in the quarter. After taking over at its 33-yard line, Kansas had no more success on offense than did Virginia Tech. After three straight plays with no gain, Kansas was forced to punt the ball away as well. A 58-yard kick by Kyle Tucker pinned Virginia Tech inside its 10-yard line, and the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much beyond the ten-yard line. An incomplete pass and a two-yard run by Branden Ore were all the offense managed before Sean Glennon threw a 20-yard interception to the Jayhawks' Justin Thornton. Thornton returned the ball 30yards to the Virginia Tech two-yard line, and on Kansas' first play after the interception, Todd Reesing ran twoyards for the touchdown. The score gave the Jayhawks a 2414 lead with just 10:57 remaining.|$|E

At the end of the 1980–81 season, Blackpool were in the Fourth Division, the League's basement, for the first time.

25|$|Athar {{played for}} Bangladesh in three ICC Trophy tournaments, in England in 1986, in Kenya in 1994 and finally in Malaysia in 1997. He had a disappointing time in England in '86, as {{he lost his}} place in the side midway through the trophy, due to lack of form. He had scored only 55 runs from 5 innings. The wet {{conditions}} in England didn't suit Athar's batting technique. After being overlooked for the 1990 trophy in Netherlands, Athar returned for 1994 tournament in Kenya. There also, he failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expectations, scoring only 90 runs from 6 innings. However, Athar played a big part in Bangladesh's success 3 years later. He scored 170 runs from 9 innings, with 2 not outs, as Bangladesh became the unbeaten champion.|$|E
25|$|Upon Starr's {{retirement}} in 2000, he was succeeded by Daily News writer Jay Maeder and artist Andrew Pepoy, beginning Monday, June 5, 2000. Pepoy was eventually succeeded by Alan Kupperberg (2001–2004) and Ted Slampyak (2004–2010). The new creators updated the strip's settings and characters {{for a modern}} audience, giving Annie a new hairdo and jeans rather than her trademark dress. However, Maeder's new stories never managed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pathos and emotional engagement of the stories by Gray and Starr. Annie herself was often reduced to a supporting role and was a far less complex character than the girl readers had known for seven decades. Maeder's writing style tended to make the stories feel like tongue-in-cheek adventures compared to the serious, heartfelt tales Gray and Starr favored. Annie gradually lost subscribers during the 2000s, and by 2010, it was running in fewer than 20 U.S. newspapers.|$|E
