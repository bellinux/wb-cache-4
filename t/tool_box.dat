500|$|McGarrett {{returns to}} Hawaii to attend his father's funeral, where he meets state {{governor}} Patricia Jameson (Jean Smart). Jameson offers McGarrett {{to lead a}} new task force to apprehend Hesse and clean up the criminal underworld in the state by any means. However, McGarrett initially refuses and goes to his father's home to investigate the crime scene. While searching the house he finds that Hesse has an accomplice, and also notices a <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> marked [...] "Champ" [...] (in {{the beginning of the}} episode, John referred to his son as [...] "champ" [...] despite never calling him that before). As he takes the box, which has evidence on a case John must have wanted his son to solve, he is confronted by the lead detective in the case, Danny Williams (Scott Caan), a divorcee from New Jersey who moved to Hawaii to be close to his daughter Grace (Teilor Grubbs) after she moved with her mother and her new husband. Despite initial friction between the two, McGarrett decides to accept Jameson's offer, and appoints a reluctant Danny as his partner. They find a lead in suspected gun runner Fred Doran (Jonathan Clarke Sypert); ballistics evidence suggests it came from a gun once owned by Doran. When they arrive at his quonset hut, he attempts to flee, but is killed by Danny following a standoff.|$|E

40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, evaluation and cost analysis of side mounted truck <b>tool</b> <b>boxes</b> and a fuel transfer tank.

2500|$|There {{is another}} version of the model J known as the Duesenberg JN (a name never used by the company either). All JNs were sold with Rollston {{coachwork}} and only ten were produced in 1935. In an attempt to give a more modern look to an ageing design, the JN was equipped with smaller -diameter wheels (versus [...] ), skirted fenders, bullet-shaped taillights, and bodies set on the frame rails for a lower look. The battery box and <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> were redesigned slightly so that the doors could close over the frame. Supercharged JNs gained the logical SJN designation.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, {{winemaking}} {{techniques have}} evolved. The first, primitive [...] "natural wine" [...] or [...] "authentic wine" [...] {{was most likely}} the result of crushed grapes being forgotten while stored in a container. The process of allowing wild yeast found {{on the surface of}} the grape conduct fermentation in an uncontrolled environment creates a very crude style of wine that may not be palatable to many people. Hence the development of various techniques and practices designed to improve the quality of the wine but which could be viewed as [...] "manipulating" [...] or [...] "adulterating" [...] the wine from its natural or [...] "authentic state". At various points in history, these techniques may be considered too much manipulation, more than what a consumer would likely expect, and thus labeled as [...] "fraud". However as these techniques became more common place in the wine industry, they gained an air of acceptability and eventually became just another tool in the winemaker's <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> to help craft good-quality wine.|$|E

60|$|Lighting a fresh cigarette, {{he looked}} about. Mossamedes rolled {{and light and}} shadow played about the machinery. In front, the bright cranks flashed and faded in a shallow pit, the {{crossheads}} slammed between their guides and the connecting-rods, shining like silver, swung out of the gloom. Above, the big cylinders throbbed and shook with the impulse that drove the ship ahead.

6000|$|The little heap of the parson's {{possessions}} {{which he}} {{left on the}} table consisted chiefly of papers, over and above a pipe and a tobacco pouch and some Roman and Saxon coins. The rest were catalogues of old books, and pamphlets, like one entitled [...] "The Use of Sarum," [...] one glance at which was sufficient both for the colonel and the schoolboy. They {{could not see the}} use of Sarum at all. The contents of the boy's pockets naturally made a larger heap, and included marbles, a ball of string, an electric torch, a magnet, a small catapult, and, of course, a large pocketknife, almost to be described as a small <b>tool</b> <b>box,</b> a complex apparatus on which he seemed disposed to linger, pointing out that it included a pair of nippers, a tool for punching holes in wood, and, above all, an instrument for taking stones out of a horse's hoof.

60|$|The cab moved swiftly on. Now {{they had}} reached the open country. An {{occasional}} wooden shack was passed, but that was all. At any moment, John felt, {{the climax of the}} drama might be reached, and he got ready. His muscles stiffened for a spring. There was little chance of its being effective, but at least {{it would be good to}} put up some kind of a fight. And he had a faint hope that the suddenness of his movement might upset the other's aim. He was bound to be hit somewhere. That was certain. But quickness might save him to some extent. He braced his leg against the back of the cab. And, as he did so, its smooth speed changed to a series of jarring jumps, each more emphatic than the last. It slowed down, then came to a halt. There was a thud, as the chauffeur jumped down. John heard him fumbling in the <b>tool</b> <b>box.</b> Presently the body of the machine was raised slightly as he got to work with the jack. John's muscles relaxed. He leaned back. Surely something could be made of this new development. But the hand that held the revolver never wavered. He paused, irresolute. And at the moment somebody spoke in the road outside.|$|E
