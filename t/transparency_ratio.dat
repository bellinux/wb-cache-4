We also calculate the formation {{cross section of the}} eta' bound states from (pi(+), p) reactions on nuclei.

Assuming an attractive interaction and taking the claimed experimental value vertical bar a(eta'N) vertical bar = 0. 1 fm, we obtain an eta' optical potential in nuclear matter at saturation density of V eta' = -(8. 7 + 1. 8 i) MeV, not attractive enough to produce eta' bound states in light nuclei. Larger values of the scattering length give rise to deeper optical potentials, with moderate enough imaginary parts.

These measures have successfully shifted turbid warm lakes to a clear water state, but {{little is known about the}} responses to restoration of key physico-chemical variables. We analyzed the seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations in two subtropical and one tropical biomanipulated shallow Chinese lakes subjected to restoration.

Given the weak institutional frameworks, reduced role of securities markets, imperfect competition in the banking sector and the resulting high cost of bank lending to private firms, the traditional channels (interest rate, bank lending, and asset price) are impaired in LICs.
