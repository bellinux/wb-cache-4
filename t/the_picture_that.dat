5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E

25|$|There were {{selective}} {{portions of}} al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, {{to help support}} <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied {{in a number of}} specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|Father Loison {{described}} {{many examples}} of violence, mostly indiscriminate, directed at the civilian population in the region where he resides. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> emerges from his testimony is that the contras engage in brutal violation of minimum standards of humanity. He described murders of unarmed civilians, including women and children, rape followed in many instances by torture or murder, and indiscriminate terror designed to coerce the civilian population. His testimony was similar to various reports including the International Human Rights Law Group, Amnesty International, and others.|$|E
25|$|The Stranger was Welles's {{first job}} as a film {{director}} in four years. He was told that if the film was successful he could sign a four-picture deal with International Pictures, making films of his own choosing. Welles was given some degree of creative control, and he endeavored to personalize the film and develop a nightmarish tone. He worked on the general rewrite of the script and wrote scenes {{at the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> were shot but subsequently cut by the producers. He filmed in long takes that largely thwarted the control given to editor Ernest J. Nims {{under the terms of the}} contract.|$|E

On {{the one hand}} he was once a famous and {{successful}} business man who contributed to the community in many ways, and was generally well regarded in his lifetime.

500|$|Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was {{the best}} film he had made to that point.

500|$|Deborah Solomon {{considers}} the painting the least satisfactory {{of the series}} as she feels it is congested and somewhat [...] "didactic". [...] Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the Norman Rockwell Museum, and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive. Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal noted that Rockwell's [...] "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedomâ€”again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear {{and the absence of}} want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{aspects of}} the odd {{relationship}} were revealed during Harris' lengthy examination and cross-examination: her visit to the Stiffkey rectory {{where she had been}} made to work as an unpaid kitchenmaid and given only a chair to sleep in; Davidson's repeated promises to divorce his wife and marry Harris; an incident when she and another girl, the latter in a nightgown, had danced in front of Davidson, supposedly so that he could judge their dancing abilities. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> Harris' letter and evidence presented, if true, Tucker says, was that of [...] "a man who is out of control... running around London entertaining teenage girls... adopting the guise of a kindly priest to ingratiate himself".|$|E

[...] Pash took key {{scientists}} into custody and arranged for sites targeted by Alsos, including the University of Rome and the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, to be secured. The Alsos Mission to Italy was reconstituted {{under the command of}} Pash's deputy, Major Richard C. Ham, and Johnson and Major Robert R. Furman were sent from the United States to join him. They reached Rome on 19 June, and over the next weeks interviewed scientists including Edoardo Amaldi, Gian-Carlo Wick, and Francesco Giordani. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> the Alsos Mission built up indicated that the German effort was not far advanced.|$|E
500|$|Harrison married Hetty Cary in 1894. They {{had four}} children: three daughters, Ursula, Constance, and Sally, and a son, Richard. He {{was a member}} of the Episcopal Church.

Harry DeButts, an employee and protÃ©gÃ©, described him as [...] "a little cold when you first met him, but underneath he was a very warm, admirable, capable and wise man". He died on February 2, 1938, of heart disease, and was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia. [...] On the day after Harrison's death, the New York Times carried his obituary, but instead of a photograph of Harrison, <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> ran with the obituary was of John Jeremiah Pelley, the president of the Association of American Railroads, who was still alive.|$|E
500|$|While {{the soundtrack}} {{is not as}} well {{regarded}} as Goblin's earlier scores for Deep Red, Suspiria, or Dawn of the Dead (1978), Tim Lucas felt it [...] "...so fused to the fabric of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> Tenebrae might be termed... a giallo musicale; that is, a giallo in which the soundtrack transcends mere accompaniment to occupy the same plane as the action and characters." [...] Writers David Kerekes and David Slater were also favorable to the score; [...] writing that the film [...] "bristles with arresting imagery and a cracking musical score from ex-members of Goblin". Simonetti felt the score was good, {{but that it was}} only a [...] "medium"-level success. However, it did enjoy a second wave of popularity being remixed in clubs. The album has had multiple reissues in numerous countries since its original release in 1982 on the Italian Cinevox label. That version consisted of only eight tracks. In 1997, Cinevox issued a greatly expanded version on CD, including eleven bonus tracks, with a running time of over an hour. In 2004, the expanded CD was released in the US on the Armadillo Music label. [...] In 2012 it was released again on vinyl by AMS Records (Italy).|$|E

500|$|George N. Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and apartment houses of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> <b>that</b> once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to her taste to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a question that has perplexed the sages from the beginning of time and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application. There are tense dramatic scenes, and above all there is the question that must be faced, [...] "Who's Your Neighbor?"" ...|$|E
