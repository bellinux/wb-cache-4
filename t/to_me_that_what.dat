2500|$|Former Southern Baptist Convention President W.A. Criswell (1969-1970) welcomed Roe v.

2500|$|In an April 2008 {{article in}} Vanity Fair magazine, the {{journalist}} David Rose published confidential documents, apparently originating from the US State Department, which would {{prove that the}} United States collaborated with the Palestinian Authority and Israel to attempt the violent overthrow of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and that Hamas pre-empted the coup. The documents suggest that a government with Hamas should {{meet the demands of}} the Middle East Quartet, otherwise President Mahmoud Abbas should declare a state of emergency, which effectively would dissolve the current unity government, or the government should collapse by other means. Rose quotes former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief Middle East adviser David Wurmser, accusing the Bush administration of “engaging in a dirty war in an effort to provide a corrupt dictatorship [...] with victory.” He believes that Hamas had no intention of taking Gaza until Fatah forced its hand. “It looks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happened wasn’t so much a coup by Hamas but an attempted coup by Fatah that was pre-empted before it could happen” ...|$|E

You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
