25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Thompson {{was cast}} in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay. It {{provided}} a breakthrough in her career, as the production earned rave reviews. She {{played the role of}} Sally Smith for 15 months, which exhausted the actress; she [...] later remarked [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did the fucking [...] "Lambeth Walk" [...] one more time I was going to fucking throw up." [...] At the end of 1985, she wrote and starred in her own one-off special for Channel 4, Emma Thompson: Up for Grabs.|$|E
500|$|With Singer busy {{preparing}} X2, Confessions was rejuvenated with Clooney {{taking over}} as director. Miramax Films agreed to cover distribution duties and co-finance the film. In the end, funding for Confessions came from Miramax, Clooney's own Section Eight Productions, Village Roadshow Pictures, producer Andrew Lazar's Mad Chance, Allied Filmmakers, and The Kushner-Locke Company. Clooney explained, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{came on board}} as a director, for scale, {{and was able to}} bring everybody else on inexpensively, if I could get the film back down to $30 million, then I {{was going to be able}} to get the film made. That was a big part of my pitch to Harvey Weinstein at Miramax." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Aerosmith brought [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{into the}} hard-rock mainstream. [...] Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had {{performed}} the song prior to joining Aerosmith. [...] Perry recalled, [...] "'Train Kept A-Rollin {{was the only}} song we had in common {{when we first got}} together. [...] Steven's band had played 'Train' and Tom and I played it in our band... It's a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back... I always <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could just play one song, it would be that one because of what it does to me". [...] Perry's band began performing the song regularly after he had been moved by the performance of [...] "Stroll On" [...] in Blowup; Tyler recalled his band opened for the Yardbirds in 1966: ...|$|E
500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E
500|$|When Kirk and Spock are {{traveling}} {{on a public}} bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters {{into his own hands}} and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; [...] " [...] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!" [...] On learning about the scene, Kirk Thatcher, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as [...] "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer Mark Mangini) also wrote and recorded [...] "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.|$|E

500|$|McKinley was {{nominated}} for president on the first ballot. [...] Hobart described his subsequent first-ballot nomination for vice president as a tribute from his friends, but Hatfield noted, [...] "it came equally as a tribute from [...] wanted a ticket to satisfy the business interests of America, and Hobart, a corporate lawyer, fit that requirement perfectly". [...] Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance {{in a letter to}} his wife from the convention: [...] "It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the <b>thought...</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> want a nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize all that it means in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable." [...] Despite Hobart's expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. [...] City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.|$|E
500|$|As {{the sets}} were {{being built in}} Las Vegas, {{producer}} Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that [...] "was barely the same". Larry Gross {{also contributed to the}} script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews {{at the time of the}} film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the Friday the 13th franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film [...] "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation." [...] Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and [...] "punched [...] in the mouth." [...] Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it." [...] Bakshi also stated that he [...] "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought that maybe I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did." [...] Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as [...] "a hard R-rated story" [...] but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lyrics to}} this song follow {{a series of}} {{different}} themes, as Grohl noted himself, [...] "Oh, my God, that song's about 15 different things! The only reason why it's called 'Hey, Johnny Park!' is because when I was young, my best friend was this kid who {{lived across the street}} from me called Johnny Park and we were like brothers from the age of 5 to 12. I haven't heard from him since I was about 14 years old and I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> named a song after him he might call." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Norwich sacked manager Nigel Worthington, Roberts {{applied for}} the manager's job.

But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the job I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'. And I thought 'I've known that for the past seven days'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November, Raisman {{decided to}} become a {{professional}} athlete, giving up her NCAA eligibility and a scholarship to University of Florida. She signed with the Octagon sports management firm. She said: [...] "It was a hard decision, but I’ve always thought about it {{in the back of my}} mind. I just wanted to try it and have no regrets, because I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn’t try to go pro, I’d always wonder. I know all the girls at Florida, and they love it there so much. But not a lot of people get the opportunity to be a professional gymnast and be able to have sponsors. I love fashion, so it’s cool to be sponsored by Ralph Lauren." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Wainwright, Poses grew thematically out of {{its title}} track, which was {{inspired}} by his residency at New York City's infamous Chelsea Hotel. Referring to his stay there, he recalled: [...] "I went to all these parties and met all these people and found that, basically, it's like a big revolving door. I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could {{look at it as}} a series of poses and extract from it what I needed for my songs, then I would survive." [...] Describing his writing process, Wainwright stated he typically comes up with a melody line and starts singing phonetically, from which words often appear. To promote the album prior to its release, Wainwright embarked on a tour throughout the United States and Canada.|$|E

Susie was writing great songs and great sentiments, but the structure wasn't quite there. I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can then convince him {{to work with a}} young rude engineer, {{which turned out to be}} , and you couldn't get much younger or ruder than that, then I'm going to end up with a record that has an edge to it, that has some tone to it, that has some rock and roll and that has some feel to it that's as edgy as she is but with great songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} June, Tunney competed at the British Championships in Liverpool, United Kingdom. [...] This is {{the third}} and final Olympic Trial to decide the gymnasts that will {{represent}} the United Kingdom at the Olympics. [...] She won the all around competition with a score of 56.750. [...] She said, [...] "It’s totally unexpected to win. The main focus with it being the Olympic trial was to stay clean and I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did that I could get maybe in the top 5 but to win is incredible. The trials have all gone really well for me so it’s now just up to the selectors to decide what works best for the Olympics. The first year as a senior couldn’t have gone better really and I’m really enjoying competed in front of big crowds. Having won the junior title last year and moved straight up to win seniors is brilliant, I’m very happy." [...] In event finals, she placed second on uneven bars scoring 14.350, fifth on balance beam scoring 13.550, and fourth on floor scoring 13.500.|$|E
