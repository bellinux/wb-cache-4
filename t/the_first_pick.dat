5|$|In 1968, the Rockets {{selected}} Elvin Hayes, {{who became}} an eventual Hall of Famer {{and one of}} the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the draft. The Rockets again had <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the draft in 1984, after winning a coin flip for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> against the Portland Trail Blazers, and they used it to select Hakeem Olajuwon, who later led the Rockets to two consecutive titles in the 1990s. In 2003, the Rockets won <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the 2003 NBA draft through the lottery, and they chose Yao Ming, who became a six-time All-Star before his career was prematurely ended by chronic foot and ankle injuries.|$|E
5|$|The National Basketball Association's first {{overall pick}} is {{the player who}} is {{selected}} first among all eligible draftees by a team during the annual National Basketball Association (NBA) draft. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> is awarded to the team that wins the NBA draft lottery; in most cases, that team had a losing record in the previous season. The team with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> attracts significant media attention, as does the player who is selected with that pick.|$|E
5|$|Olajuwon {{attended}} the 2013 NBA draft to {{bid farewell to}} retiring commissioner David Stern as Stern made his announcement for the final pick of the first round. Olajuwon was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> announced by Stern back in 1984.|$|E

5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick,</b> the Rockies chose David Nied, {{who had a}} 3–0 win–loss {{record with}} a 1.17 earned run average in six MLB {{appearances}} with the Atlanta Braves. The Marlins' first selection, Nigel Wilson, spent the 1992 season with the Double-A Knoxville Smokies of the Toronto Blue Jays organization, and had no MLB experience.|$|E
5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. The decision was highly controversial as the fans in Montreal had hoped the team would take francophone star Denis Savard. Wickenheiser's transition to the NHL was difficult; his popularity was harmed by comparisons of his struggles to Savard's immediate success with the Black Hawks. He {{was traded to the}} Blues midway through the 1983–84 season.|$|E
5|$|Houston {{was again}} given <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the 1984 NBA Draft, {{and they used}} it to select Hakeem Olajuwon from the University of Houston. In his first season, Olajuwon {{finished}} second to Michael Jordan in NBA Rookie of the Year balloting, and the Rockets record improved by 19 games, although they were eliminated {{in the first round}} of the playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bullet Bill" [...] Dudley was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> overall <b>pick</b> in <b>the</b> 1942 {{draft and}} he would {{eventually}} become <b>the</b> <b>first</b> player <b>picked</b> <b>first</b> overall in <b>the</b> draft to enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|R
60|$|M. Papineau, whose nose {{had brought}} him there among <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> <b>picked</b> up <b>the</b> weapon and ran his eye over its silver {{mountings}} with a mingled air of connoisseurship and grief.|$|R
500|$|Each WNBA {{franchise}} {{seeks to}} add new players through their respective annual draft. [...] The WNBA uses a draft lottery {{to determine the}} order of selection for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>picks</b> of <b>the</b> draft; the teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs the previous year are eligible to participate. [...] After <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>picks</b> are decided, <b>the</b> remaining teams select in reverse order of their winloss record. [...] The WNBA requires that players be at least 22years old during the calendar year of the applicable seasons, have either graduated from a four-year university or have completed their intercollegiate basketball eligibility, or have played at least two seasons for another professional basketball league.|$|R
5|$|Staal won <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in {{the draft}} and {{selected}} longtime teammate Cam Ward, while the Toronto Maple Leafs' Phil Kessel was the last player chosen. The annual SuperSkills Competition was held {{the night before the}} Game and featured Alexander Ovechkin winning his third consecutive Breakaway Challenge. In addition, Zdeno Chara broke his own SuperSkills Competition record for hardest shot at 105.9mph (170.4km/hr). Team Staal won the contest 33–22.|$|E
5|$|The {{first player}} {{selected}} in the draft was quarterback Michael Vick from Virginia Tech, who was selected by the Atlanta Falcons after they acquired <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in a trade with the San Diego Chargers. Vick spent six seasons with the Falcons before being sentenced to 21 months in prison for his involvement in an illegal interstate dog fighting ring, eventually rebounding {{his career with the}} Philadelphia Eagles after being released from prison and winning the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year Award in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers and Buffalo Braves (now Los Angeles Clippers), the Trail Blazers entered the NBA in 1970 as an {{expansion}} team, under coach Rolland Todd. Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks {{led the team}} in its early years, and the team failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in its first six seasons of existence. During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach. The team won <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick, and in 1974 the team selected Bill Walton from UCLA.|$|E
50|$|Sugano was {{selected}} as <b>the</b> Giants' <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The Kingston Raiders had <b>the</b> <b>first</b> overall <b>pick</b> in <b>the</b> draft {{that year}} and chose Drake Berehowsky. Berehowsky would win the Jack Ferguson Award for being <b>the</b> <b>first</b> overall draft <b>pick.</b>|$|R
2500|$|To Campo I say: Yes, one bad {{mistake on}} Saturday which I {{know you will}} learn from, but, mate, if I was a {{selector}} you would always be one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>picked,</b> with no handcuffs or chains to inhibit you." ...|$|R
5|$|As {{with prior}} drafts, {{the team with}} the worst overall record from the {{previous}} season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, {{the team with the}} worse record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.|$|E
5|$|Fassel was {{replaced}} by current coach Tom Coughlin who has coached the team since 2004, also to inconsistent results and media scrutiny. The Giants acquired their current starting quarterback Eli Manning via a draft day trade from the San Diego Chargers. Manning had been the quarterback at University of Mississippi, and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in the 2004 NFL Draft. During this period standout Giants players include defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in sacks in 2001, and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record in rushing yards in 2005. The Giants made the playoffs four consecutive seasons, from 2005–2008 (including a Super Bowl victory during the 2007 season), but missed the playoffs in 2009 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|In his lone {{season with}} the Bears, Christopher pitched in 31 games. Among those games was a four-hit shutout against the Rochester Red Wings in the International League playoffs to put the Bears up two games to none. In the {{championship}} series against the Montreal Royals, Christopher pitched seven solid innings in {{a victory for the}} Bears, but injured his back and did not play another game that season. He finished the season with a 16–7 record, a 2.82 ERA and 12 complete games. At the conclusion of the season, Christopher was considered the top prospect in the rule 5 draft, and the Philadelphia Athletics selected him with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the draft.|$|E
50|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft for}} incoming teams Blackwater Elite and Kia Sorento {{was held on}} July 18, 2014. Danny Ildefonso of the Meralco Bolts and Reil Cervantes of Barako Bull Energy were selected as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>picks</b> of Blackwater and Kia respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Any {{expansion}} teams receive <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>picks.</b> In 2015, MLS {{added two}} expansion teams: New York City FC and Orlando City.

5|$|In the 2005 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference had an automatic bid to the Gator Bowl. By contract, the Gator Bowl Association—which produces the game—possessed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of bowl-eligible ACC teams after {{the winner of}} the ACC Championship Game was given a spot in a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game. This was the final year that the Gator Bowl had first pick of eligible ACC teams, as contract renegotiations later resulted in the Gator Bowl slipping to the third selection, beginning with the 2006 {{college football}} season. Virginia Tech, losers of the 2005 ACC Championship Game, were chosen by the Gator Bowl Association to participate as the ACC's representative to the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 2003, MLS made sports {{history by}} signing Freddy Adu, a 14-year-old soccer prodigy and on January 16, 2004, he was officially {{selected}} by United with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. When Adu entered United's regular-season opener as a second-half substitute on April 3, 2004, {{he became the}} youngest player in any professional sport in the United States since 1887. On December 11, 2006, D.C. United traded Adu and goalkeeper Nick Rimando to Real Salt Lake {{in exchange for a}} major allocation, goalkeeper Jay Nolly, and future considerations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Wang Zhizhi {{refused to}} return to China {{to play for the}} {{national}} team and was subsequently banned from playing for China, the CBA stipulated that Yao would have {{to return to}} play for the national team. They also said they would not let him go to the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall. After assurances from Team Yao that the Rockets would draft Yao with their number one pick, the CBA gave permission {{on the morning of the}} draft for Yao to play in the U.S. When the Rockets selected Yao with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the draft, he became the first international player ever to be selected first overall without having previously played U.S. college basketball.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{expansion}} teams receive <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>picks.</b> MLS {{has announced}} that Atlanta United FC and Minnesota United FC will begin play in 2017. As determined by a [...] "Priority Draft" [...] conducted on October 16, 2016, Minnesota received <b>the</b> <b>first</b> overall selection and Atlanta picked second.|$|R

5|$|The Bulls {{qualified}} for the playoffs just twice between 1976 and 1984, {{a period in which}} the team used eight different head coaches, including former player Jerry Sloan. They had a chance to win <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of the 1979 NBA Draft, which would have allowed them to select future Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. However, they lost a coin flip to the Los Angeles Lakers, and went on to choose David Greenwood with the second pick. Although Greenwood averaged 12.6 points over six seasons with the Bulls, he never became an NBA All-Star.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 2001 season having gone 111 the {{previous}} season, {{ending with a}} 4120 victory in the 2001 Gator Bowl against Clemson. Fans' hopes for the new season were {{not as high as}} the previous year, however. Star quarterback Michael Vick was selected with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> in the 2001 NFL Draft, and there were questions about how well the team would cope with the loss of Vick and several other important players. Despite those fears, the Hokies began the 2001 season ranked No. 9 in the coaches' poll and were picked in the annual poll of media covering the Big East to finish second in that conference.|$|E
5|$|The loss to Syracuse was {{followed}} by another to Pittsburgh in the following week. The twin losses effectively knocked Tech out of contention for the Big East championship, as the Hokies were then two games behind first-place Miami. Tech won its next two games of the season, but because Miami remained undefeated, the matchup between No. 1 Miami and No. 14 Virginia Tech was played without conference title implications. Before the Miami game, Virginia Tech accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl, which had <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pick</b> of Big East teams after the Bowl Championship Series gave an automatic bid to the Big East champion. Miami defeated Tech in the final regular-season game for both teams, 2624, and the Hokies began preparations for the Gator Bowl.|$|E
