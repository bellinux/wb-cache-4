40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present our work, where we {{developed}} artificial societies of intelligent agents, {{in order to}} understand and simulate adaptive behaviour and social processes. We obtain this in three parallel ways: First, we present a behaviours production system capable of reproducing a high number of properties of adaptive behaviour and of exhibiting emergent lower cognition. Second, we introduce a simple model for social action, obtaining emergent complex social processes from simple interactions of imitation and induction of behaviours in agents. And third, we present our approximation to a behaviours virtual laboratory, integrating <b>our</b> <b>behaviours</b> production system and our social action model in animats. In <b>our</b> <b>behaviours</b> virtual laboratory, the user can perform a wide variety of experiments, allowing him or her to test the properties of <b>our</b> <b>behaviours</b> production system and our social action model, and also to understand adaptive and social behaviour. It can be accessed and downloaded through the Internet. Before presenting our proposals, we make an introduction to artificial intelligence and behaviour-based systems, and also we give notions of complex systems and artificial societies. In the last chapter of the thesis, we present experiments carried out in <b>our</b> <b>behaviours</b> virtual laboratory showing the main properties of <b>our</b> <b>behaviours</b> production system, of our social action model, and of <b>our</b> <b>behaviours</b> virtual laboratory itself. Finally, we discuss about the understanding of adaptive behaviour as a path for understanding cognition and its evolution...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{motivated}} by the task of describing in natural language a concept defined in an OWL DL ontology. However, rather than focussing on linguistic issues, we {{address the question of}} how to support natural language presentation with inference. We introduce a new non-standard DL reasoning problem, that of finding subsumers of a concept that are suitable for natural language presentation. We present a solution that works by enumerating successively more complex concepts in the limited language ALEN. Although the search space is formidable, specific optimisations that take into account characteristics of natural language enable it to be <b>tamed.</b> <b>Our</b> initial experiments show that the approach may be quite feasible in practice. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{we share}} {{many aspects of}} <b>our</b> <b>behaviour</b> and biology with our primate cousins, humans are, nonetheless, {{different}} in one crucial respect: our capacity {{to live in the}} world of the imagination. This is reflected in two core aspects of <b>our</b> <b>behaviour</b> that are in many ways archetypal of what it is to be human: religion and story-telling. I shall show how these remarkable traits seem to have arisen as a natural development of the social brain hypothesis, and the underlying nature of primate sociality and cognition, as human societies have been forced to expand in size during the course of our evolution over the past 5 million years...|$|R

And they professed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had something in it so horrible that it nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and filled their minds with unusual terror, that they were not themselves for some weeks after.|$|R

25|$|At {{least some}} of <b>our</b> <b>behaviour</b> must be {{influenced}} by <b>our</b> genes because <b>behaviour</b> depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions {{are a result of}} our genes code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work together. Like a computer, the hardware is set in stone, but the software can change how they work, just like our environment. Genes indirectly influence <b>our</b> <b>behaviour</b> as the nervous system and our brain is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or <b>behaviour.</b> The way <b>our</b> neurons connect is dependent on the environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|R

40|$|The {{author is}} {{describing}} {{a concept of}} developing the style of teaching {{on the basis of}} researching, thinking (reflecting) and use. She suggests two ways of personal growth: moving towards congruence and expanding. How do the educators of adults know when to start with making education style better? The key is in three simple questions they ask themselves: 1. I don't understand what is going on here. 2. Is this right? 3. I don' t know how to do this. She emphasises the fact that the personal growth of a teacher is always manifested in his or her style of teaching, therefore working on oneself is necessary to develop this style. If our beliefs aren't in accordance to <b>our</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>our</b> work is unsuccessful, and vice versa: if we succeed in changing our beliefs and viewpoints, <b>our</b> <b>behaviour</b> changes as well. Therefore, a planned self-education is necessary to develop one's style of teaching...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using PL-methods, we {{prove the}} Marden’s {{conjecture}} that a hyperbolic 3 -manifold M with finitely generated fundamental group {{and with no}} parabolics are topologically <b>tame.</b> <b>Our</b> approach is to form an exhaustion Mi of M and modify the boundary to make them 2 -convex. We use the induced path-metric, which makes the submanifold Mi negatively curved and with Margulis constant independent of i. By taking the convex hull in the cover of Mi corresponding to the core, we show that there exists an exiting sequence of surfaces Σi. Some of the ideas follow those of Agol. We drill out the covers of Mi by a core C again to make it negatively curved. Then the boundary of the convex hull of Σi is shown to meet the core. By the compactness argument of Souto, we show that infinitely many of Σi are homotopic in M − C o. Our method should generalize to a more wider class of piecewise hyperbolic manifolds...|$|R
