40|$|Abstract: This {{contribution}} {{reports the}} results of in situ and ex situ surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments from gold decorated sulfide mineral surfaces exposed to oxidative leaching conditions. Mapping studies undertaken using 633 nm excitation clearly demonstrate that SERS is an invaluable technique in studying <b>thin</b> <b>product</b> layers formed on mineral surfaces during leaching. Sulfate-based leaching processes for chalcopyrite are attractive because of their inherent simplicity (impurity management and control in sulfate media is well understood) and copper winning from sulfate solutions is well established. Unfortunately, reasonable copper yields are not attainable in a practical residence time unless the leaching temperature exceeds 200 °C (oxygen pressure leaching) or chalcopyrite is 'activated ' by a pretreatment method prior to leaching [1]. The poor yields are acknowledged {{to be due to}} the formation of a metal-deficient passivating layer on the surface. The composition of such a layer, and the mechanisms by which it forms are, as yet, poorly understood. Oxidative dissolution studies of chalcopyrite in the transpassive potential zone have variously proposed the formation of elemental sulfur [2, 3]; the formation of covellite plus elemental sulfur [4, 5]; and, metal-deficient polysulfides [6] (Cu 1 -xFe 1 -yS 2, x<<y, x+y≈ 1 [1, 7]...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{chemistry of}} two active-metal systems {{has been studied}} primarily with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. First, the interaction of metallic lithium thin films with simple glass surfaces was investigated. Li was deposited on SiO₂, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, and B₂O₃ glasses in an ultra-high vacuum deposition and analysis chamber. The reaction of Li with SiO₂ results in substantial reduction of the glass matrix to form a <b>thin</b> <b>product</b> layer. A negatively-charged Si species was identified based on an unusually low XPS Si(2 p) binding energy. The interaction of Li with alkali silicate glasses resulted in substantially less matrix breakdown than for SiO₂, but exchange of lithium for either sodium or potassium cations occurred at the Li/glass interface. The reaction between Li and B₂O₃ {{was limited to the}} top layers of the glass, as a passivating layer formed at the Li/B₂O₃ interface. Investigations into the oxidation of polycrystalline iron surfaces were initiated. Clean surfaces were exposed to controlled amounts of pure oxygen gas. The resulting oxide composition and thickness was determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and XPS. The results indicated the formation of a bilayer structure, with FeO near the oxide-metal interface, and Fe₃O₄ at the outer surface. Film growth was approximately logarithmic with time, and was strongly pressure dependent. Studies of the electronic properties of the characterized iron oxide surfaces were conducted by measuring the rate of electron transfer between the surface and redox-active species in an electrochemical cell. A strong dependence on film thickness was indicated. Photoemission of electrons from a solid is an inherently complex process; this is especially the case for XPS of clean and oxide-covered active metals. Improved theoretical models of XPS lineshapes were developed which provided new insight into the physical processes involved in photoemission. Additionally, these models provided improved qualitative and quantitative data interpretation through the use of least-squares fitting techniques...|$|E
40|$|Oxides with layered perovskite-like K 2 NiF 4 -type {{structure}} {{have attracted}} significant attention since {{the discovery of}} high temperature superconductivity in La 2 CuO 4 +δ based systems. Further investigation {{of this type of}} oxides has shown that their mixed ion and electron conductivity makes them interesting candidates for high temperature applications, such as cathode material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) or as membrane material for gas separation. Besides their electrical features, these oxide materials have to have other suitable characteristics, such as thermal expansion, chemical stability, etc. Furthermore, when these materials are exposed to harsh working conditions, i. e., high temperature and large oxygen potential gradient, it induces cation transport towards the side with higher partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) which has significant influence on the lifetime of the material. Cation diffusion may cause kinetic demixing and kinetic decomposition due to the different diffusivities of different cations, and morphological instability (membrane walk-out) due to the high diffusivities of the cations. The main topic of this thesis is the determination of the cation diffusion and degradation phenomena in oxides with K 2 NiF 4 -type structure (general formula A 2 BO 4), notably lanthanum nickelate, La 2 NiO 4 +δ (LNO). Structure and transport properties of the undoped and doped LNO {{have been the subject of}} extensive research. Although cation diffusion is one of the properties of fundamental interest for the durability of components serving under chemical potential gradients, data on cation transport and degradation processes is generally scarce, particularly for materials with K 2 NiF 4 -type structure. To date there is no data reported on cation diffusion in LNO-based systems. This thesis comprises studies of A- and B-site cation diffusion in the LNO system, utilising inter-diffusion, chemical tracer diffusion and solid state reaction (SSR) methods. The study of the degradation of the LNO membrane under the gradient of pO 2 is also included in this work. Diffusion couples between La 2 NiO 4 +δ and Nd 2 NiO 4 +δ and between La 2 NiO 4 +δ and La 2 CuO 4 +δ were used in the inter-diffusion method for the estimation of A- and B-site inter-diffusion coefficients, respectively. The chemical tracer diffusion method employed Pr, Nd and Co as impurity tracers for the study of A- and B-site cation diffusion, respectively. The self-diffusion coefficient of the fastest moving cation was determined by SSR between the binary oxides NiO and La 2 O 3. The samples were analysed extensively using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and its additional features (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)). Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were the methods of instrumental analysis used in this work. The inter-diffusion experiment showed that the A-site cation diffuses mainly through bulk, while the B-site cation is faster due to enhanced grain boundary diffusion. The diffusion paths of the A- and B-site cations were visualised by EPMA element mapping of the crosssection of the diffusion couples. The obtained activation energies for diffusion are 275 ± 12 kJ/mol for the A-site cation (La) bulk, 450 ± 20 kJ/mol for the B-site cation (Ni) bulk, and 125 ± 24 kJ/mol for the grain boundary. The chemical tracer experiment revealed kinetics of diffusion of the Pr, Nd and Co chemical (impurity) tracers in LNO. By means of analyses of the SIMS data it is shown that the A-site cation (Pr and Nd) diffuses mainly through bulk, meaning that according to Harrison’s classification of diffusion kinetics it belongs to the “A”-type, and that the B-site cation (Co) has enhanced diffusion along grain boundaries and exhibits “B”-type diffusion kinetics. The average apparent activation energies for the diffusion of chemical (impurity) tracers are evaluated as 165 ± 15 kJ/mol for Pr and Nd in bulk, 295 ± 15 kJ/mol for Co in bulk, and 380 ± 20 kJ/mol for Co in grain boundaries. The unexpectedly high activation energy of the fast Co grain boundary diffusion in comparison to bulk is also discussed. Through the use of inert platinum markers, the SSR confirmed that the fastest moving cation in LNO is Ni. The growth of the reaction layer between NiO and La 2 O 3 was parabolic, as given by Wagner’s parabolic rate law. The obtained self-diffusion coefficient of Ni shows Arrhenius behaviour at higher experimental temperatures (1100 - 1450 °C), with activation energy of 243 ± 21 kJ/mol. At lower experimental temperatures (950 - 1100 °C) the self-diffusion coefficient deviates from Arrhenius behaviour by bending downward and attaining apparently higher activation energies. Some suggestions for this rather unusual behaviour are given in this thesis. In addition, the measurement shows that the Ni self-diffusion coefficient at the higher temperatures is independent of the surrounding pO 2, indicating that the <b>thin</b> <b>product</b> layer formed between the NiO and La 2 O 3 reactants cannot equilibrate fast enough with the surrounding atmosphere at these temperatures. When an LNO membrane was exposed to a gradient in pO 2 for 800 h at 1000 °C, the high pO 2 side of the membrane became decorated by precipitations of NiO. This was expected because the results from the inter-diffusion, chemical tracer and SSR experiments had shown that the B-site cation (Ni) exhibited enhanced diffusion over the A-site cation (La). This decomposition experiment also showed signs of “walk-out” toward the side with higher pO 2. At the membrane’s low pO 2 side porosity and etched-away structure developed, reflecting the loss of material from this side of the membrane. The different data for cation diffusion in LNO obtained by the above mentioned methods agrees, showing similar cation diffusion within anticipated uncertainties. Anyhow, LNO exhibits rather high diffusion values for both A- and B-site cations, even when compared with the data for cation diffusion of related perovskite compounds. It is demonstrated here that long-term utilisation in a gradient of pO 2 can severely degrade and perhaps eventually break the membrane due to “walk-out” and decomposition...|$|E

Whitewood plantings established at stockings rates of 417, 625 and 833 stems per hectare were thinned at age 6 to approximately 45 % retained basal area. The <b>thinning</b> <b>products</b> were measured during harvest and value was estimated based on costs of production and appropriate margins relative to radiata pine products already on the market. Financial modelling for the whole rotation was undertaken {{for each of the}} spacing and thinning scenarios in the trial. The volume and size of poles and posts at first thinning was related to spacing. Low stocking density produced smaller quantities of larger poles, whereas higher stocking densities produced larger quantities of smaller posts. However, the monetary value of larger products grown under lower stocking rates was less than the value of the greater volume of product at higher stocking rates. This greater volume at higher stockings resulted in higher NPV for regimes with higher initial stockings for modelled scenarios regardless of harvest age. An exception was a scenario where no market for thinnings is available. A direct silvicultural regime (i. e. one with low planting density and no thinnings) had the highest NPV due to the higher price per cubic metre of larger diameter logs, achieved more rapidly because thinning did not remove basal area. Where <b>thinning</b> <b>products</b> are marketable, higher initial planting densities provide higher returns. Where access to markets for <b>thinning</b> <b>products</b> is difficult or where infrastructure is expected to improve in the future, planting at low stocking and without any thinning provides a high return on investment...|$|R
