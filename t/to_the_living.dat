5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as most likely a specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> world, complete {{with its own}} bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up {{in the realm of}} the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} has two rooms and an attached kitchen {{on the ground}} floor with a staircase between them leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> quarters in the first floor rooms. The front room may originally have been a shop but was not used for trade after the installation of the new front wall in the 16th century. The front room has recesses {{on either side of the}} arched fireplace. The rear room {{on the ground floor}} was the hall and still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E
5|$|The congregation's {{membership}} was in {{the thousands}} in the 1940s, but by the early 2000s had declined to around 40, as Jews {{moved out of the}} Lower East Side. Though its building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, the congregation was reluctant to accept outside assistance in maintaining it. In December 2005, water damage was found in the structural beams, and services were moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room of the rabbi's mother. In January 2006, the synagogue's roof collapsed, and the building was demolished two months later.|$|E

5|$|The monkey lemurs are {{considered}} to be most closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs, although recent finds had caused some dispute over a possible closer relation to living lemurids. Genetic tests, however, have reaffirmed the previously presumed relationship. Hadropithecus lived in open habitat in the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. It is known only from subfossil or recent remains and {{is considered to be a}} modern form of Malagasy lemur. It died out around 444–772 CE, shortly after the arrival of humans on the island.|$|E
5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> {{conditions}} in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had to make do with a substitute – chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk to make up for the insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction.

5|$|As Dan travels across Gallowmere, {{fighting}} his {{way through}} Zarok's hordes and confronting all manners of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices. After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse, Dan escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and putting the dead back to rest. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber. If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.|$|E
