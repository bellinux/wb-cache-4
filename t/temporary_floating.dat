Neither shall we tell of the difficulties that arose in the matter of getting blocks of granite large enough for such masonry, and lime of a nature strong enough to withstand the action of the salt sea.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{the design of}} a <b>temporary</b> emergency <b>floating</b> footbridge, to be made when the infrastructure is destroyed by a flood, hurricane, tsunami or any other disaster. The bridge is made of identical floating modules. The modules are composed of prefabricated elements: two trusses, a pontoon and the footpath. The height of the trusses is integrated with the handrail. The sides of the pontoons are inclined to stack these elements during transport. The modules are assembled at the site. A completed module is fastened to the other modules of the bridge. The completed bridge is floated into position. Thanks to the combination of trusses and pontoons, the deformations under expected loadings are reduced considerately. Structurally the pontoons can be considered as flexible supports for the trussed bridge, spanning between the river banks...|$|R

5000|$|Given {{the unusual}} {{nature of this}} kick, it's arguable {{whether or not this}} move is a variant of the Double Leg or of another trick. It does however share similar {{mechanics}} to a Double Leg. This move was popularized and {{for all intents and purposes}} created by Kim Do Nguyen. It starts out very similar to a Double leg in that the take off is done with both legs and the initial torque of the trick is similar too. Once the body is in the air, it lays more horizontally and both legs will kick outwards like a [...] "V". The kick out is done at the peak height to create a stall in the momentum and gives the <b>temporary</b> appearance of <b>floating</b> in mid-trick. The longer the legs are held in the kick position, the longer the stall. The legs are then brought back in to regain the lost momentum and to help reposition the body for a safe land. Kim Do Nguyen would normally land this trick into a kneeling position but others have landed this on both feet by cutting the stall shorter.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to review and introduce R&D strategy, progress and plan focused on marine geological storage in Republic of Korea. Marine geological storage of CO 2 is to transport and to store CO 2 captured from major point sources into the offshore geologic formations. The present project focused on an investigation into potential CO 2 storage in the Korean continental shelves. This technology development plan is to meet Korean Government's CCS demonstration plan to explore and secure the CO 2 storage sites which have > 1 MtCO 2 /year capacity in 2015 and to start CO 2 injection of > 1 MtCO 2 /year in 2017. We have carried out comprehensive R&D project on CO 2 storage in marine geological formations since 2005. From 2011, core technologies related to the demonstration of CO 2 offshore geological storage have been developed. Under this multidisciplinary project, our research topics can be categorized into 4 parts: 1) screening, selection and characterization of storage sites, and development of DB (especially focused on the offshore sediments), 2) design of offshore transport infrastructure including CO 2 pipeline, carrier and <b>floating</b> <b>temporary</b> storage, 3) development of technologies for CO 2 leak prevention during the transport, injection and storage processes, and 4) modeling and monitoring of subsurface CO 2 behavior, and establishment of marine environmental monitoring and management framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{deep sea}} or <b>temporary</b> application, the <b>floating</b> {{breakwater}} should be best used to attenuate the surface wave. But the most difficulty of floating breakwater is to decrease long wave length wave. Bragg resonance condition appears while incident surface water wavelengths are approximately twice the periodic structure wavelengths, and {{large amounts of}} incident wave energy are reflected. In recent years, flexible membrane structure, with its numerous advantages, has {{attracted the attention of}} the coastal and ocean engineers and researchers. Although Bragg resonance is investigated by using diffirent analytical methods, it is not found by using CFD method. Therefore, in this paper, we use commercial software code FLUENT to numerical simulating the interaction of surface grivaty wave with multiple veitically fixed membranes with constant gaps. At the beginning, we verified the numerical technology by simulating the wave making and the interaction of wave with single membrane; then, we computed 4 diffirent length veitically fixed multiple membranes. The results show that the transmission coefficient is small and decline obviously with the membrane lengthened when incident surface water wavelengths are approximately twice the membrane gap. However, we need to simulate more wave lengthes to find whether there is the strong reflection induced by Bragg resonance. The works in this paper are the base about more studies on Bragg resonance being applied to floating breakwater...|$|R

50|$|In winter 955, Guo Rong {{launched}} a major attack on Later Zhou's southeastern neighbor Southern Tang (the successor state to Wu).

Li and Wang crossed the Huai at Zhengyang by means of a <b>temporary</b> <b>floating</b> bridge, and put Shou Prefecture under siege. However, even though the Later Zhou army scored several victories against Southern Tang forces, Li was unable to capture Shou quickly. In spring 956, fearful that the Southern Tang general Liu Yanzhen (劉彥貞) would destroy the bridge and leave the Later Zhou army with no means to retreat, he decided to withdraw back north of the Huai and await Guo, who had decided to lead an army himself to join the attack by that point, as well as the major general Li Chongjin (Guo's cousin). Li's withdrawal drew disapproval from Guo, but turned out to work well for Later Zhou — as Liu believed it to be a sign of weakness and decided to prepare to attack the Later Zhou army, despite the dissuasions by Southern Tang's defender of Shou, Liu Renzhan (劉仁瞻). When Li Chongjin subsequently arrived and engaged Liu Yanzhen, Liu Yanzhen's army was crushed — Liu Yanzhen himself was killed, and several of his subordinate generals were captured. Guo subsequently had Li Chongjin replace Li Gu as the overall commander of the operations, while making Li Gu the acting governor of Shou, apparently having Li Gu overseeing the subsequent reinitiating of the siege against Shou.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince December 2015, a {{new steel}} bridge spans the Danube River in Bratislava {{in place of}} the Old Bridge which was {{disassembled}} in 2014. A detail design and construction of the bridge is described in the article. The bridge carries trams, pedestrians and cyclists. The bridge has also been designed for future use of tram-trains. It crosses the Danube River with a navigation clearance of 100 m by 10 m and both embankments. The bridge has spans 32. 56 + 106. 68 + 137. 16 + 75. 6 + 75. 92 + 32. 56 m. The superstructure is formed by two steel lattice girders of the total height of 11. 285 m in the distance of 11 m. The rails rests on longitudinal stringers supported by truss cross girders which are overhanging outside the main girders in order to support pedestrians and cycle path as well. The standard deck width of 22. 25 m is enlarged above river piers by observatory platforms to the total width of 33. 25 m. Old piers 2, 5, 6, 7 dated from 1890 have been reconstructed. They are formed by original stone masonry walls with concrete core. Piers 3 and 4 were completely demolished and have been replaced by a new pier 34. The superstructure was incrementally launched into its final position supported by piers and a <b>temporary</b> <b>floating</b> support which was used for the main spans of 106. 68 and 137. 16 m in the Danube River. The movement of the floating support was provided by the launched bridge.

During the launching, both the bridge and the floating support were carefully monitored. A comparison of theoretical assumptions and measured values are presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Ageing {{pressure}} {{is considered to}} be a critical subject to the pension system in its own right and a vast amount has been written under this heading. This paper s empirical section is based on two datasets: one is the 2001 ' Shanghai Fifth National Population Census (SFNPC); the other is the 1990 's Shanghai Floating Population Census (SFPC). My main aim here is trying to project & test: under current rapid migration, is so called replacement migration a feasible solution to sharply declining and ageing China urban population? Also from the replacement migration point of view, my paper briefly analyzes how China's urban pension system would react in the future. Some concepts that will frequently be used in this paper are defined as follows. The "Floating Population"(FP) here refers to the people who temporally or permanently live in urban (i. e. Shanghai), but without "residence permit"(in Chinese, which called "Hukou"). In general, the floating population can't benefit from the pension system sponsored by the government, but should pay tax just as same as what urban residents do under current "Floating Population Regulation". According to some specific standards, we could divide the FP into two subgroups, one is the People who just temporally live in urban (<b>Temporary</b> <b>Floating</b> Population or TFP), and the other is the ones who permanently live in urban (Permanent Floating Population or PFP). The analyses begin with an interesting contradiction. According to some former population projections from the 1990 s, Shanghai should have experienced a rapid ageing, and such trend should continue until 2030 s when it reaches its peak. But, in fact, according to 2001 ' Fifth National Population Census (note 1), the ratio of dependency (60 +) seems to remain constant (maybe even decline) compared with that of the 1990 s. What is the explanation? The answer is simple! All the Shanghai population projections so far are based on the assumption that the migration is strictly & perfectly controlled, and that it has an insignificant effect on Shanghai's population variation (note 2). Now, we can see that this is an extremely unrealistic assumption. Meanwhile, I should point out, that there were no data about the FP, especially about the PFR, before the Fifth National Population Census (FNPC). This greatly limited the related empirical research. The basic idea of my thesis is below. Previous related research was always based on the assumption of a closed population; intuitively, such precondition is too unrealistic due to last ten years migration. At present, it is possible & necessary to include the factor of migration into population projections. Furthermore, from this point of view, almost all urban economic indexes (such as the GDP per capita, etc; and in some popular pension models, for example in RMSM (Revised Minimum Standard Model) model developed by World Bank, these per-capita-indexes are crucial and sensitive to final conclusion) need carefully revised when we realize the FP s significant effect. In this paper, I will firstly attempt to estimate the level of FP, and then use FP-adjusted data to test & re-estimate some popular belief about the Chinese urban pension system under a general theoretical analysis framework. 1. The best important feature of 2001 Fifth National Population Census is that the FP who have continually lived somewhere other than hometown for 6 months or above should participate the current-lived place s registration. Formerly, all FP need go back hometown attend census. To some extend, this adjustment of census policy also reflect the significant fact that there are great migration from rural to city take place during last decade. 2. Before the economic reform, legal migration in China required removal certificates from place of origin, documentation of job offers, etc, and in fact the policy of forced rustication stopped the possibility of migrating from rural areas to the city...|$|E
