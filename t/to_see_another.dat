25|$|When Tarmo {{returned}} to Tallinn, her crew was surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> large icebreaker flying the Finnish flag moored at the harbour. The Soviet icebreaker Volynets {{had been captured}} only two days earlier and renamed Wäinämöinen. Both ships were used to transport 3,000 German soldiers — Detachment Brandenstein — to Loviisa. On 18 April 1918, Tarmo arrived in Helsinki and was handed back to the Finnish Board of Navigation.|$|E
25|$|According to Henry, {{life can}} never {{be seen from the}} exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and {{experiences}} itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world we never see life itself, but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them. In the same way, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> person's soul with the eyes or to perceive it {{at the end of a}} scalpel.|$|E

25|$|On March 27, 1733, {{the king}} {{appointed}} Benavides {{governor of the}} province of Veracruz and the Castle of San Juan de Ulúa, Mexico. The Floridanos were generally dismayed when the news reached Florida, as they did not expect <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> governor like Benavides. He continued the same policies he had implemented there at his new post, and practiced his accustomed charity, devoting much of his income to the poor people of Veracruz, {{just as he had}} done in St. Augustine.|$|E
25|$|While {{both areas}} are {{designated}} wilderness areas, Quetico Provincial Park is often {{considered to be}} more remote and challenging than the Boundary Waters. The Boundary Waters also receives far more visitors than the Quetico. It {{is not unusual for}} crews not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> person for several days in the Quetico. Whereas the Boundary Waters' portage trails are generally well maintained, Quetico's trails are often unmaintained. This means that in Quetico there are no boardwalks as there are in the BWCAW for swampy portages, and there are fewer park wardens clearing the trails of fallen timber and debris.|$|E
25|$|The new {{government}}, the Directory, had {{no desire}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> rival government appear in the Hôtel-de-Ville. On 11 October 1795, the Directory changed the status of Paris from an independent department to a canton of the Department of the Seine. The post of mayor was abolished, and the city was henceforth governed by the five administrators of the Department of the Seine. The city was divided into twelve municipalities subordinate {{to the government of}} the Department. Each municipality was governed by seven administrators named by the heads of the Department. Paris did not have its own elected Mayor again until 1977.|$|E

You {{could argue that the}} film isn’t really about the Holocaust, but about the {{generation}} that grew up in its shadow, which is what the book insists. But the film is neither about the Holocaust nor about those Germans who grappled with its legacy: it's about making the audience feel good about a historical catastrophe that grows fainter with each new tasteful interpolation.|$|E

Thinking he was somehow in his own future he was confused <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> Superboy and fought him until coming to realize that something bigger was going on. After talking {{it out with the}} modern Superboy the Pocket Universe Superboy vanished back to his proper time and reality. This Superboy was later retconned to have been the Earth-One Superboy.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, no formal {{exception}} {{was made for}} Lou Gehrig (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so {{he would have been}} eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was terminally ill, making it uncertain that he would live long enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.|$|E

They made their way back after dark and were picked up by troops of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. During debriefing Cloudsley-Thompson said that he [...] "never wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> tank as long as [...] lived" [...] but the British press reported this as: [...] "The first thing the five tank men asked for was another tank". Because the British had lost contact with the forces on Point 213 and withdrawn from Villers-Bocage, they were ignorant of the losses on both sides. The German propaganda machine swiftly credited Wittmann, a household name in Germany, with all the British tanks destroyed at Villers-Bocage.|$|E

SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall praised Joshua Jackson and Lance Reddick's performances, giving Jackson [...] "top honors" [...] as he [...] "once again shows us the fangs behind that cherubic smile". Stegall also noted the allusions to The X-Files, which included an episode playing during the first shapeshifter's transformation, [...] "Which is fine, as far as I'm concerned. If I can't have Mulder and Scully, I'll take Walter and Peter, and even Astrid and Charlie...

After the makers of Eragon cast Sienna Guillory, Frankel called her in the bathroom of [...] "some dive club" [...] in London, where she was consoling herself with her sister. He told her that while he would have cast her just from the tape, the studio wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> audition with her dressed more in character. She insisted on continuing to play the character as British; Both Hathaway and Emily Blunt lost weight for their roles, with Hathaway later recounting that [...] " [...] and I would clutch at each other and cry because we were so hungry."

[...] Horowitz also enjoyed the juxtaposition of Juliet's character development with the revelations on the [...] "freighter folk". [...] Kitsis picked the episode's final scene where Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) discover that Ben has negotiated his release and will be dining with them that evening as his favorite of the episode.

[...] Having watched the film at Sundance, David Rooney from Variety praised several of the actors' performances and said the film [...] "should score with kids the protagonists' age, but its soap-opera-style plotting and overwritten dialogue will limit wider acceptance". Premiere also gave a negative review of the film's debut, commenting that audiences had been expecting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>another</b> Shine, though left the screening disappointed. Elfick acknowledged that the initial screening of Blackrock at Sundance was less well received, which he blamed on sound problems. He stated that the issue was rectified for {{the second and third}} screenings, which were much more successful. Diane Carmen of The Denver Post gave the film a positive review of the film, which she said left audiences at Sundance [...] "reeling with its intensity", concluding it was [...] "almost guaranteed to find a distributor in the U.S", though in the event the film never received American distribution. Having viewed the film at the Boston Film Festival, Chris Wright from The Phoenix concluded, [...] "Even with its slightly over-the-top dénouement, Blackrock is a believable, touching teen drama. It's also a gripping thriller".|$|E
