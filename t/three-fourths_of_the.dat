5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part of the tomb was installed.

To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons or things to be seized. It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E

5|$|The large incisor is {{inclined}} forward, and its rootthe {{only part of}} the tooth that is preservedforms an angle of about 55° with the horizontal. At the tip of the alveolus, where the tooth projects out of the bone, it is 3.0mm (0.12 in) high and 2.1mm broad. The root extends through the dentary to a position below the third cheektooth. Only the roots of the first and second cheekteeth are preserved. Both are about 1.5mm in diameter, but the first tooth may have been slightly smaller than the second. The third tooth, the largest of the cheekteeth, has the root slightly curved backward. This root is deeply anchored in the dentary, extending down through about <b>three-fourths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone. The crown is preserved {{in the form of a}} stump of dentine, 2.3mm (0.091 in) long and 1.9mm (0.075 in) broad, that extends high above the dentary, indicating that the tooth was hypsodont (high-crowned). High dentine stumps also remain of the fourth and fifth cheekteeth. The fourth is about as large as the first and second and the fifth is smaller, with a diameter of about 1.0mm (0.039 in). The fourth cheektooth also has a long, curved root, which extends more than halfway through the dentary, and that of the fifth tooth is even smaller and shorter. The orientation of the roots and teeth indicates that all the teeth were single-rooted.|$|E
