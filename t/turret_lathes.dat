25|$|In April 1889 Hartness {{moved to}} Springfield, Vermont {{to become the}} {{superintendent}} at the struggling Jones and Lamson (J) Machine Company. He used his creative energy to revitalize the company. Here he found his chance to manufacture the flat-turret lathe, which increased efficiency and productivity and was especially well adapted to the burgeoning automobile industry. The flat turret lathe improved upon earlier <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> via greater rigidity, allowing higher precision, higher speeds and feeds, and longer cuts. Hartness also developed an array of highly advanced tooling to complement the lathe, including improved roller bar feed and die head designs. All of these advantages allowed better parts to be made faster, and thus less expensively, which made the lathe highly desirable to manufacturers. This time, Hartness was prepared to defend his interest in his patent. He arranged with J to receive a $100 royalty on each machine.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} main types of thread rolling, {{named after the}} {{configuration}} of the dies: flat dies, two-die cylindrical, three-die cylindrical, and planetary dies. The flat die system has two flat dies. The bottom one is held stationary and the other slides. The blank is placed {{on one end of the}} stationary die and then the moving die slides over the blank, which causes the blank to roll between the two dies forming the threads. Before the moving die reaches the end of its stroke the blank rolls off the stationary die in a finished form. The two-die cylindrical process is used to produce threads up to [...] in diameter and [...] in length. There are two types of three-die processes; the first has the three dies move radially out from the center to let the blank enter the dies and then closes and rotates to roll the threads. This type of process is commonly employed on <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> and screw machines. The second type takes the form of a self-opening die head. This type is more common than the former, but is limited by not being able form the last 1.5 to 2 threads against shoulders. Planetary dies are used to mass-produce threads up to [...] in diameter.|$|E

25|$|Hartness {{discouraged}} modernizing of the Hartness Flat <b>Turret</b> <b>Lathe.</b> Nevertheless, {{it remained}} {{a very successful}} product until after Hartness's retirement, when a new J <b>turret</b> <b>lathe</b> model by John Lovely finally replaced it.|$|R
50|$|Also a {{successful}} inventor, Potter was granted several patents, including a Stripping Mechanism for Carding-Machines (filed 27 Feb 1885), the <b>Turret</b> <b>Lathe</b> (filed 27 March 1905) and the Automatic <b>Turret</b> <b>Lathe</b> (filed 11 Mar 1919).|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes {{machines}} {{similar to}} those above, but with power feeds and automatic turret-indexing {{at the end of}} the return stroke, are called [...] "semi-automatic turret lathes". This nomenclature distinction is blurry and not consistently observed. The term [...] "turret lathe" [...] encompasses them all. During the 1860s, when semi-automatic <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> were developed, they were sometimes called [...] "automatic". What we today would call [...] "automatics", that is, fully automatic machines, had not been developed yet. During that era both manual and semi-automatic <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> were sometimes called [...] "screw machines", although we today reserve that term for fully automatic machines.|$|E

50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret lathes (bench lathes, engine lathes, toolroom lathes, etc.) by {{mounting}} them on the toolpost, tailstock, or both.

50|$|There is a {{tremendous}} variety of <b>turret</b> <b>lathe</b> and capstan lathe designs, reflecting the variety of work that they do.|$|R
50|$|From the late-19th through mid-20th centuries, <b>turret</b> <b>lathes,</b> both {{manual and}} {{automatic}} (i.e., screw machines and chuckers), {{were one of}} the most important classes of machine tools for mass production. They were used extensively in the mass production for the war effort in World War II.|$|E
5000|$|By April 1, 1917, the {{machinery}} and tools were purchased by H. A. Smith Manufacturing Company who {{put them on}} the market as a [...] "good assortment" [...] of lathes, drills, milling machines, grinders, <b>turret</b> <b>lathes,</b> chucks, vises and small tools and leather belting for [...] "immediate delivery." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hollow milling cutters, {{more often}} called simply hollow mills, are {{essentially}} [...] "inside-out endmills". They are {{shaped like a}} piece of pipe (but with thicker walls), with their cutting edges on the inside surface. They are used on <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> and screw machines as an alternative to turning with a box tool, or on milling machines or drill presses to finish a cylindrical boss (such as a trunnion).|$|E

5000|$|The first <b>turret</b> <b>lathe</b> {{was invented}} by Stephen Fitch in 1845.The archetypical <b>turret</b> <b>lathe,</b> and the first in order of {{historical}} appearance, is the horizontal-bed, manual <b>turret</b> <b>lathe.</b> The term [...] "turret lathe" [...] without further qualification is still understood to refer to this type. The formative decades for this class of machine were the 1840s through 1860s, when the basic idea of mounting an indexable turret on a bench lathe or engine lathe was born, developed, and disseminated from the originating shops to many other factories. Some important tool-builders in this development were Stephen Fitch; Gay, Silver & Co.; Elisha K. Root of Colt; J.D. Alvord of the Sharps Armory; Frederick W. Howe, Richard S. Lawrence, and Henry D. Stone of Robbins & Lawrence; J.R. Brown of Brown & Sharpe; and Francis A. Pratt of Pratt & Whitney. Various designers at these and other firms later made further refinements.|$|R
5|$|As {{president}} of J, Flanders implemented a continuous production line to manufacture the Hartness <b>Turret</b> <b>Lathe</b> instead of building each machine individually, attempting {{to bring some}} of the efficiencies of mass production to machine tool building.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "monitor lathe" [...] {{formerly}} (1860s-1940s) {{referred to}} the class of small- to medium-sized manual <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> used on relatively small work. The name {{was inspired by the}} monitor-class warships, which the monitor lathe's turret resembled. Today, lathes of such appearance, such as the Hardinge DSM-59 and its many clones, are still common, but the name [...] "monitor lathe" [...] is no longer current in the industry.|$|E
50|$|Hollow-hexagon <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> {{competed with}} flat-turret lathes {{by taking the}} {{conventional}} hexagon turret and making it hollow, allowing the part to pass into it during the cut, analogously to how the part would pass over the flat turret. In both cases, the main idea is to increase rigidity by allowing a relatively long part to be turned without the tool overhang that would be needed with a conventional turret, which is not flat or hollow.|$|E
50|$|Other {{applications}} of the Geneva drive include the pen change mechanism in plotters, automated sampling devices, banknote counting machines, and many forms of indexable equipment used in manufacturing (such as the tool changers in CNC machines; the turrets of <b>turret</b> <b>lathes,</b> screw machines, and turret drills; some kinds of indexing heads and rotary tables; and so on). The Iron Ring Clock uses a Geneva mechanism to provide intermittent motion to one of its rings.|$|E
50|$|The American {{development}} of the <b>turret</b> <b>lathe</b> (1840s) and of automatic screw machines derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of the <b>turret</b> <b>lathe.</b> They can be most generally classified by size (small, medium, or large); {{method of control}} (manual, automated mechanically, or automated via computer (numerical control (NC) or computer numerical control (CNC)); and bed orientation (horizontal or vertical).|$|R
25|$|The 1921 {{edition of}} the ASME {{mechanical}} catalog and directory showed that J offered several models of Hartness flat <b>turret</b> <b>lathe,</b> an automatic chucking lathe, an automatic die, a screw-thread comparator, and the Fay automatic lathe. J had offices in Springfield, Vermont, San Francisco, California, and London, England, plus agents in five other countries.|$|R
