5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to <b>their</b> <b>corresponding</b> phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} <b>their</b> <b>corresponding</b> phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E

GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3− anion.

They {{can also be}} doped between the C60 molecules in the fullerene solid, rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors – the most recent class of high-temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56K, which is the highest value achieved so far in this series.|$|E

At the first leg, from the shore, castaways would run to a mudpit, where they would find <b>their</b> own paddle, <b>corresponding</b> <b>their</b> tribe color.

Using their paddle and hands, they would find three rope rings in <b>their</b> designated sandpile <b>corresponding</b> <b>their</b> tribe color. Once they found one, they would shoot it at their basket using the paddle. One member from each tribe who finds the three rope rings first would advance to the last leg. At the last leg, from their tribe mat, they would shoot each rope ring to a pole with hoops for each ring. Whoever shot all the rope rings first wins reward for their tribe.|$|R

5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than <b>their</b> <b>corresponding</b> rhodocenes.|$|E
5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to <b>their</b> <b>corresponding</b> diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E
