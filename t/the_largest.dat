40|$|Homeopathy {{contends that}} higher dilutions {{of the active}} {{ingredient}} in a remedy (fewer molecules in each dose) produce stronger medical effects [1]. This idea is inconsistent with observed dose-response relationships of conventional drugs, where the effects increase with the concentration of the active ingredient in the body [2]. The conventional dose-response relationship {{has been found in}} numerous scientific studies on organisms as diverse as nematodes [3], rats [4], and humans [5]. Further it is consistent with the behavior of simple physical and chemical systems,-e. g. <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> force on a spring, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> displacement (Hooke’s law), or <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> voltage on a resistor, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> current (Ohm’s law), and <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> concentration difference within a solution, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> particle flux (Fick’s law), <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> temperature difference on a solid <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> heat flow, and so on. The dose-response relationship describes the changes in an organism caused by different levels of exposure (or doses) of a stressor (typically a chemical, heat, radiation, or a force). The dose-response relationship quantifies the response of an individual (e. g. small dose has no observable effect, large dose is fatal) or the response of a population (e. g. how many patients a cured at different levels of exposure).
