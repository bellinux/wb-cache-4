5|$|Recent {{performances}} often set {{the play}} in <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world.</b> For example, in 1986, the Royal Shakespeare Company set the play in modern Verona. Switchblades replaced swords, feasts and balls became drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo committed suicide by hypodermic needle. In 1997, the Folger Shakespeare Theatre produced a version {{set in a}} typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt's death while in class at school.|$|E
5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange. Peter then states that it is no {{stranger}} than when Darth Vader from the film franchise Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world</b> as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E
40|$|Having {{as subject}} {{the labor market}} {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems, this paper aims to make a {{theoretical}} and practical presentation of these concepts, which are relevant for the national and international literature. The first part, dealing with the state-of-the-art of the domain, aims to present these concepts from the perspective of many specialists in this field. The practical part of this article consists in a research based on the presentation of the labor market under the impact of <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems. To support our line of reasoning, in our scientific approach we used a research based on the analysis of secondary sources, and as quantitative methods, we used: the simple linear regression and the public opinion poll. Among <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> issues analyzed using the quantitative methods were: juvenile delinquency, violence against other peoples and population’s poverty rate. The hypothesis of this paper starts from the premise according to which lack of education generates intensification of <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems, especially juvenile delinquency and poverty rate, these two having an impact upon the employment rate of the labor market, because potentially active people are convicted when referring to people above 18 years old and in special educational institutions when referring to people under 18. The most relevant conclusions of the research highlight the fact that between the labor market and <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems there is interdependence, and not giving the appropriate importance to <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> issues will generate irremediable difficulties in society...|$|R

25|$|Irving and Blau were insistent idealists who {{developed}} the Workshop {{in the tradition of}} the Group Theatre of the 1930s; they and key company members were dedicated to principles of social responsibility and ensemble artistry.

25|$|Ibn Taymiyyah's works {{served as}} an {{inspiration}} for later Muslim scholars and historical figures, who have been regarded as his admirers or disciples. In <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world,</b> he may be considered {{at the root of}} Wahhabism, the Senussi order and other later reformist movements. Ibn Taymiyyah has been noted to have influenced Rashid Rida, Abul A`la Maududi, Sayyid Qutb, Hassan al-Banna, Abdullah Azzam, and Osama bin Laden. The terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant used a fatwa of Ibn Taymiyyah to justify the burning alive of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} {{languages of}} the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural {{product of the}} Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the international lingua franca in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into the Romance languages and Ancient Greek into Modern Greek and its dialects. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of Latin and Greek is notable. Ecclesiastical Latin, the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|Protestantism {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic {{religious}} movements in <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world.</b> From 1960 to 2000, the global growth of the number of reported Evangelicals grew three times the world's population rate, and twice that of Islam. Evangelical Christian denominations also are among the fastest-growing denominations in some Catholic Christian countries, such as Brazil and France. In Brazil, the total number of Protestants jumped from 16.2% in 2000 to 22.2% in 2010 (for the first time, the percentage of Catholics in Brazil is less than 70%). These cases don't contribute to a growth of Christianity overall, but rather to a substitution of a brand of Christianity with another one.|$|E
25|$|According to Mark Jürgensmeyer of the University of California, popular Protestantism {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic {{religious}} movements in <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> <b>world.</b> Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant. Since 1900, due primarily to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion. Much of the growth has occurred after World War II, when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred. According to one source, Protestants constituted respectively 2.5%, 2%, 0.5% of Latin Americans, Africans and Asians. In 2000, percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17%, more than 27% and 5.5%, respectively.|$|E
