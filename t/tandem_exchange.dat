50|$|Holborn {{exchange}} had 9400 subscribers (lines) and had 222 directors, each {{of which}} would on average handle 72 calls in the busy hour (BH) and be held for 20 seconds. Holborn was also a <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange</b> for calls to and from local manual exchanges, so that the tandem traffic from manual exchanges was combined with traffic from automatic exchanges. Handling local calls between manual exchanges via a third operator at a <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange</b> is uneconomic, but without tandem switching each manual exchange would require direct junctions to every other manual exchange. In London there were 73 manual exchanges within 10 mi of Oxford Circus, of which twennty had CCI (Coded-Call Indicator) equipment which displayed the number dialled to the local manual exchange operator, and the rest were to be equipped shortly.|$|E
50|$|In the London {{telephone}} area, {{calls to}} subscribers {{who were not}} serviced by Director telephone systems within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange</b> Toll A: a subscriber would dial a prefix code, usually three letters, followed {{by the number of}} the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange. Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director exchange, subscribers were given codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number. For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the subscriber was told to dial 7, to wait for a second dialling tone, and to follow this with the whole of the other number. These calls were handled by <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange</b> Toll B, from which the second dialling tone originated. To have a second dialling tone in this way was very unusual on the PSTN in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls.|$|E
50|$|A {{central office}} might only have {{physical}} plant resources to handle ca. 8% of allocated telephone numbers, based on historical call traffic averages. A choke exchange has trunk facilities to other exchanges designed {{in a manner}} that high call volume is handled through the choke connection rather than overwhelming the rest of the local telephone network. Other local exchanges have a limited number of direct trunks (junctions) to the choke exchange, which may only serve one or more customers, such as a radio station contest line, which may experience many simultaneous calls. But instead of calls being overflowed to main or tandem routes shared with other calls, the unsuccessful callers receive a reorder tone from their local or <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange.</b> If the calls were overflowed to the tandem route, the caller would receive a busy tone from the exchange serving the radio station, and the sudden peak would disrupt calls between other customers.|$|E

40|$|Using both {{quantitative}} and qualitative methods of inquiry, this dissertation study undertakes {{an exploration of the}} dynamics of the social interaction in discourse co-constructed by pairs of college students in telecollaborative <b>tandem</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Two groups of participants, Mexican learners of English as a foreign language and American learners of Spanish as a foreign language, participated in video-based telecollaborative <b>tandem</b> <b>exchanges</b> where they worked in pairs to discuss topics assigned by their instructors, communicating half the time in Spanish and half in English. According to the principle of reciprocity in tandem learning, the participants switch between the roles of native speaker (NS) expert and non-native speaker (NNS) learner as they invest equal time, effort, and interest in each language part of the chats. Grounded in sociocultural theory (SCT) for second language acquisition (SLA), this study addresses research questions pertaining to (1) the distribution of talk between the members of each pair and between the language parts of the exchange, (2) the distribution of interactional resources deployed by the members of each pair to establish and maintain intersubjectivity and build a relationship, and (3) the individual experiences of participants regarding their positioning in and perspectives of the exchange. Addressing the three research questions allowed the researcher to look at the telecollaborative <b>tandem</b> <b>exchanges</b> from the perspectives of language production, social aspects of interaction, and individual experiences and perspectives to gather {{a deeper understanding of the}} tandem context. The analysis of three data sources—survey responses, chat transcripts from one chat of the semester-long telecollaborative tandem project, and post-project participant interviews—shows that the principle of reciprocity posited by tandem theorists as equal time, effort, and interest in each language part underestimates the complexity of the construct as it was created by the participants in the telecollaborative tandem interactions examined in this dissertation study. A mixed methods approach allowed the researcher to deconstruct and reconsider the construct of reciprocity in telecollaborative tandem learning. The telecollaborative <b>tandem</b> <b>exchanges</b> examined in this study were not reciprocal between language parts of the exchange in terms of language production, use of interactional resources, or tandem participant positioning. Instead, they presented complex pair relationships that used language differently in each language part to establish and maintain intersubjectivity, as well as the strong desire of the participants to position themselves and their partners as peers rather than take on the roles assumed to characterize the tandem context; that is, NS as expert and NNS as learner. In accordance with these findings, telecollaborative tandem learning should be approached with an open understanding of the concept of reciprocity in which the participants co-construct their relationship through meaningful social dialogue as peers, rather than through the roles of NS expert and NNS learner. Based on the findings of this study, the expert–learner model of reciprocity may be too rigid and too static for the dynamic context of telecollaborative tandem learning...|$|R
50|$|The first code {{selectors}} had {{levels for}} local exchange calls and {{calls to the}} local <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange.</b> An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code selection stage on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third selection stages. But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes {{should be on the}} first code selectors and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third selection stage. Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code selector groups, (B) two second and one third code selector groups, and (C) one second and two third code selector groups. The number of switches for the hypothetical traffic distribution is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower levels on the selectors to minimise setting-up time and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.|$|E

The central office (CO) is connected to the <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange</b> (TE). In some cases, COs are connected by the directly. Such possibility is shown by the dotted lines for three COs connected to the TEIII. COs may be directly connected with the toll exchange. This option is shown by the dotted line for the COII1. Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX) is served by the nearest CO. All TEs are forming the meshed network. Up to the 1990s, TE was independent element of the local network. Operators did not use the equipment combined functions Tandem and Toll Exchanges. So, TE provided connections between COs of the local network, and access to the toll exchange. A function of the toll exchange is to establish connections for the long-distance and international calls. Last type of calls is served by the Gateway (GW). Processing of the local calls is performed by the COs and TEs. If a subscriber dials digit [...] "8" [...] (prefix of the long-distance connection in the national PSTN) all further processing of the call is a function of a toll exchange. The numbering plan for the cellular networks based on the Area Code (three digits) and number of mobile terminal (seven digits). In this case, the Area Code defines the concrete cellular network.|$|E
50|$|The first UK public {{automatic}} exchange {{was brought into}} service at Epsom, Surrey, in May 1912 using the American Strowger ‘step-by-step’ system. It allowed subscribers to dial the local number themselves (instead of asking the operator to connect them manually). A permanent “junction telephone service” was inaugurated between Liverpool and Manchester during 1914. In 1922 the practice of using the first three letters of an exchange name was introduced in London, Manchester and Birmingham in preparation for automatic dialing. By 1924 there were {{over a quarter of}} million lines connected to more than 40 {{automatic exchange}}s. The main problem in large cities was directing a call over a complex series of interlinking circuits. The first fully automatic system in a large urban area was under an advanced form of the Strowger concept (which enabled one exchange to be connected automatically to another). Called the Director telephone system, this was first tried on a large scale in London’s Holborn <b>Tandem</b> <b>exchange</b> in 1927. The concept was envisaged to be effective for many major built-up areas and the first three exchanges outside London to be ‘cut-over’ to the automatic Director system were: Ardwick, Collyhurst and Moss Side in Manchester during 1930. The exchanges covering the city centre and some suburbs with 7 and a half miles were progressively converted to the same system during the next few years. The automation process meant {{that a large number of}} mainly female telephone operators in the Manchester exchanges became redundant - a crisis that was mentioned in Parliament in 1933. But it had revolutionised call-making across the city. For example, subscribers in Collyhurst and Moss Side were then able to dial the letters A (=2), R (=7) and D (=3) followed by the four digit Ardwick subscribers number to connect them directly without talking with an operator. (3 exchanges in Birmingham were next, in 1931, one in Glasgow in 1937, one in Liverpool in 1941, Edinburgh’s automatic system did not start until 1950). By the time the system was superseded in 1966, there were around 50 three-letter exchange name codes in the Manchester Automatic System (list inside a telephone drawer, pictured), more than in any other director area outside the capital.|$|E

Customer stations were assigned seven-digit numbers, with the first three digits spelling out the local exchange name; this expedited call handling particularly to and from manual <b>exchanges.</b> Direct or <b>tandem</b> junction routes to other exchanges could be allocated as required, with routing independent of the telephone number and able to be altered at any time to cater for traffic growth or the introduction of new local or <b>tandem</b> <b>exchanges.</b>|$|R

Strategy categories were based on Oxford’s (1990) groupings, adapted to fit a collaborative online context. Of the conventional language learning strategies identified by Oxford, social strategies are most in evidence.

40|$|One of {{the issues}} that has been debated in the context of fairly open {{learning}} partnerships such as tandem learning has been whether and, if so, how much pedagogical support should be provided. Another issue is how do language learners who have grown accustomed to maximising their learning through comprehensible input and output make the transition to a reciprocal learning partnership where they are supposed to switch between the roles of learner and expert or resource. The three principles behind tandem learning are bilingualism; reciprocity; and learner autonomy. At Trinity College Dublin we have conducted extensive research into tandem learning in object-oriented Multiple User Domains (MOOs) since 1998. Of the three tandem principles, we found that balanced bilingualism, where both languages are used equally in the exchange, is difficult to achieve, particularly though not surprisingly in partnerships where L 2 proficiency differs substantially. We think that technology, at least in MOOs, can contribute towards a solution to the problem. The bilingual tandem analyser (BTA) analyses MOO input while users are communicating and gives feedback to learners (and possibly teachers) on bilingualism in the exchange. Here, we discuss what attitudes towards bilingualism learners bring towards the <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange</b> and how they react to the BTA as a tool to monitor and regulate bilingualism: will learners perceive balanced bilingualism as a necessary principle of the partnership; what efforts do they make to keep the balance between the languages; how do they see the BTA: as an instrument of control, directed by the teacher; or do they perceive it as a useful tool to support their tandem exchanges...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has three}} interrelated aims: (1) to {{elaborate}} {{a model of}} instructed second language acquisition (SLA) that brings together insights from cognitive research in second language acquisition and from the developmental and learning theories of Lev Vygotsky; (2) to identify the pedagogical implications of this model; and (3) to evaluate this pedagogy as implemented in a computer-mediated communication (CMC) environment. Chapter 1 critically assesses existing Vygotskian second language research and concludes that much {{of this research is}} based on an inadequate understanding of Vygotsky?s theory. More emphasis should be given to the individual-cognitive dimension of Vygotskian theory: the role of consciousness is crucial, providing an important point of interface with mainstream SLA research. Chapter 2 reviews the literature on the role of consciousness in SLA, and especially Schmidt?s noticing hypothesis and Truscott?s critique thereof. Karmiloff-Smith?s model of representational redescription in cognitive development forms the basis of the model of instructed SLA, which incorporates insights from the discussions of Vygotsky and noticing. Metalinguistic knowledge emerges as playing important roles in language use and learning. Chapter 3 draws out the pedagogical implications of the model and suggests that tandem language learning (an exchange involving bilingual learning partnerships) and engagement with written language have important roles to play in any implementation of this pedagogy. It further assesses the benefits that CMC, and specifically a system known as a MOO (Multiple User Domain, Object-Oriented), might bring to such an implementation. Chapters 4 and 5 contain an empirical study of tandem learning in the MOO, based on data from a German-Irish <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange.</b> Chapter 4 sets out the institutional and pedagogical context and analyses preliminary data relating to participation, interaction and language balance. Chapter 5 focuses on the substantive questions of metalinguistic behaviour and processes. MOO session transcripts are analysed under the headings of negotiation of meaning, self-repair, and other-correction, and the success of a prescribed writing/peer-reformulation task in generating metalinguistic dialogue is evaluated. On the basis of online interview data, tentative conclusions are drawn concerning the metacognitive processes that take place in the MOO interaction. The study cannot claim to have shown that interacting in a MOO brings with it automatic benefits in the form of metalinguistic processes. Rather, the evidence leads us to the replacement of a simple causal model of the relationship between communications medium and metalinguistic process with a three-part model of compulsions, affordances and potentials for metalinguistic reflection. This model should be applicable also to other applications of computer technology to language learning. The value of the tandem learning framework is clear, but it is essential to match partners as closely as possible in terms of language proficiency...|$|E
50|$|Each local {{exchange}} incorporated {{up to eight}} groups of directors which translated the first three digits (ABC digits) comprising the exchange name into a pulse train of one to six digits, as required for each exchange and unique to that exchange. The translated digits {{were sent to the}} code selectors, and then the four numeric digits were sent to three switching stages in the terminating exchange (two group selectors and a final selector). Hence local calls within the exchange and busy direct junction routes to exchanges with high traffic from that exchange could be trunked via one code selection stage, which reduced both the setting-up time and the total numbers of selectors required in the network. Distant exchanges which did not justify direct junction routes could be called via one or more tandem exchanges; being routed via one, two or three local code selectors in the originating exchange, one or more selectors in the <b>tandem</b> <b>exchange(s),</b> and finally the numeric selection stages in the terminating exchange for the last four digits, which were stored and forwarded without translation.|$|R

40|$|Deactivation of glutamatergic {{signaling}} in {{the brain}} is mediated by glutamate uptake into glia and neurons by glutamate transporters. Glutamate transporters are sodium-dependent proteins that putatively rely indirectly on Na,K-ATPases to generate ion gradients that drive transmitter uptake. Based on anatomical colocalization,mutual sodiumdependency, and the inhibitory effects of theNa,K-ATPase inhibitor ouabain on glutamate transporter activity, we postulated that glutamate transporters are directly coupled to Na,K-ATPase and that Na,K-ATPase is an essential modulator of glutamate uptake. Na,K-ATPase was purified from rat cerebellum by <b>tandem</b> anion <b>exchange</b> and ouabain affinity chromatography, and the cohort of associated proteins was characterized bymass spectrometry. The 1 – 3 subunits of Na,K-ATPase were detected, as were the glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT- 1, demonstrating that glutamate transporters copurify with Na,K-ATPases. The link between glutamate transporters and Na,K-ATPase was further established by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization. Analysis of the regulation of glutamate transporter and Na,K-ATPase activities was assessed using [3 H]D-aspartate, [3 H]L-glutamate, and rubidium- 86 uptake into synaptosomes and cultured astrocytes.

In this study, we assessed the power of neuroproteomics to contrast biochemical responses following ischemic and traumatic brain injuries in the rat. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was employed in groups of 30 -min and 2 -h focal neocortical ischemia with reperfusion. Neuroproteomes were assessed via <b>tandem</b> cation-anion <b>exchange</b> chromatography–gel electrophoresis, followed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. MCAO results were compared with those from a previous study of focal contusional brain injury employing the same methodology to characterize homologous neocortical tissues at 2 days post-injury. The 30 -min MCAO neuroproteome depicted abridged energy production involving pentose phosphate, modulated synaptic function and plasticity, and increased chaperone activity and cell survival factors. The 2 -h MCAO data indicated near complete loss of ATP production, synaptic dysfunction with degraded cytoarchitecture, more conservative chaperone activity, and additional cell survival factors than those seen in the 30 -min MCAO model. The TBI group exhibited disrupted metabolism, but with retained malate shuttle functionality. Synaptic dysfunction and cytoarchitectural degradation resembled the 2 -h MCAO group; however, chaperone and cell survival factors were more depressed following TBI.

Additionally, key documents (n= 67) were reviewed. Purposeful and theoretical sampling was used and data were collected and analyzed simultaneously. Data were compared among and between sites. Findings. The organizational elements that shape simulation in nursing (OESSN) model depicts five key organizational factors at the nursing program level that shaped the adoption and incorporation of simulation: (1) leaders working in <b>tandem,</b> (2) information <b>exchange,</b> (3) physical locale, (4) shared motivators, and (5) scaffolding to manage change. Conclusions. The OESSN model provides {{an explanation of the}} organizational factors that contributed to the adoption and incorporation of simulation into nursing curricula. Nursing programs that use the OESSN model may experience a more rapid or broad uptake of simulation when organizational factors that impact adoption and incorporation are considered and planned for...|$|R
40|$|The {{predicted}} {{structure and}} molecular trajectories from > 80 ns {{molecular dynamics simulation}} of the solvated Double-Super Helix (DSH) model of nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were determined and compared with experimental data on reconstituted nascent HDL obtained from multiple biophysical platforms, including small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast variation, hydrogen-deuterium <b>exchange</b> <b>tandem</b> mass spectrometry (H/D-MS/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), cross-linking tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR), and electron microscopy. In general, biophysical constraints experimentally derived from the multiple platforms agree with the same quantities evaluated using the simulation trajectory. Notably, key structural features postulated for the recent DSH model of nascent HDL are retained during the simulation, including (1) the superhelical conformation of the antiparallel apolipoprotein A 1 (apoA 1) chains, (2) the lipid micellar-pseudolamellar organization, and (3) the solvent-exposed Solar Flare loops, proposed sites of interaction with LCAT (lecithin cholesteryl acyltransferase). Analysis of salt bridge persistence during simulation provides insights into structural features of apoA 1 that forms {{the backbone of the}} lipoprotein. The combination of molecular dynamics simulation and experimental data from a broad range of biophysical platforms serves as a powerful approach to studying large macromolecular assemblies such as lipoproteins. This application to nascent HDL validates the DSH model proposed earlier and suggests new structural details of nascent HDL...|$|R
40|$|The DH-PH domain tandems of Dbl-homology guanine {{nucleotide}} exchange factors catalyze {{the exchange of}} GTP for GDP in Rho-family GTPases, and thus initiate {{a wide variety of}} cellular signaling cascades. Although several crystal structures of complexes of DH-PH tandems with cognate, nucleotide free Rho GTPases are known, they provide limited information about the dynamics of the complex and {{it is not clear how}} accurately they represent the structures in solution. We used a complementary combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) to study the solution structure and dynamics of the DH-PH <b>tandem</b> of RhoA-specific <b>exchange</b> factor PDZRhoGEF, both in isolation and in complex with nucleotide free RhoA. We show that in solution the DH-PH tandem behaves as a rigid entity and that the mutual disposition of the DH and PH domains remains identical within experimental error to that seen in the crystal structure of the complex, thus validating the latter as an accurate model of the complex in vivo. We also show that the nucleotide-free RhoA exhibits elevated dynamics when in complex with DH-PH, a phenomenon not observed in the crystal structure, presumably due to the restraining effects of crystal contacts. The complex is readily and rapidly dissociated in the presence of both GDP and GTP nucleotides, with no evidence of intermediate ternary complexes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe role of {{corrective}} feedback (CF) in L 2 {{development has been}} the topic of much discussion in SLA literature (see e. g. Sheen and Ellis 2011 for a recent overview). Researchers have focused their attention on CF provided either by language teachers or by fellow L 2 learners, whereas relatively {{little is known about}} phonetic feedback offered in a non-institutional setting during peer-to-peer native/non-native interactions {{as is the case with}} tandem language learning. <b>Tandem</b> language <b>exchanges</b> represent an original learning environment, as each participant takes turns being the native and the non-native side of the dialogue. Thus, in contrast to the typical L 2 learning setting, the hierarchical structure between the participants is fluid: the expert-novice power relationship evolves as the conversation switches from one language to the other. In order to see how the distinguishing characteristics of tandem learning (such as solidarity and reciprocity) shape the process of L 2 phonetic development in their own special ways, we collected an English-French Tandem corpus as part of the SITAF project, launched at the University of Sorbonne Nouvelle-Paris 3 in October 2012. We gathered linguistic data – both video and audio recorded – from face-to-face conversational exchanges held by 21 pairs of undergraduate students, with each ‘tandem’ consisting of a native speaker of English and a native speaker of French. The dialogues and reading passages were recorded on two occasions separated by a 3 -month interval. The present paper will offer a preliminary analysis of L 2 pronunciation feedback on several renditions of the same text, given to the French speakers by their English tandem partners. The passage was produced by each French participant 3 times: (1) during the ‘monitored’ reading, which was supervised by the English-speaking partner and which led to (2) the ‘improved reading’ in the course of the 1 st recording session, and then (3) the ‘final reading’ performed 3 months later. The data will allow us to address different questions relating to the study of {{corrective feedback}}, such as:-What is corrected by the native-speaking partner? Segmental or prosodic errors? Phonemic or allophonic deviations?-When does the correction take place?-What is the corrective strategy adopted by the NS? Is it explicit correction, recast, or elicitation?-How do body gestures supplement the corrective audio input?-What is the learner’s uptake after receiving feedback?We hope that our data brings a valuable and fairly unique contribution to SLA research. Establishing which errors get corrected and how may have implications for setting priorities in L 2 pronunciation teaching...|$|R
