25|$|Both of <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> are of fairly obscure origin.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that some}} of <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> share a kanji reading (i, u, and ha), and okurigana are {{conventionally}} picked to maximize these sharings.|$|E
25|$|As of verbs, {{there was}} a large variety of native Kannada verbs. <b>These</b> <b>verbs</b> existed as verbal roots, which could be {{modified}} into conjugations, nouns etc. Many verbs existed which are now out of use. e.g. ಈ - To give; ಪೋರ್ - To fight; ಉಳ್ - To be, To possess.|$|E
5000|$|Verbs are {{preceded by}} markers {{providing}} {{information on the}} subject and the tense, aspect and mood of an action. Traditionally, <b>these</b> <b>verb</b> markers were: ...|$|R
50|$|A number {{also have}} an iterative-dispositional aspect. For a few of <b>these</b> <b>verb</b> roots, this aspect can appear in both a {{progressive}} and in a perfective form.|$|R
50|$|For some verbs, {{number is}} shown not by conjugation, but by {{suppletive}} <b>verb</b> stems. <b>These</b> <b>verb</b> stems can show number differences either {{for the subject}} or for the object.|$|R
25|$|Descriptive verbs are {{a special}} class {{that can be}} used as either verbs or adjectives. One of <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> {{followed}} by a pronoun is all that is needed to form a complete sentence in Mixtec. Descriptives are not conjugated: they always appear in the present tense. To give the same idea in the past or future tenses, a copulative verb must be used.|$|E
25|$|Inchoative verbs are intransitive, {{meaning that}} they occur without a direct object, and <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> express that their subject has {{undergone}} a certain change of state. Inchoative verbs are also known as anticausative verbs. Causative verbs are transitive, {{meaning that they}} occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.|$|E
25|$|As a {{supplement}} to this treatise he wrote a second, which he called the Kitab al-Af'al Dhawat al-Mathalain (The Book of Verbs Containing Double Letters), and in which he points out the principles governing the verbs whose second and third radicals are alike. He furnishes a list of <b>these</b> <b>verbs,</b> together with their various forms occurring in the Bible. Besides the two treatises on verbs Hayyuj wrote Kitab al-Tanqit (The Book of Punctuation). This work, probably written before his two chief treatises, {{is an attempt to}} set forth the features underlying the Masoretic use of the vowels and of the word-tone. In this work he deals chiefly with nouns, and its purpose is more of a practical than of a theoretical character.|$|E
50|$|Another {{attribute}} of verb synset relations {{is that there}} are also ordered into <b>verb</b> pairs. In <b>these</b> pairs, one <b>verb</b> necessarily entails the other in the way that massacre entails kill, and know entails believe. <b>These</b> <b>verb</b> pairs can be troponyms and their superordinates, {{as is the case in}} the first example, or they can be in completely different ontological categories, as in the case in the second example.|$|R
2500|$|The unaccusative {{hypothesis}} was {{put forward by}} David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures. <b>These</b> are unaccusative <b>verbs</b> and unergative <b>verbs.</b> <b>These</b> classes of <b>verbs</b> are defined by Perlmutter only in syntactic terms. They have the following structures underlyingly: ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{counterfactual}} conditional sentences with a {{past time}} frame, {{the condition is}} expressed using the pluperfect e.g. (s'il avait attendu, [...] "if he had waited"), and the consequence with the conditional perfect (e.g. je l'aurais vu, [...] "I would have seen him"). Again <b>these</b> <b>verb</b> forms parallel those used in English.|$|R
25|$|German {{loan words}} entered Romansh {{as early as}} the Old High German period in the Early Middle Ages, and German has {{remained}} an important source of vocabulary since. Many of these words have been in use in Romansh for long enough that German speakers no longer recognize them as German, and for morphological derivations of them to have appeared, in particular through the suffix -egiar ~ iar, as in Surs. baghegiar, sut. biagear, Surm. biagier, Put. biager, Vall. bear 'to build', derived from Middle High German bûwen. Other examples include malegiar 'to paint' (← malen), schenghegiar 'to give (a present)' (← schenken), schazegiar 'to estimate' (← schätzen), or Surs. betlegiar (sut. batlagear, Surm./Put. batlager, Vall. supetliar) 'to beg', derived from Swiss German bettle with the same meaning. Nouns derived from <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> include maletg 'painting', schenghetg 'gift', schazetg 'estimation', or bagetg 'building'. The adjective flissi 'hard-working' has given rise to the noun flissiadad 'industriousness'. The word pur has given rise to derived words such as pura 'farmwife, female farmer' or puranchel 'small-time farmer', as has buob ‘boy’ from Swiss German bueb ‘boy’, with the derivations buoba ‘girl’ and buobanaglia ‘crowd of children’.|$|E
25|$|Within ASL {{there is}} a class of indexical (often called 'directional') verbs. These include the signs for 'see', 'pay', 'give', 'show', 'invite', 'help', 'send', 'bite', etc. <b>These</b> <b>verbs</b> include an element of motion that indexes one or more referents, either {{physically}} present or set up through the referent locus system. If there are two loci, the first indicates the subject and the second the object, direct or indirect depending on the verb, reflecting the basic word order of ASL. For example, 'give' is a bi-indexical verb based on a flattened M/O handshape. For 'I give you', the hand moves from myself toward you; for 'you give me', it moves from you to me. 'See' is indicated with a V handshape. Two loci for a dog and a cat can be set up, with the sign moving between them to indicate 'the dog sees the cat' (if it starts at the locus for dog and moves toward the locus for cat) or 'the cat sees the dog' (with the motion in the opposite direction), or the V hand can circulate between both loci and myself to mean 'we (the dog, the cat, and myself) see each other'. The verb 'to be in pain' (index fingers pointed {{at each other and}} alkuately approaching and separating) is signed at the location of the pain (head for headache, cheek for toothache, abdomen for stomachache, etc.). This is normally done in relation to the signer's own body, regardless of the person feeling the pain, but may take also use the locus system, especially for body parts which are not normally part of the sign space, such as the leg. There are also spatial verbs such as put-up and put-below, which allow signers to specify where things are or how they moved them around.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} agent nouns derived from <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> which are apposed to a noun or used independently: ...|$|E
5000|$|Accusative verbs can be {{distinguished}} from unaccusative <b>verbs.</b> <b>These</b> are intransitive <b>verbs</b> which indicate a change of state (usually involuntary) like the following: ...|$|R

25|$|The predicators are in blue. <b>These</b> <b>verb</b> catenae {{generally}} {{contain a}} main verb and potentially {{one or more}} auxiliary verbs. The auxiliary verbs help express functional meaning of aspect and voice. Since the auxiliary verbs contribute functional information only, they do not qualify as separate predicators, but rather each time they form the matrix predicator with the main verb.|$|R
2500|$|Certain verbs in Turkish {{are used}} to enhance the meaning of other verbs, or to agglutinate verbs from nouns. <b>These</b> <b>verbs</b> are called {{auxiliary}} verbs. A concise list follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Because prefixes {{are also}} used to change {{the meaning of a}} verb, {{secondary}} imperfective forms based on perfective verbs with a prefix are needed as well. <b>These</b> <b>verbs</b> are formed regularly: ...|$|E
2500|$|Assimilated verbs have W or Y as {{the first}} root consonant. [...] Most of <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> have been regularized in Egyptian Arabic, e.g. wázan/yíwzin [...] "to weigh" [...] or wíṣíl/yíwṣal [...] "to arrive". [...] Only a couple of {{irregular}} verbs remain, e.g. wíʔif/yúʔaf [...] "stop" [...] and wíʔiʕ/yúʔaʕ [...] "fall" [...] (see below).|$|E
50|$|When {{the element}} is a preposition, {{it is the}} head of a full prepositional phrase and the phrasal verb is thus a prepositional phrasal <b>verb.</b> <b>These</b> phrasal <b>verbs</b> can also be thought of as {{transitive}} and non-separable; the complement follows the phrasal verb.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 The {{distinction}} between <b>these</b> three <b>verbs</b> {{is lost in}} some respectful forms.|$|R

2500|$|Burmese {{does not}} have {{adjectives}} per se. Rather, it has verbs that carry the meaning [...] "to be X", where X is an English adjective. <b>These</b> <b>verbs</b> can modify a noun {{by means of the}} grammatical particle [...] tai. [...] in colloquial Burmese (literary form: [...] sau: , which is suffixed as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the modern}} language, <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> take the regular PNG markers. Only the {{original}} singular relative form without prefix y- {{may still be}} encountered, for example adrar Ø-mqqur-n or adrar i-mqqur-n (mountain which.is.big) [...] "big mountain". Stative verbs {{do not have a}} separate Perfective negative form. The table shows a selection of stative verbs.|$|E
2500|$|Navajo {{does not}} contain a single part of speech {{analogous}} to adjectives; rather, some verbs describe static qualitative attributes (e.g. [...] – he/she/it is large), and demonstrative adjectives (e.g. [...] – this, these) are their own part of speech. However, <b>these</b> <b>verbs,</b> known as [...] "neuter verbs", are distinguished by only having the imperfective mode, as they describe continuous states of being.|$|E
40|$|Study of {{a number}} of abberrant verb forms (écart de la norme) in Canadian French reveals a variety of pressures, {{paradigm}} levelling, markedness reduction and iconcity particular, affecting the inflectional structures. <b>These</b> <b>verb</b> forms, when seen in the light of theorectical proposals of natural morphology, permit a ranking of naturalness priniciples within that approach and contribute to proposals for the resolution of 'naturalness conflicts'...|$|R
50|$|This {{is because}} <b>these</b> <b>verb</b> forms were {{originally}} compounds: cantarei = cantar + hei, cantarás = cantar + hás. In spoken Brazilian Portuguese, where proclisis is nearly universal, mesoclisis never occurs. Although the mesoclisis {{is often cited}} as a distinctive feature of Portuguese, it is becoming rare in spoken European Portuguese, since {{there is a growing}} tendency to replace the future indicative and the conditional with other tenses.|$|R
50|$|As you {{can already}} see from <b>these</b> examples, <b>verbs</b> aren't {{conjugated}} like English verbs, {{but they are}} inflected by tone.|$|R
2500|$|Verbs that {{convey the}} meaning of emotion and {{prolonged}} state belong to this class. The verbs [...] "want" [...] and [...] "can" [...] also belong to this class. Other common examples of Class 4 verbs are [...] "sleep", [...] "miss", [...] "envy" [...] and [...] "believe". <b>These</b> <b>verbs</b> typically mark the subject with the dative and the object with the nominative.|$|E
2500|$|Some verb {{roots are}} {{defective}} {{in the sense}} that they must occur with either or both of the derivational prefixes. [...] For example, from the root {k'mt} (3B) 'sit' there are the forms täx'ämmät'ä 'sit', ax'ämmät'ä 'cause to sit, put' but no form *k'ämmät'ä. [...] Other examples: {ktl} (3B) täxättälä 'follow', {zrb} (3C) täzaräbä 'speak', {ggy} (3C) tägagäyä 'err'. [...] Note that the tä- does not necessarily signify passive or reflexive with <b>these</b> <b>verbs.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the verb}} sneeze is clearly intransitive, it is {{conjugated}} like a transitive verb. In Georgian {{there are a}} few verbs like these, and {{there has not been a}} clear-cut explanation as to why <b>these</b> <b>verbs</b> have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as [...] "sneeze" [...] used to have a direct object (the object being [...] "nose" [...] in the case of [...] "sneeze") and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} the tense-mood relation established in embedded clauses. This research focuses on the possible temporal independence of the subjunctive mood. It shows that the matrix verb is capable of determining the dependence or temporal independence of the subjunctive in the embedded clause. A formal analysis situated {{within the framework of}} the Minimalist Program is proposed for <b>these</b> <b>verb</b> forms. Finally, the relation between this grammatical aspect and negative polarity licensing is shown and explained...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a method to}} {{incorporate}} linguistic information regarding single-word and compound verbs is proposed, {{as a first step}} towards an SMT model based on linguistically-classified phrases. By substituting <b>these</b> <b>verb</b> structures by the base form of the head verb, we achieve a better statistical word alignment performance, and are able to better estimate the translation model and generalize to unseen verb forms during translation. Preliminary experiments for the English- Spanish language pair are performed, and future research lines are detailed. ...|$|R
50|$|Viewing this {{sentence}} as {{consisting of a}} single finite clause, there are five auxiliary verbs and two main verbs present. From {{the point of view}} of predicates, each of the main verbs constitutes the core of a predicate, and the auxiliary verbs contribute functional meaning to <b>these</b> predicates. <b>These</b> <b>verb</b> catenae are periphrastic forms of English, English being a relatively analytic language. Other languages, such as Latin, are synthetic, which means they tend to express functional meaning with affixes, not with auxiliary verbs.|$|R
