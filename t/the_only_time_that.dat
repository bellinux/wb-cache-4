5|$|The twenty days between Braden's {{perfect game}} and Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two perfect games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three perfect games in such short succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's perfect game would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> three consecutive no-hitters had been perfect games, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> three perfect games had occurred in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> three perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a month, the only time four perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game in July 2009), and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> four perfect games had occurred within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E

5|$|A {{long-term}} {{goal of the}} IFAF is for American football {{to be accepted by}} the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the sport was played was at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but as a demonstration sport. Among the various problems the IFAF has to solve in order to be accepted by the IOC are building a competitive women's division, expanding the sport into Africa, and overcoming the current worldwide competitive imbalance that is in favor of American teams.|$|E
5|$|Australia's strongest ever {{performance}} in swimming {{was at the}} 1956 Olympics on home soil in Melbourne. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean sweep of the medals in the 100m freestyle, considered the blue-riband event {{for both men and}} women. This is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals has not been surpassed despite the expansion of the swimming program to its current 32 events.|$|E

5|$|Australia has competed once in ice hockey, in 1960. The {{team lost}} every game, placing last out of nine countries.

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of August 1915, Sing was hospitalised for four days with influenza. That same month, an enemy sniper's bullet struck Sheehan's spotting telescope, injuring his hands and face, and then hit Sing's shoulder, but the latter was back in action after a week's recuperation. Sheehan was more severely wounded, and was shipped back to Australia. This was reportedly <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Sing was injured at Gallipoli. He would not fare so well {{later on in the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff City {{qualified}} for the 1927 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1926–27 FA Cup. They defeated Arsenal by one goal to nil, with the only goal of the game coming from Hughie Ferguson. It was the club's first FA Cup victory, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the trophy had been won by a club outside of England. A few months after Cardiff's victory, the match between them and Corinthians for the FA Charity Shield was set to take place at Stamford Bridge on 12 October. Corinthian announced their team a few days prior to the game, though goalkeeper Benjamin Howard Baker was subsequently replaced by A.M. Russell, who normally played for Cambridge University A.F.C.. Due to an injury to Tom Watson, Billy Hardy was switched to the other wing in defence for Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|Even before {{retiring}} from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931, he {{took part in a}} commission established by Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier. The commission laid the foundations for the Oregon State Police. He began lecturing at events and conferences and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931, he took this up full-time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter's marriage to Marine aviator Lieutenant John Wehle. Her wedding was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he wore his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.|$|E

50|$|In 1902, the Aswan Low Dam was {{completed}} on the Nile River by the British. This threatened many ancient landmarks, including the temple complex of Philae, with being submerged. The {{height of the}} dam was raised twice, from 1907-1912 and from 1929-1934, and the island of Philae was nearly always flooded. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> complex was not underwater was when the dam's sluices were open from July to October.|$|R
50|$|Belgium at the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships is an {{overview}} of the Belgian results at the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> cyclo-cross racers appear in proper national selections of one or multiple sportsmen are the yearly UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. Because of this, all Belgian national cyclo-cross teams (either elite or younger teams) only compete as such during one day per year.

5|$|Hal Nerdal {{competed in}} Nordic combined, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Australia {{has participated in}} the event at the Olympics, and {{finished}} last. Four years after injury prevented them from competing, Bower and Mason recorded Australia's best result, placing 12th in the pairs figure skating, although they were still second to last. Hickey and two male figure skaters—who were close to last—were the only Australians to place in the top 20, while Christine Davy became the first Australian {{to break into the}} top 30 in a skiing event, although she too was in the bottom 20% of the competition. The athletes were accompanied by seven staff members, the largest Australian support contingent until 1988. Chisholm mistakenly noted in his official report that it was Australia's second participation, forgetting the delegations sent in 1936, 1952 and 1956.|$|E
5|$|Harvey’s other Test {{match was}} between Australia and the West Indies at the MCG during the Christmas-New Year period of 197980. It was {{won by the}} {{visitors}} by 10 wickets, with a bowling attack of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft, and Joel Garner proving too powerful for their hosts. Harvey’s colleague was Tony Crafter. Harvey also stood in four ODIs played during the inaugural World Series Cup that season, which involved England, Australia and the West Indies. He presided {{in three of the}} round-robin matches, the third of which was between the two visiting teams at the Gabba. It was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Harvey umpired a match at his adopted home ground. He later presided over the first match of the finals series, between the West Indies and England at the MCG. This was his sixth and final appointment at ODI level. Harvey also officiated three Shield matches, Queensland’s tour match against England and one of their domestic one-dayers during the season.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Pedro Augusto del Valle (1893–1978), as {{a colonel}} was the {{commanding}} officer of the 11th Marine Regiment (artillery). Upon the outbreak of World War II, del Valle led his regiment during the seizure and defense of Guadalcanal, providing artillery support for the 1st Marine Division. In the Battle of the Tenaru, the firepower provided by del Valle's artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers—almost to the last man—before they reached the Marine positions. As {{a result of the}} outcome of the battle Japanese commander, Colonel Ichiki Kiyonao, committed seppuku shortly afterwards. General Alexander Vandegrift, impressed with del Valle's leadership, recommended his promotion and on October 1, 1942, del Valle became a brigadier general. Vandegrift retained del Valle as head of the 11th Marines, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the 11th Marines has ever had a general as their commanding officer. In 1943, he served as Commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Russell and Florida Islands.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Toronto, and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from September 5-December 8, 2006. Hairspray is explicitly set in Baltimore, Maryland and the original 1988 film had been shot on location there, but the 2007 film was shot primarily in Toronto because the city was better equipped with the sound stages necessary to film a musical. The opening shots of the descent from the clouds and the newspaper being dropped onto the stoop are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actual city of Baltimore {{is shown in the}} film.|$|R

(In 1936, James Henry Thomas famously leaked Budget details after the Budget Cabinet, which at the time was being held five days before Budget Day, which had been until that point the traditional period between the Budget Cabinet and Budget Day itself.) Little objection has apparently been raised by the Cabinet to this. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Budget Cabinet has raised objections causing last-minute amendment to the Budget have been: ...|$|R
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{made his}} {{international}} debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He {{took his first}} medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He {{went on to win}} gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku. Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.|$|E

5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964. Australia's Winter Olympic inaugural {{participant}} was long track speed skater Kenneth Kennedy, who competed in 1936 {{and placed in the}} bottom 25% in all of his four events. Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000m long track speed skating, and placed 13th and 14th four years later.

Usually, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> games attracted crowds anywhere near capacity were when the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers came to town and brought thousands of their fans with them. Both teams had large followings in Tampa Bay due to the large number of Midwestern expatriates in the area. [...] As a result, most Bucs home games were blacked out locally; at one point, 32 home games in a row from 1982 to 1986--all or part of five seasons--were not televised locally.|$|R
