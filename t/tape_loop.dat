25|$|Eno {{started the}} Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The {{first group of}} three {{releases}} included his own composition, Discreet Music, and the now-famous The Sinking of the Titanic (1969) and Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet (1971) by Gavin Bryars. The second side of Discreet Music consisted of several versions of Pachelbel's Canon, the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage, to which various algorithmic transformations have been applied, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds {{in some of his}} collaborations with Fripp, most notably on Evening Star. Only ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by John Adams, Michael Nyman, and John Cage. At this time Eno was also affiliating with artists in the Fluxus movement.|$|E
500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Piggies" [...] as {{an attack}} on greed and materialism in modern society. His mother and Lennon helped him {{complete}} the lyrics. Thomas played harpsichord on the track, while Lennon supplied a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> of pigs grunting.|$|E
500|$|... "I've Seen All Good People" [...] is a {{suite of}} two tunes. Anderson wanted the piece to start quietly and develop, leading into a large church organ sound, before moving into the funky second movement. [...] The band had {{difficulty}} recording the initial [...] "Your Move" [...] section, which was resolved by making a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> of bass and drums, over which Howe overdubbed a Portuguese 12-string guitar, miscrediting it as a [...] "vachalia" [...] on the album's credits. Gnidrolog's Colin Goldring played recorder on the track.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> {{in popular}} music {{dates back to}} Jamaican dub music in the 1960s. Dub {{producer}} King Tubby used <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> in his productions, while improvising with homemade delay units. Another dub producer, Sylvan Morris, developed a slapback echo effect by using both mechanical and handmade <b>tape</b> <b>loops.</b> These techniques were later adopted by hip hop musicians in the 1970s [...]|$|R

Another dub producer, Sylvan Morris, developed a slapback echo effect by using both mechanical and handmade <b>tape</b> <b>loops.</b> These techniques were later adopted by hip hop musicians in the 1970s [...] Grandmaster Flash's turntablism is an early example in hip hop.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, use of <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> made a {{breakthrough}} in popular music. As they progressed towards their [...] "psychedelic" [...] phase, The Beatles increasingly experimented with new technologies and magnetic tape recorders, a process which culminated with Revolver (1966) and its last track [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", based on five <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> running simultaneously. [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) was an even more experimental venture, consisting almost entirely of <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> fading in and out [...]|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} mixed and overdubbed at Studio Des Dames, Paris in January 1978. All sources agree that overdubbing {{took place on}} Live and Dangerous, {{although}} there is considerable disagreement {{about the extent of}} them. According to Visconti, the album was [...] "75% recorded in the studio" [...] with only the drums and audience noise remaining from the original live recordings. Visconti later said the overdubs and production were essential in order that the listener could hear a professional sounding band. He claims to have created some audience sounds from a keyboard-triggered <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> in a similar manner to a Mellotron or sampling keyboard. Nevertheless, Visconti was happy with the production and believes the end result sounds authentic.|$|E
500|$|When Phil Spector remixed [...] "For You Blue" [...] for {{inclusion}} on the Let It Be album, on 30 March 1970, {{he added a}} spoken introduction by Lennon: [...] "Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members." [...] This comment was edited in from dialogue recorded at Twickenham Film Studios in early January 1969. Described by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn as a [...] "most interesting" [...] idea, Spector created a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> of the song's instrumental break over which he inserted other items of dialogue from the film, including contrasting reactions {{from members of the}} public to the Beatles' Apple rooftop concert on 30 January 1969. The tape was possibly intended to help promote Let It Be but never released. Despite Johns' extensive contribution, Lennon denied him a producer's credit on the album, which was instead credited to Spector.|$|E
500|$|Martin contributed {{integral}} {{parts to}} other songs, including the piano in [...] "Lovely Rita", the harpsichord in [...] "Fixing a Hole", the old steam organ and <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> arrangement {{that created the}} Pablo Fanque circus atmosphere that Lennon requested on [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] (both Martin and Lennon played steam organ parts for this song), and the orchestration in [...] "Good Night". The first song that Martin did not arrange was [...] "She's Leaving Home", as he had a prior engagement to produce a Cilla Black session, so McCartney contacted arranger Mike Leander to do it. Martin was reportedly hurt by this, but still produced the recording and conducted the orchestra himself. Martin was in demand as an independent arranger and producer {{by the time of}} The White Album, so the Beatles were left to produce various tracks by themselves.|$|E

500|$|My Bloody Valentine {{experimented with}} a noise pop {{sound on the}} album, a venture which was {{influenced}} by The Jesus and Mary Chain, and incorporated elements of twee pop similar to [...] "Strawberry Wine". Shields used a twelve-string electric guitar during the Ecstasys recording sessions and was influenced by The Byrds during the writing process, {{which resulted in the}} guitar tones being [...] "too jingly jangly". Writer Colin Larkin described Ecstasys sound as [...] "bubblegum pop with buzzsaw guitars", which was similar to their prior releases and further diverged from their earlier post-punk and gothic rock sound. Jim DeRogatis noted that Ecstasys overall sound [...] "ushered in a sunnier, more optimistic vibe" [...] for the band which was reminiscent of the sound of 1960s American psychadelia, in particular the Los Angeles based band Love. [...] "Clair", one of the first recordings to feature Bilinda Butcher, features a sampled <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> of audience screams from The Beatles live album, The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl (1977). The sample was processed through audio filters to emulate guitar feedback.|$|E
500|$|On 20 September, the {{recording}} was copied over to 8-track tape in Studio 2, {{to allow for}} overdubbing. Harrison then added his lead vocal, together with harmony vocals on the last verse, creating a mock operatic chorus over the latter section. Through the combination of studio effects and overdubs, his vocal performance on the song consists of three contrasting segments; in Inglis' description, these comprise a [...] "naturalistic" [...] approach {{at the start of}} the track, [...] "a distorted middle" [...] and chorus singing at the end. To produce the sharp nasal sound over the middle eight, Harrison sang through a filter that limited the signal to a narrow, 3.5-kilohertz band. Described by Everett as [...] "remarkable", the pitch of Harrison's vocals in the final verse ranges from a low E bass note in one of the harmony parts, to a descant falsetto B4 in the high harmony part. Lennon created a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> of pre-recorded pig noises, sourced from EMI's library, as well as supplying his own grunting sounds. Drum beats were also added, marking the transition from the solo into the third verse.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{experimental}} songs that Revolver featured was [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's [...] Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied {{the movement of}} a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data. McCartney's [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as [...] "a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song". Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned {{a place on the}} record. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time. During the US tour that followed its release, however, the band performed none of its songs. As Chris Ingham writes, they were very much [...] "studio creations... {{and there was no way}} a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts." [...] The band's final concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.|$|E

2500|$|Many delay {{processors}} {{based on}} analog tape recording, such as Ray Butts' EchoSonic (1952), Mike Battle's Echoplex (1959), or the Roland Space Echo (1973), used magnetic tape as their {{recording and playback}} medium. Electric motors guided a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> through a device {{with a variety of}} mechanisms allowing modification of the effect's parameters. In the case of the popular Echoplex EP-2, the [...] play head was fixed, while a combination record and erase head was mounted on a slide, thus the delay time of the echo was adjusted by changing the distance between the record and play heads. In the Space Echo, all of the heads are fixed, but the speed of the tape could be adjusted, changing the delay time. Thin magnetic tape was not entirely suited for continuous operation, however, so the <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> had to be replaced {{from time to time to}} maintain the audio fidelity of the processed sounds.|$|E

Turnaround 40 seconds, or shorter if necessary. For the 28 tracks of the loop there are 12 pieces recorded with homework, the other 16 pieces are empty and they are intended for the students exercises. (1960-1972) ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{took their}} name from a [...] "Mission of Burma" [...] plaque Conley saw on a New York City {{diplomatic}} building; {{he thought the}} phrase had a [...] "sort of murky and disturbing" [...] quality. Mission of Burma made their debut on April 1, 1979 as a trio, performing at The Modern Theater. Later that month Miller wrote a song, [...] "Nu Disco", that he felt would be improved by a <b>tape</b> <b>loop.</b> Miller then contacted Martin Swope, {{with whom he had}} earlier written some John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen-inspired pieces for piano and tape. Swope was immediately enlisted as the group's live audio engineer and occasional tape-effects artist. His latter role grew gradually, until by 1981 he was adding tape work to most of the group's songs, and was regarded {{as an integral part of}} the group, appearing in group photographs and receiving equal credit on recordings.|$|E

2500|$|Tape echoes became commercially {{available}} in the 1950s. An echo machine is the early name for a sound processing device used with electronic instruments to repeat the sound and produce a simulated echo. The device was popular with guitarists and was used by Brian May, Jimmy Page and Syd Barrett among others. One example is the Echoplex which used a <b>tape</b> <b>loop.</b> [...] The length of delay was adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} tape record and playback heads. [...] Another example is the Roland Space Echo with a record and multiple playback tape heads and a variable tape speed. [...] The time between echo repeats was adjusted by varying the tape speed. [...] The length or intensity of the echo effect was adjusted by changing the amount of echo signal was fed back into the pre-echo signal. [...] Different effects could be created by combining the different playback heads. [...] Some models also included a spring reverb.|$|E
2500|$|At {{one point}} in the 1970s, Wilson {{instructed}} Stephen Desper to create a <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> consisting only of the chorus of [...] "Be My Baby", listening to it for several hours in what Desper saw as [...] "some kind of a trance." [...] Another time, Wilson recalls playing the song's drum intro [...] "ten times until everyone in the room told me to stop, and then I played it ten more times." [...] Mike Love remembers Wilson comparing the song to Einstein's theory of relativity. Music journo David Dalton said that [...] "Brian studied it like an adept memorizing the Koran." [...] In July 1967, he visited Wilson at his home, later writing about a box of tapes he discovered in Wilson's bedroom: [...] "I assumed they were studio demos or reference tracks and threw one on the tape machine. It was the strangest thing ... All the tapes were of Brian talking into a tape recorder. Hour after hour of stoned ramblings on the meaning of life, color vibrations, fate, death, vegetarianism and Phil Spector." ...|$|E
