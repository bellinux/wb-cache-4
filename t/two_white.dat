5|$|A second {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} triggering a TypeIa supernova is {{the merger of}} <b>two</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs whose combined mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. The resulting merger is called a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. In such a case, the total mass would not be constrained by the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E

5|$|There were 147 {{recorded}} lynchings in Oklahoma between 1885 and 1930. Until {{segregation in}} 1907, most victims were white cattle rustlers or highwaymen. In all, 77 victims were white, 50 black, 14 American-Indian, five unknown and one Chinese. Five women—two black, <b>two</b> <b>white</b> and one other—were lynched in Oklahoma in four incidents between 1851 and 1946.|$|E

5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the <b>two</b> <b>white</b> main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of <b>two</b> <b>white</b> dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion, {{a variety of}} {{phenomena}} may occur, including novae and Type Ia supernovae. It {{may also be a}} super-soft x-ray source if it is able to take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface. A close binary system of <b>two</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs can radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves, causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge.|$|E

5|$|In early 1860, Ross {{enlisted in}} Captain J. M. Smith's Waco company of Texas Rangers, which formed {{to fight the}} renegade Native Americans. Smith {{appointed}} Ross his second lieutenant. When Smith was promoted, the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain. In conjunction with several other Ranger companies, Ross led his men to retaliate against a Kickapoo tribe which had murdered <b>two</b> <b>white</b> families. The tribe had been warned of the Rangers' approach and set the prairie ablaze. The Rangers were forced to abandon their mission when confronted with the massive wildfire.|$|E
5|$|The Castello de Zanna {{is a small}} fortress, {{situated}} in the frazione of Majon. It consists of low white outer walls and <b>two</b> <b>white</b> corner towers, with a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The construction of the castle began in 1694, but on August 19, 1696 the works were interrupted; the building remained unfinished in 1809 when it was burned by French revolutionary troops who had invaded Ampezzo. Since then the castle has undergone restoration.|$|E
5|$|The mutineers {{broke into}} the base's armoury {{on the morning of}} 20 February and pillaged the white quarter of the town. The town's {{inhabitants}} fled, and a Belgian officer and <b>two</b> <b>white</b> civilians were killed. The mutineers attacked visible signs of the colonial authorities and proclaimed their desire for independence. The mutineers then dispersed to their home villages, pillaging on the way; they failed to spread the insurrection to neighbouring garrisons. Two mutineers, including Mukalabushi, were executed for their part in the insurrection.|$|E

5|$|The nests, built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud {{plastered}} to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a concave cup. The female typically lays <b>two</b> <b>white</b> eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E
5|$|The pilgrimage occurs {{from the}} 8th to 12th (or {{in some cases}} 13th) of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic {{calendar}}. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear <b>two</b> <b>white</b> sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of <b>two</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
5|$|After ZANLA spent 1971 and 1972 covertly subverting {{the local}} black {{population}} of north-eastern Rhodesia to their {{side in the}} Maoist fashion, it attacked <b>two</b> <b>white</b> farms near the north-eastern village of Centenary in December 1972. The RLI {{was one of the}} first units despatched to counter the infiltration, and Operation Hurricane, a major counter-insurgency action, was started in the country's north-east soon after. Hurricane would last for the rest of the war, eventually just one of seven operational areas defined across Rhodesia by the security forces—Operations Thrasher, Repulse and Tangent followed in 1976, Grapple began a year later and Splinter, covering Lake Kariba, started in 1978. SALOPS ("Salisbury Operations") covered the Rhodesian capital.|$|E
5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur {{only once every}} -; far less {{frequently}} than the appearance of novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely scenario is a collision with a binary star system, or between two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision can leave behind a close binary system of <b>two</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through their shared envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected in our neighborhood.|$|E
