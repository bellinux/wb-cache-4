A new {{feature of this}} model is predicting each plasma parameter for a specified probability (percentile). The new model was produced as follows. We start from a reference model for each plasma parameter, which was scaled to fit the data of Galileo plasma spectrometer. The scaled model was then represented {{as a function of}} radial distance, magnetic local time, and magnetic latitude, presumably describing the mean states. Then, the deviation of the observed values from the model were attribute to the variability in the environment, which was accounted for by the percentile at a given location.

The ATS package was implemented on the two platforms WINDOWS NT and Macintosh. Due to timely constraints, the implementation was done on each platform independently. The source code of the API described herein copmiles on WINDOWS NT and should be easily ported to the Macintosh platform. Most of the sources have been compiled on a Macintosh already, but as a part of the ATS package the sources described within this document <b>are</b> not <b>inteded</b> to <b>be</b> compiled on a Macintosh. However, the API itself is supposed to be platform-independent. For a description of the basic concepts, see the manual Concepts.

The description in the reference manual allows to unerstand the usage of each indi vidual function of the modules. But, nevertheless, the basic concepts on how these funcitons are used in combination need to be described separately, which is done here. The only modules, which are used by (nearly) every module are the rror module (ERR), the debug module (DBG) and the option module (OPT). These modules are associated with the tasks Error handling, Debugging and Option parsing. These tasks have several implications on all of the other modules.
