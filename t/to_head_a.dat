5|$|As {{evident in}} his {{imperial}} edicts, the Hongwu Emperor {{was well aware of}} the Buddhist link between Tibet and China and wanted to foster it.

5|$|Following {{continued}} turmoil {{between the}} centre-right parties, {{there was even}} an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> centre-right national unity government on a balanced budget program, an idea he did not reject.

5|$|John Sigismund, {{originally}} Roman Catholic, {{converted to}} Lutheranism {{before the end}} of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian did not share either the Lutheran or the Calvinist view) <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> synod to reconcile the Lutheran and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564.

5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), {{in response to}} voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in name only, and did {{not support}} the saquarema ideology and leadership. During the years following 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Iranian {{students}} {{seized the}} American embassy in Tehran {{and held the}} embassy staff hostage; the first rescue operation, code-named Eagle Claw ended in failure due to equipment and coordination problems, culminating in the crash of a RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter into a parked C-130 Hercules in the Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen. A second rescue attempt, Operation Credible Sport, was ordered, and Brown was involved in planning and preparation. The follow-up rescue included U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and Army assets. The Army units involved were the battalions {{that made up the}} 101st Aviation Group: the 158th Aviation Battalion, the 229th Aviation Battalion and the 159th Aviation Battalion. All three battalions formed Task Force 158. President Carter meanwhile appointed the former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral James L. Holloway, III, <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> commission to study the deficiencies revealed by the failure of Eagle Claw. Among the presented findings {{was the fact that the}} military lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform these mission types.|$|E

The other ship cut her anchor and attempted to flee, but the boats of Clarisse overhauled and captured her without resistance, most of her crew being ashore. Surcouf returned to Île de France with his prizes in June.|$|E
5|$|McNulty harbors {{a grudge}} against his former commanders for reassigning {{him to the}} marine unit. When {{thirteen}} unidentified young women are found dead in a container at the docks, McNulty successfully makes a spiteful effort to place the murders within the jurisdiction of his former commander. Meanwhile, police Major Stan Valchek gets into a feud with Polish-American Frank Sobotka, {{a leader of the}} International Brotherhood of Stevedores, a fictional dockers' union, over competing donations to their old neighborhood church. Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka. Cedric Daniels is interviewed, having been praised by Prez, Major Valchek's son-in-law, and also because of his work on the Barksdale case. He is eventually selected to lead the detail assigned just to investigate Sobotka; when the investigation is concluded Daniels is assured he will move up <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> special case unit with personnel of his choosing.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June the Regent {{appointed}} Lord Liverpool <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> new Tory administration. Despite their eulogies {{to their}} fallen leader, {{members of the}} new government soon began to distance themselves from his ministry. Many of the changes that Perceval had opposed were gradually introduced: greater press freedom, Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. The Orders in Council were repealed on 23 June, but too late to avoid the declaration of war on Britain by the United States. Lord Liverpool's government did not maintain Perceval's resolution in acting against the illegal slave trade, which began to flourish as the authorities looked the other way. Linklater estimates that around 40,000 slaves were illegally transported from Africa to the West Indies, because of lax enforcement of the law.|$|E

The members of the party's pre-poll alliance committee were M. Veerappa Moily, A. K. Antony, Jitender Singh, and Suresh Pachauri.
