The CZCS used a rotating plane mirror at a 45 degree angle to the optic axis of a Cassegrain telescope. The mirror scanned 360 degrees but only the 80 degrees of data centered on nadir were collected for ocean color measurements. The instrument viewed deep space and calibration sources during {{the remainder of the}} scan. The incoming radiation was collected by the telescope and divided into two streams by a dichroic beam splitter. One stream was transmitted to a field stop that was also the entrance aperture of a small polychromator. The radiance that entered the polychromator was separated and re-imaged in five wavelengths on five silicon detectors in the focal plane of the polychromator. The other stream was directed to a cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector in the <b>thermal</b> <b>region</b> (10.5-12.5 micrometer). A radiative cooler was used to cool the thermal detector. To avoid sun glint, the scanner mirror was tilted about the sensor pitch axis on command so that the line of sight of the sensor was moved in 2-degree increments up to 20 degrees with respect to the nadir. Spectral bands at 0.443 and 0.670 micrometers centered on the most intense absorption bands of chlorophyll, while the band at 0.550 micrometers centered on the [...] "hinge point," [...] the wavelength of minimum absorption. Ratios of measured energies in these channels were shown to closely parallel surface chlorophyll concentrations. Data from the scanning radiometer were processed, with algorithms developed from the field experiment data, to produce maps of chlorophyll absorption. The temperatures of coastal waters and ocean currents were measured in a spectral band centered at 11.5 micrometers. Observations were made also in two other spectral bands, 0.520 micrometers for chlorophyll correlation and 0.750 micrometers for surface vegetation. The scan width was 1556 km centered on nadir and the ground resolution was 0.825 km at nadir.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{additional}} evidence {{was derived from}} the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper observations that allows a more complete model for the formation of Low <b>Thermal</b> inertia-high Albedo <b>regions</b> to be proposed. The first observation is that dust appears to be currently accumulating in the low <b>thermal</b> inertia <b>regions.</b> Following each global dust storm a thin layer of dust is deposited globally, as evidenced by an increase in surface albedo seen from orbit and from the Viking Lander sites. During the period following the storm, the bright dust fallout is subsequently removed from low albedo regions, as indicated by the post-storm darkening of these surfaces and by an increase in the atmospheric dust content over dark regions relative to the bright, low <b>thermal</b> inertia <b>regions.</b> Thus, the fine dust storm material is removed from dark regions but not from the bright regions, resulting in a net accumulation within the bright, low <b>thermal</b> inertia <b>regions.</b> Once deposition has begun, the covering of exposed rocks and sand and the accumulation of fine material on the surface make removal of material increasingly difficult, thereby enhancing the likelihood that material will accumulate within the low <b>thermal</b> inertia <b>regions...</b>|$|R

On a line crossing the Paeroa Scarp near its highest point, where the throw is 425 m, the topographic effect is inferred to cause the apparent resistivities to be lowered by about 40 %, which accounts for the measured resistivity anomaly at the fault scarp. At the north-west of the Waikite-Puakohurea <b>thermal</b> <b>region</b> on another line, the topographic effect of a 100 m high ridge on Mt Waikorapa causes the apparent resistivities to be reduced by about 15 %.

40|$|AbstractThe Network-on-Chip (NoC) is an {{important}} technology that replaced the traditional bus-based architecture {{for the future of}} System-on-Chip (SoC). The NoC system provides better scalability, performance, reliability, etc. to the SoC networks by implementing the principles of interconnection networks and packet switching. One of the major problems in NoC is the increase in temperature of the nodes that leads to unbalanced thermal management within the network. This further leads to performance degradation due to damaged nodes. A novel thermal management scheme is proposed in this paper, which makes use of the thermal state and buffer state of the nodes for routing the packets. The proposed Prioritized Thermo-Buffer based Adaptive Routing (PT-BAR) protocol maintains a <b>thermal</b> <b>region</b> based on the thermal balance of the nodes within the region. Only high priority packets are transferred through the <b>thermal</b> <b>region</b> to preserve thermal balance throughout the network. During packet transfers the thermo-buffer model considers the energy consumption and thermal conductivity of nodes to calculate temperature and the current buffer state of the node. This factor is used to choose a path that will provide better performance in end-to-end delay and throughput while preserving the thermal balance of the network. Proposed PT-BAR reduces the temperature by 1. 5 ° C than the existing protocol by making use of the efficient thermal model and buffer models for the efficient routing strategy...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} numerical investigations of breakdown waves concentrating on antiforce waves. We employed one-dimensional electron fluid dynamical equations for a luminous pulse wave propagating into a neutral gas region {{and subjected to}} an applied electric field. We assumed that the electrons were the main element in the propagation of the wave and that the electron gas partial pressure provided the driving force. These waves {{are considered to be}} shock fronted and are composed of two regions: the thin sheath region behind the shock front and the thicker quasi-neutral region following the sheath region. Our set of equations, known as the electron fluid dynamical (EFD) equations, is composed of the equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy coupled with Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s equation. For antiforce waves, we were able to successfully integrate the set of EFD equations through the sheath region using a set of initial boundary conditions at the wave front. By using values of electron gas temperature, electron number density, ionization rate, and also the existing conditions {{at the end of the}} sheath region as initial boundary values for the <b>thermal</b> <b>region</b> of the gas, we were able to integrate the electron fluid dynamical equations, modified for the <b>thermal</b> <b>region</b> of the gas, through that region.
