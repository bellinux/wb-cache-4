5|$|Across the way, Mr. Speaker, sit the {{purveyors of}} gloom who would {{endeavour}} for political purposes, <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> the Canadian people... They had a warning... Did {{they tell us}} that? No. Mr. Speaker, why did they not reveal this? Why did they not act when the House was sitting in January, February, March, and April? They had the information... You concealed the facts, {{that is what you}} did.|$|E
5|$|The US 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division was {{ineffective}} {{in its first}} showing. The regiment, composed mostly of black troops, was criticized by the Army for being quick <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and retreat. Some historians have described the Army's statements as biased, downplaying the regiment's successes and overstating its failures.|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> {{continued in}} nearly all the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju. Men left their positions and straggled to the rear. They abandoned weapons on positions. On many occasions units lost most of their equipment while on the move, even when not under fire, causing logistical shortages. In other cases the majority of a unit would desert its position {{at the first sign}} of North Korean fire.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{religious}} alarms of renewed Gunpowder Plots. Suspicions rose <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and collective paranoia on Monday, {{and both the}} Trained Bands and the Coldstream Guards focused less on fire fighting and more on rounding up foreigners, Catholics, and any odd-looking people, arresting them or rescuing them from mobs, or both together.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Masan in August 1950, Thompson {{was part}} of a unit {{conducting}} an offensive along the Pusan Perimeter. When North Korean troops attacked his company and caused many men <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and scatter, Thompson stood his ground, refusing orders to evacuate despite being wounded, and covering the retreat of his platoon until he was killed by a grenade. For his actions, Thompson was awarded the Medal of Honor, one of only two African Americans to be so honored in the war.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1950, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the 25th Infantry Division {{was engaged}} in a counteroffensive near Masan, during the Battle of Masan. That night, M Company was {{supporting}} the division's advance {{near the city of}} Haman, South Korea, in a mountain valley south of Sobuk-san. As Thompson's platoon approached the town, it was ambushed by a large force of North Korean People's Army troops. Automatic weapons fire caused several men in the company <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and flee. Those remaining were ordered into a tight perimeter by Second Lieutenant Herbert H. Wilson.|$|E
5000|$|The Unions, {{along with}} the Cuban Giants, are the only Negro teams to survive the {{political}} and economic crisis that eventually lead <b>to</b> the <b>Panic</b> of 1893.

25|$|Securities {{trade in}} the latter {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries was prone <b>to</b> <b>panics</b> and crashes. Government {{regulation}} of securities trading was eventually seen as necessary, with arguably the most dramatic changes occurring in the 1930s after a major stock market crash precipitated an economic depression.|$|R

5|$|Texians began {{crossing}} {{the river at}} about 7pm. Less {{than half of the}} men were mounted, slowing their progress as they tracked the Mexican soldiers. A thick fog rolled in around midnight, further delaying them. At around 3 am, Texians reached the new Mexican camp. A dog barked at their approach, alerting the Mexican soldiers, who began to fire. The noise caused one of the Texian horses <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and throw his rider, who suffered a bloody nose. Moore and his men hid in the thick trees until dawn. As they waited, some of the Texians raided a nearby field and snacked on watermelon.|$|E
5|$|Union troops retreated in {{different}} states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge {{were said to}} move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone. When Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk, not wishing <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, three abreast. A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves {{to the pursuit of}} the Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Alexander the Great trained {{his foot}} {{soldiers}} to injure {{the animals and}} cause them <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, {{who was one of}} Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.|$|E

5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match. Johnny Devine interfered midway through by hitting Storm with a kendo stick, {{which led to a}} pinfall attempt by Young, however Stormed kicked out at two. Later, Young went to grab a chair from Devine who had his back turned to the ring. This caused Devine <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and hit Young in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning his shoulders to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E
5|$|Ernouf {{was on an}} {{inspection}} away from this command when Napoleon landed at Cannes. Upon his landing, many of the soldiers of Angoulême's army flocked to Bonaparte's banner, beginning the Hundred Days. The mere news of Napoleon's escape from Elba and the defection {{of some of the}} troops caused Charles, Duke of Angoulême, <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and capitulate. Ernouf returned to Marseille, where he learned that André Masséna also had chosen the imperial cause, after which he left for Paris. Napoleon rescinded Ernouf's honors and titles, and dismissed him from his post in the military on 15April 1815. After Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the second restoration of the Bourbons that summer also restored Ernouf's rights and property.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead if he were <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> or lose his poise {{during the course of}} a game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Marge {{has begun}} <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> over {{being unable to}} {{communicate}} with Homer, as she knows nothing of his undercover work and cannot get any information on his whereabouts. She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories. Fit Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as Fit Fat Tony and then simply Fat Tony - now physically indistinguishable from the original.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town <b>to</b> <b>panic,</b> and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Kranji was {{the second}} stage of the Empire of Japan's plan for the {{invasion}} of Singapore during the Second World War. On 9 February 1942 the Imperial Japanese Army assaulted the north-western front of the British colony of Singapore. Their primary objective was to secure a second beachhead after their successful assault at Sarimbun Beach on 8 February, in order to breach the Jurong-Kranji defence line as part of their southward thrust towards the heart of Singapore City. Defending the shoreline between the Kranji River and the Johor–Singapore Causeway was the Australian 27th Brigade, led by Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, and one irregular company. On 10 February the Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses while moving up the Kranji River, which caused them <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> and nearly aborted the operation. However, a series of miscommunications and withdrawals by Allied forces in the ensuing battles allowed the Japanese to swiftly gain strategic footholds, which eventually led to the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Nozomi Group in Shibuya is {{revealed}} to be using their Noah II machine to synthetically use gigalomaniac power for their own gain; to do this, they have people carrying transmitters to increase Noah II's signal reach. When a Noah II-created delusion causes people <b>to</b> <b>panic,</b> Sena and Kozue destroy nearby transmitters, and Takumi, Sena and Kozue join forces to stop Nozomi. They infiltrate Nozomi's headquarters and reach an underground research facility where they find Noah II and Genichi Norose, the president of Nozomi, who tries to stop them; they defeat him and destroy the machine, but it {{is revealed}} that the machine was just a prototype and not the actual Noah II, and that the Norose they fought was a real-booted delusion projected by the machine.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{there was}} chaotic. Large numbers of {{vehicles}} loaded with soldiers were {{moving down the}} road to the rear. Many soldiers on foot were on the road. Champney tried repeatedly but in vain to get these men to stop and turn around. The few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans <b>to</b> <b>panic</b> further and increase their speed to the rear. The road was so clogged with retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack. In the six hours he waited at this point, Check observed that none of the retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 24th Infantry, could be assembled as units. Military police tried in vain to reassemble troops, but they refused even at gunpoint. At 16:00, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, assembling {{in the rear of the}} 27th Infantry, could muster only 150 to 200 men.|$|E

40|$|Human {{collective}} {{behavior can}} vary from calm <b>to</b> <b>panicked</b> depending on social context. Using videos publicly available online, we study the highly energized collective motion of attendees at heavy metal concerts. We find these extreme social gatherings generate similarly extreme behaviors: a disordered gas-like state called a mosh pit and an ordered vortex-like state called a circle pit. Both phenomena are reproduced in flocking simulations demonstrating that human collective behavior {{is consistent with the}} predictions of simplified models. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{instability}} {{can have}} large {{adverse effects on}} an economy. One major cause of instability is asset price bubbles.

Banking crises can arise due <b>to</b> <b>panics</b> or {{as a result of the}} business cycle. Contagion and financial fragility can cause small disturbances to have large effects. Finally, policy issues are touched upon...|$|R
