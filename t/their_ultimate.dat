5|$|The Admiral Spiridov {{class were}} {{a pair of}} {{monitors}} built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s. The sister ships {{were assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for their entire careers. Aside from several accidental collisions and one grounding, their careers were uneventful. They were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900. The Admiral Spiridovs were stricken from the Navy List in 1907; one ship became a stationary target and the other a coal-storage barge. <b>Their</b> <b>ultimate</b> fates are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ended up}} being used primarily to develop arresting gear and barriers, but were used operationally {{for a short time}} by at least one Texas-based United States Naval Reserve squadron as they transitioned to jets. Between them, the 30 production aircraft had only a total of 945 hours of flight time, only 31.5 hours each. Some aircraft flew only six hours which was enough for little more than their acceptance flight and the flight to <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> disposition.|$|E

5|$|Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; {{the royal}} hypogeum {{provided}} {{a large amount}} of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices associated with it. Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.|$|E
5|$|From the Han dynasty to {{the early}} Tang dynasty, Hong Kong {{was a part of}} Bao'an County. In the Tang dynasty, modern-day Guangzhou (Canton) flourished as an {{international}} trading centre. In 736, the Emperor Xuanzong of Tang established a military stronghold in Tuen Mun to strengthen defence of the coastal area. The nearby Lantau Island was a salt production centre and salt smuggler riots occasionally broke out against the government. In c. 1075, The first village school, Li Ying College, was established around 1075 AD in modern-day New Territories by the Northern Song dynasty. During their war against the Mongols, the imperial court of Southern Song was briefly stationed at modern-day Kowloon City (the Sung Wong Toi site) before <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> defeat by the Mongols at the Battle of Yamen in 1279. The Mongols then established their dynastic court and governed Hong Kong for 97 years.|$|E

MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> control. Unlike Germany, {{there was a certain}} partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and the {{most of the rest of}} the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than it otherwise would have been.|$|E
5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. <b>Their</b> <b>ultimate</b> international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{develops}} in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages. It changes in shape {{from a simple}} swelling {{at the front of}} the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the tissue to reach <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of Spira includes distinct ethnic minorities including a {{portrayal of the}} fictional Al Bhed language that is prevalent throughout the game's dialogue. The backstory and concept behind the dark religious themes of Final Fantasy X were a central theme to the story and <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> resolution was well received. The popularity of the Eternal Calm video served as the impetus of Square Enix to do Final Fantasy X-2 to make their first direct sequel in video game form and depict the evolution of Spiran society after religious and political upheaval results in new factions and instability in the world. Spira and its inhabiting characters have been featured in several other Square Enix works including Dissidia Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and three games within the Kingdom Hearts series and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{varieties}} of short-period comet: Jupiter-family comets (those with semi-major axes of less than 5AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, Halley's Comet, are unusual in that although they are short-period comets, it is hypothesized that <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is suggested they were long-period comets that were captured by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System. This process may have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Germany, the {{question}} became {{what to do with}} the ships of the High Seas Fleet. Because no neutral nation wanted to host the rebellious sailors of the mutinous armada, the Allies eventually decided to have the force interned at Scapa Flow, with the guns of the Grand Fleet's ships nearby in case of any attempt at a break-out. On 15 November, Beatty met with Hipper's representative, Rear Admiral Hugo Meurer, to arrange the surrender of the German ships. Meurer agreed to surrender to Beatty in the Firth of Forth. From there, the German vessels would proceed to Scapa Flow, until <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> fate was decided by the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E

5|$|In {{the hope}} of gaining access to the {{state-of-the-art}} resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture {{on the work of}} Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute's William Bollay— a PhD student specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another PhD student named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate {{under the auspices of the}} university's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. <b>Their</b> <b>ultimate</b> fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E
5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed {{a large portion of}} the armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By the end of the month, {{a large portion of the}} Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on <b>their</b> <b>ultimate</b> objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for this front. Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E
