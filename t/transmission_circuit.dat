50|$|In a data <b>transmission</b> <b>circuit</b> a {{backward}} channel is the channel that passes {{data in a}} direction opposite to that of its associated forward channel. The backward channel is usually used for transmission of request, supervisory, acknowledgement, or error-control signals. The direction of flow of these signals is opposite to that in which user information is being transferred. The backward-channel bandwidth is usually {{less than that of}} the primary channel, that is, the forward (user information) channel.

40|$|The N 3 {{power plant}} of Taipower {{is located in}} the {{southern}} tip of Taiwan and connected to the power pool by four out-linking 345 -kV overhead <b>transmission</b> <b>circuits.</b> There are two 951 -MW generators. Each generator occupied 11 % of the system peak load in 1985 when the generator was in commercial operation. Since Taipower is an isolated system, at the N- 2 conditions, those generators were reduced to 75 % loading to protect the power system. By the way, to avoid damage of negative sequence current (NSC), the limits of the N 3 power plant are stricter than those in the IEEE Standard. However, in 2010, the capacity ratio of each generator in the plant to the system peak load has been reduced to 3 % only. To increase the economic benefit of those generators, it is required to reassess the operation limits of NSC. EMTP was used to calculate the levels of NSC from the out-linking <b>transmission</b> <b>circuits.</b> From the results of this study, the effects of NSC could be ignored when the four out-linking circuits are in N- 0, N- 1, and N- 2 conditions. The generators can be operated in full loading under these conditions. The modifications to the NSC limits of the N 3 power plant are also suggested...|$|R

The use of overhead line transmission can not only increase the voltage level and system capacity, but also efficiently reduce the circuit investment and save the construction costs.

50|$|In any {{alternating}} current transmission line, the inductance and capacitance of the conductors can be significant. Currents that flow solely in ‘reaction’ to these {{properties of the}} circuit, (which together with the resistance define the impedance) constitute reactive power flow, which transmits no ‘real’ power to the load. These reactive currents, however, are very real and cause extra heating losses in the <b>transmission</b> <b>circuit.</b> The ratio of 'real' power (transmitted to the load) to 'apparent' power (the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle) is the power factor. As reactive current increases, the reactive power increases and the power factor decreases. For transmission systems with low power factor, losses are higher than for systems with high power factor. Utilities add capacitor banks, reactors and other components (such as phase-shifting transformers; static VAR compensators; and flexible AC transmission systems, FACTS) throughout the system help {{to compensate for the}} reactive power flow, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the area}} affected, about 200,000 people {{continued}} to have power - in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario; the easternmost corner of Ontario (centered on Cornwall); the Buffalo, NY area, excluding southern Erie county, along the shore of Lake Huron via a feeder line to Owen Sound from Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. Three of the four Bruce B units were able to throttle back their output without a complete shutdown, then reconnect to the grid within five hours; the portion of New York state including parts of Albany and north and west of Albany; a small pocket of mid-east Michigan; the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; and small pockets in New Jersey. The unaffected area was protected by <b>transmission</b> <b>circuit</b> devices at the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations in Niagara Falls, (coincidentally, {{the starting point of}} the Northeast blackout of 1965) at a switching station of the hydroelectric power station in Cornwall, as well as central New York state. Philadelphia and the surrounding mid-Atlantic areas were also completely unaffected because PJM disconnected them. The power plant in East China, Michigan remained online for about 36 hours, and residents were informed that the plant would have to shut down in order to facilitate the reboot of the whole system.|$|E
50|$|Prior to World War II, St. Stephen’s {{local economy}} was heavily {{based in the}} lumber and ship {{building}} industry. At {{the end of the}} 18th century, there were no less than one hundred various dry docks and slips along the river (both shared by the cities of Calais and St. Stephen). Many of the larger families in the area (such as the Merchies, and the Todds) ran much of the town’s economy due to the monopoly they had on the St. Croix River system. Many various lumbering companies were stationed along the river, both from the Canadian and American side, and they distinguished each company’s lumber from another’s by branding each log with a specific symbol, unique to each lumbering company. Both the lumbering and shipping industry employed thousands of individuals, and by the early 1900s, 200 ships had been built in the St. Croix waters.However, by the end of World War II the town's main employers were the Ganong Bros. Limited chocolate company (established 1873, Canada's oldest candy company), and—with 20,000 spindles—Canada's second largest textile mill, which opened its doors in June 1882 on the river where it operated with its own hydro-electric generating station, the Milltown Dam. Electricity generated by the Milltown Dam is exported to the United States, connected to a 69kV <b>transmission</b> <b>circuit</b> owned by the Eastern Maine Electric Cooperative, an electric utility serving Calais. In 1957, the textile mill closed, and it was demolished in 1972. At one time, the St. Croix Cotton Mill employed as many as 1200 persons at peak periods. The confectionery maker remains a key employer.|$|E
