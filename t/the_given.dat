5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing <b>the</b> <b>given</b> circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify the configuration of <b>the</b> <b>given</b> circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of <b>the</b> <b>given</b> circles.|$|E

5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are <b>the</b> <b>given</b> circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles.

The two conjugate solution circles are related by inversion, by the following argument.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of <b>the</b> <b>given</b> elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of <b>the</b> <b>given</b> circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
