5|$|Supersonic {{short-range}} nuclear missiles: G and H {{models were}} modified <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 20 SRAM missiles replacing existing gravity bombs. Eight SRAMs were carried internally {{on a special}} rotary launcher and 12 SRAMs were mounted on two wing pylons. With SRAM, the B-52s could strike heavily defended targets without entering the terminal defenses.|$|E
5|$|The FB-22 was a {{proposed}} medium-range bomber for the USAF. The FB-22 was projected <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to {{about twice the}} range of the F-22A, while maintaining the F-22's stealth and supersonic speed. However, the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic bomber with a much greater range.|$|E

5|$|The Tornado GR1B was a {{specialised}} anti-shipping {{variant of}} the GR1. A total of 26 were converted, which were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. Each aircraft was equipped <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile's seeker for target acquisition, later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased {{the island}} for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate {{starting}} on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project. The project team operates the Lewis Alexander, a boat which was purpose-built for the crossing to Flat Holm and which is able <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 45 passengers and essential supplies to the island. The work of the Flat Holm Project {{is supported by the}} registered charity the Flat Holm Society.|$|E
5|$|Over the Type UBIs' {{first year}} of service, UB-4 and UB-13 were both lost, and UB-2 and UB-5 were {{transferred}} to the Baltic Flotilla. In March 1917, UB-6 ran aground in Dutch waters and was interned {{for the rest of}} the war, along with her crew. The four remaining Type UBIs in Flanders—UB-10, UB-12, UB-16, UB-17—were all converted to minelayers by 1918, having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to eight mines. All but UB-10 were lost in 1918; UB-10, in poor repair and out of service, was scuttled in October 1918 when the Germans evacuated from Flanders.|$|E

5|$|The summit {{observatory}} {{was built}} in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first path to the summit was built {{at the same time as}} the observatory and was designed to allow ponies <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five. The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a rack railway to the summit, none of which came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Those B-52Gs not {{converted}} as {{cruise missile}} carriers underwent {{a series of}} modifications to improve conventional bombing. They were fitted with a new Integrated Conventional Stores Management System (ICSMS) and new underwing pylons that could hold larger bombs or other stores than could the external pylons. Thirty B-52Gs were further modified <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 12 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles each, while 12 B-52Gs were fitted to carry the AGM-142 Have Nap stand-off air-to-ground missile. When the B-52G was retired in 1994, an urgent scheme was launched to restore an interim Harpoon and Have Nap capability, the four aircraft being modified to carry Harpoon and four to carry Have Nap under the Rapid Eight program.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

It was originally designed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> rail vehicles <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 18 LT in weight, and was converted for road vehicles in 1940. In 1953 it was further modified <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> loads of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30 LT.|$|R

5|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 20 AGM-69 SRAM nuclear {{missiles}} {{was added to}} G and H models, starting in 1971. To further improve its offensive ability, air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) were fitted. After testing of both the Air Force-backed Boeing AGM-86 and the Navy-backed General Dynamics AGM-109 Tomahawk, the AGM-86B was selected for operation by the B-52 (and ultimately by the B-1 Lancer). A total of 194 B-52Gs and Hs were modified to carry AGM-86s, carrying 12 missiles on underwing pylons, with 82 B-52Hs further modified to carry another eight missiles on a rotary launcher fitted in the bomb-bay. To conform with SALT II Treaty requirements that cruise missile-capable aircraft be readily identifiable by reconnaissance satellites, the cruise missile armed B-52Gs were modified with a distinctive wing root fairing. As all B-52Hs were assumed modified, no visual modification of these aircraft was required. In 1990, the stealthy AGM-129 ACM cruise missile entered service; although intended to replace the AGM-86, a high cost and the Cold War's end led to only 450 being produced; unlike the AGM-86, no conventional (non-nuclear) version was built. The B-52 {{was to have been}} modified to utilize Northrop Grumman's AGM-137 TSSAM weapon; however, the missile was canceled due to development costs.|$|E
