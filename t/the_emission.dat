5|$|Alpha decay: {{this process}} is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus {{consisting}} of two protons and two neutrons. The result of <b>the</b> <b>emission</b> is a new element with a lower atomic number.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>emission</b> of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes <b>the</b> <b>emission</b> of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid.

5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of <b>the</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E
