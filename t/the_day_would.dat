As August 14 dawned, Suzuki, Kido, and the Emperor realized <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> end with either an acceptance of the American terms or a military coup.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, {{according to the}} rules of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>would</b> have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is thought that he did not mention them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E

5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That {{day was a}} {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. <b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> be the first official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E
5|$|Liverpool manager Joe Fagan bought Walsh for a £700,000 fee in May 1984. Walsh {{turned down}} an {{approach}} from Italian Serie A side Calcio Como to join Liverpool. He joined Liverpool in time to travel with the players to Rome to see them win the 1984 European Cup Final. He made his debut as a substitute on 18 August 1984 in the 1–0 Charity Shield defeat to derby rivals Everton. With Ian Rush injured {{at the start of}} the 1984–85 season, Walsh partnered Kenny Dalglish up front, and he scored just 14 minutes into his Anfield debut on 27 August in a 3–0 win over West Ham United. However, he picked up a knee injury in October which caused him to miss six weeks and allowed Rush to re-establish himself as Dalglish's preferred strike partner. He scored 13 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions throughout the 1984–85 campaign, the most significant goal being the equaliser in the last minute of extra-time against rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals at Goodison Park. However Liverpool would lose the replay, and also finished as runners-up in the league and European Cup. Walsh started the 1985 European Cup Final against Juventus at Heysell Stadium, but had to come off early in the second half after aggravating a stomach injury; Liverpool lost the game 1–0, though <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> be remembered for the disaster which cost 39 lives.|$|E

25|$|The bank's {{emergence}} as a forward-looking institution was highlighted by the announcement in 1962 {{that it would have}} a new and very high-profile head office in downtown Toronto.

25|$|Critics of {{polygamy}} in {{the early}} LDS Church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives {{that would otherwise be}} considered immoral.

Cannon (an apostle at the time) claimed tha fellow apostle Lorenzo Snow stated that <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> come when brothers and sisters could get married in the Church, and that Brigham Young purportedly shared these views.|$|E

25|$|Wednesday 16 February— Ash Wednesday on the Christian calendar—dawned {{as another}} unrelentingly hot, dry day. The weather early on Ash Wednesday was complex {{and did not}} signify how <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> develop. A front {{separated}} hot, dry air {{coming in from the}} interior to the north, from cooler air moving eastwards from the Southern Ocean. Ahead of the front were hot, turbulent, gale force northerly winds. Temperatures around Melbourne and Adelaide quickly rose above 43°C, with winds gusting up to 100km/h and relative humidity plunging to as low as 6 per cent. From mid-morning, McArthur's fire danger index was in excess of 100 in several places in Victoria and South Australia. It {{would be one of the}} worst fire weather days in south-east Australia since the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Details of Thatcher's funeral {{had been}} agreed {{with her in}} advance. Specifically, Thatcher had chosen the hymns and stipulated that the Prime Minister of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> deliver a reading from the Bible. She had {{previously}} vetoed a state funeral; reasons included cost, parliamentary deliberation, and that it suggested similar stature to Winston Churchill (with which she disagreed). Instead with her and her family's agreement, she received a ceremonial funeral, including military honours, a guard of honour, and a service at St Paul's Cathedral, London. The arrangements {{were similar to those}} for the Queen Mother in 2002 and for Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, except with greater military honours as she had been a former head of government. Thatcher's body was cremated after the funeral, in accordance with her wishes.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, the Fiesta Bowl {{was usually}} {{played in the}} early {{afternoon}} (MST). At the time, the structure of the New Year's Day games saw the Fiesta and Cotton Bowls played first, with the Rose Bowl starting around 4:45pm and the Orange and Sugar Bowls played at night at the same time. NBC at the time was the television home for three of the aforementioned bowls, and if the national title was to be decided in one of them airing the Fiesta Bowl early in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> have been of little benefit. This brought about the shift in dates to the 2nd of January, which ensured the game would not face any competition from any other bowl game that might have been played at the time and helped it gain the record-setting audience it pulled in.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> 1950s, <b>Day</b> <b>would</b> take a {{break and}} tour around Europe, while her mother at home would write her saying that she would love {{watching}} the new television shows featuring horses — Rawhide, Have Gun Will Travel and Wagon Train. In 1959, Day, who loved horses, met with Wagon Train producer Howard Christie, who let her write her own scripts, as well as doctor others, for <b>the</b> series. <b>Day</b> <b>would</b> also be an unofficial bookie for the series' crew, betting on horse races for them, and eventually becoming part owner of a racehorse.|$|R

Typical missions would start before dawn and would have the Heinkels strafe Soviet airbases. Later in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> they <b>would</b> be sent on search and destroy missions, looking primarily for artillery and trains.|$|R

25|$|The New York Times, however, {{reported}} that {{it was unlikely that}} NBC would get baseball, as the network would have to preempt up to three weeks of NFL coverage on Sunday nights. However, the NFL used to not schedule a Sunday night game on the second night of the World Series, which meant that NBC gaining the rights was not completely out of the question (however, the following Sunday, in which a possible World Series Game 7 is scheduled, a Sunday night NFL game is also scheduled). In addition to this, other Sunday playoff games, such as the ALCS and NLCS could be pushed to the afternoon. This might not be appetizing to league officials, as major playoff games would go up head-to-head against highly rated afternoon NFL games (as opposed to today's system, in which only one game out of two for <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> go up against network NFL broadcasts).|$|E
25|$|Though Bermuda {{has been}} {{classified}} as a self-governed colony since 1620, internal self-government was bolstered by {{the establishment of a}} formal constitution in 1968, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage; debate about independence has ensued, although a 1995 independence referendum was soundly defeated. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which would be a heavy obligation for Bermuda's small population, and the loss of British passports (which could severely restrict travel, as few enough countries have even heard of little Bermuda, and could regard travellers with suspicion). Another concern, which raised its head during the 1991 Gulf War, was the loss of the protection provided by the Royal Navy, especially, to the large number of merchant vessels on Bermuda's shipping register. The Bermuda government is unlikely to be able to provide naval protection to oil tankers plying the Persian Gulf, or other potentially dangerous waters. At present, Bermuda is {{able to take advantage of}} its status as part of the United Kingdom to attract overseas shipping operators to its register, although it does not contribute to the navy's budget. With independence, it was feared, a large chunk of the money currently flowing into the Bermuda Government's coffers would disappear. The current government is promoting independence – by means of a general election (that is, the government of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> have the power to decide whether to go independent or not) as opposed to a referendum (a direct vote by the people) – by establishing a committee to investigate (though the committee is notably staffed with party members, and without representation by the opposition party). This stance is being supported by the UN, who have sent delegations to the island claiming that Bermuda is being suppressed by the British.|$|E
500|$|... 1818 was the 30th {{anniversary of}} the {{founding}} of the colony, and Governor Lachlan Macquarie chose to acknowledge the day with the first official celebration. The Governor declared that <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> be a holiday for all government workers, granting each an extra allowance of [...] "one pound of fresh meat", and ordered a 30-gun salute at Dawes Point – one for each year that the colony had existed.

500|$|St. Laurent {{resigned}} {{as leader of}} the Liberal Party on September 5, 1957, but agreed to stay on until a successor was elected.

Paul Martin stated that [...] "I'm sure I never thought <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> come when [...] would ever be a member of a government, let alone head of it. When that happened, the world had come to an end as far as I was concerned." [...] In January 1958, St. Laurent was succeeded by Lester Pearson.|$|E
500|$|The Congress {{observed}} 26 January as the Independence Day between 1930 and 1946. The celebration {{was marked}} by meetings where the attendants took the [...] "pledge of independence". Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such meetings were peaceful, solemn, and [...] "without any speeches or exhortation". Gandhi envisaged that besides the meetings, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>would</b> be spent [...] "...in doing some constructive work, whether it is spinning, or service of 'untouchables,' or reunion of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these together". Following actual independence in 1947, the Constitution of India came into effect on and from 26 January 1950; since then 26 January is celebrated as Republic Day.|$|E
500|$|Tulsidas started {{composing}} {{poetry in}} Sanskrit in Varanasi on the Prahlada Ghat.

On the eighth night, Shiva – whose famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple is located in Varanasi – [...] is believed to have ordered Tulsidas in a dream to compose poetry in the vernacular instead of Sanskrit. Tulsidas woke up and saw both Shiva and Parvati who blessed him. Shiva ordered Tulsidas to go to Ayodhya and compose poetry in Awadhi. Shiva also predicted that Tulsidas' poetry would fructify like the Sama Veda. In the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas hints at having the Darshan of Shiva and Parvati in both dream and awakened state.|$|E
