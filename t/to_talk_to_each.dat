5|$|On {{a normal}} afternoon, Marge wants Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie {{to go for}} a walk. They agree when faced with the threat of having <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British {{entrepreneur}} Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} panning view of a fence and people with {{umbrellas}} on the left, eventually zooming out on an audience looking through it in the rain. Both Volkova and Katina are then shown singing to the track in Catholic school uniforms. Throughout {{the majority of the}} visual, the girls are featured performing erratic behaviour, which includes them banging against a fence, yelling for help towards the audience, and occasionally laughing at them. While continuing to sing to each other during the second chorus, they subsequently start to kiss, and the audience slightly stares at their actions. Following this, several members of the public start <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, whilst a shot with the camera looking up Volkova's skirt and exposing her underwear is shown during the process.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E
5000|$|Stage one is [...] "Shared Monologues", where {{group members}} get used <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other.Stage two is [...] "Skillful Discussion", {{where people are}} {{learning}} the skills of dialogue.Stage three is [...] "Reflective Dialogue", which is approximately Bohm's idea of dialogue.Stage four is [...] "Generative Dialogue", a special [...] "creative" [...] dialogue Isaacs seeks for his groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{fairly simple}} {{telephone}} achieves a limited form of telepresence using just the human sensory element of hearing, in that users consider themselves <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other rather than <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the telephone itself.|$|R
50|$|Speaking with CNN, CEO John Hanke said he didn't expect players <b>to</b> start <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> {{other and}} forming clubs. Players have leased airplanes, {{helicopters}} and boats to reach portals {{in remote areas}} of Siberia and Alaska.|$|R
25|$|However, VRI {{cannot be}} used for {{situations}} in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With video relay service (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other on the phone through the interpreter.|$|E
25|$|QOTW Off Topic {{was invented}} for those users of QOTW who found they had {{things in common}} and liked <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other using the reply system. Over several weeks {{it became clear that}} more and more people were preferring to chat to each other through the replies instead of the /talk board which was already set up, so Off Topic was created.|$|E
25|$|With two others, Captain Haldane and Sergeant Brockie, Churchill {{devised a}} plan. The {{building}} {{where they were}} held {{was surrounded by a}} patrolled courtyard, and then a wall. The sentries moved about, and the conspirators determined that at a certain point the sentries would be briefly unable to see part of the wall, and a fit man would be able to climb it. On the first night they resolved to try to escape, the sentries changed their patrol pattern and escape was impossible. On the second an opportunity arose where two sentries stopped <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, and Churchill scaled the wall.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2010 in an {{interview}} with Max D Heston with a McGill University student he stated, [...] "It would be a shame to just kill the magazine, we had zero debt and it was going strong though just tough when you don't get on well with your partners. So we decided to drop it and move on. We may release some special editions of Rage one day if me and Fadi can bring ourselves around <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other again." [...] He also stated [...] " [...] I think the print business is done for now, I mean I will always love magazines though I think its time to move on to more fiction and films".|$|R
50|$|Burri’s work {{received}} {{a different and}} positive consideration in 1953, when James Johnson Sweeney (director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) discovered Burri’s paintings at the Obelisco Gallery in Rome, and subsequently introduced the artist’s work to the United States, in a collective exhibition representative of the new European artistic tendencies. This encounter subsequently led to a life-long friendship with Sweeney becoming an active a proponent of Burri’s art in leading American Museums and writing the very first monogrph about the artist in 1955.During the same year Robert Rauschenberg visited the painter’s studio two times: despite the linguistic {{differences between the two}} artists prevented them <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, Rauschenberg’s visits provided substantial input for the creation of his Combine Paintings.|$|R
60|$|When we {{came down}} stairs <b>to</b> breakfast, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other like common people, {{it was better}} than most shows to see Corny's face. She was {{standing}} at the front door, not far from the stairs, and it actually seemed as if a candle had been lighted inside of her. Her face shone.|$|R
25|$|Another form {{of closed}} {{communication}} {{used in the}} books and movies {{is a set of}} mirrors which belonged to Sirius Black. Sirius gives Harry one mirror in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with a note explaining to Harry that Sirius and James Potter used to use the mirrors <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other when they were put in separate detentions. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry uses a shard of his broken mirror to call for help from the Malfoy's cellar, and later finds out that Aberforth Dumbledore had been watching over Harry using Sirius' mirror, which he obtained from Mundungus Fletcher.|$|E
25|$|The husband {{visited the}} tharavad {{at night and}} left the {{following}} morning {{and he had no}} legal obligation to his children which lay entirely with the karnavan. In Nair families, young men and women about the same age were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, unless the young man's sister was considerably older than him. The wife of karnavan had an unusual relationship in his tharavad as she belonged to a different one and her interests lay there. Panikkar wrote that Karnavan loved his sister's son more than his own and he believes it was due mainly to the instability of Nair marriages. Divorce rate was very high as both man and woman had equal right to terminate the marriage. Enangar was another family with which a tharavad remained closely related; a few such related families formed a social group whose members participated in all social activities. Nakane wrote in 1956 that tharavads as a functional unit had ceased to exist and large buildings that had once hosted large tharavads were occupied by just a few of its remnants.|$|E
500|$|Partners are {{normally}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other during the game. They can for instance {{ask for a}} specific piece, for more trades, ask to hold a piece, suggest moves or ask their partner to stall. Shouts like [...] "Knight mates!" [...] or [...] "Don't let him have a Rook!" [...] are common, {{and can lead to}} seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board. Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board.|$|E
50|$|In the 2000s Kendall {{became a}} {{television}} {{analyst for the}} Champ Car series. He is also {{the host of the}} Speed Test Drive promotional television series where he and another professional race car driver drive a new vehicle on a race course while being able <b>to</b> remotely <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other and offer their positive thoughts on the car.|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Cliff and Ralph {{could not}} be quiet. They must talk, and as the captain walked away {{that they might not}} speak <b>to</b> him, they <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|R
60|$|Tea {{that evening}} {{was not the}} {{pleasant}} meal it usually was. The two women were wont <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> animatedly <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, and Cecily had many things to tell Lucy Ellen. She did not tell them. Neither did Lucy Ellen ask any questions, her ill-concealed excitement hanging around her like a festal garment.|$|R
500|$|The attackers used a {{satellite}} phone {{and cell phones}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other {{as well as their}} handlers that were based in Pakistan. [...] In transcripts intercepted by Indian authorities between the attackers and their handlers, the handlers provided the attackers with encouragement, tactical advice, and information gained from media coverage. The attackers used both personal cell phones and those obtained from their victims {{to communicate with each other}} and the news media. Although the attackers were encouraged to murder hostages, the attackers were in communication with the news media via cell phones to make demands in return for the release of hostages. This was believed to be done in order to further confuse Indian authorities that they were dealing with primarily a hostage situation.|$|E
500|$|Visiting Andy in the hospital, Ann {{suddenly}} kisses him, but immediately {{stops and}} guiltily walks out. Later, April, also {{relieved to see}} Andy is fine, finally agrees {{to go out with}} him. After they kiss, Andy decides to be honest and tells her about the earlier kiss with Ann. April angrily storms out, taking back her decision to go out with him. That night, Leslie sits on a bench in the empty Lot 48 and Mark joins her, with both appearing happy to be able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. Mark tells her that if more people like her worked in local government, he wouldn't be leaving, and gives her plans he drew up for a park at Lot 48 before giving her a goodbye kiss on the cheek and walking way forever. The next day, Ron withdraws from the budget task force and appoints Leslie in his place. As Tom (Aziz Ansari) and his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) are clearing out his office, he notices Ron is wearing a red shirt and black pants, the [...] "Tiger Woods" [...] outfit he always wears the day after having sex. Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) then appears and kisses Ron and the two leave together, shocking Tom.|$|E
500|$|New York City doubled for Metropolis, {{while the}} New York Daily News Building {{served as the}} {{location}} for {{the offices of the}} Daily Planet. Brooklyn Heights was also used. Filming in New York lasted five weeks, {{during the time of the}} New York City blackout of 1977. Production moved to Alberta for scenes set in Smallville, with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of Beynon, Alberta, the high school football scenes at Barons, Alberta, and the Kent farm constructed at Blackie, Alberta. Brief filming also took place in Gallup, New Mexico, Lake Mead and Grand Central Terminal. Director Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule. Creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz reflected, [...] "Donner never got a budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, 'Why don't you just schedule the film for the next two days, and then I'll be nine months over?'." [...] Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers, was then brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who by now were refusing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. With his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, [...] "At one time if I'd seen him, I would have killed him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Apurímac (...) is {{a region}} in southern-central Peru. It is bordered {{on the east}} by the Cusco Region, on the west by the Ayacucho Region, and on the south by the Arequipa and Ayacucho regions. The region's name {{originates}} from the Quechua language and means [...] "where the gods speak" [...] {{in reference to the}} many mountains of the region (gods in the andean religion) that seem <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|R
60|$|They did so, and {{sat down}} on its further side, {{watching}} till, as nothing happened, their dread of the lions passed away, and they began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> again, telling <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other the stories of their lives.|$|R
5|$|The film {{features}} animation by American {{graphic designer}} and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two {{films in the}} documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|R
2500|$|To conduct interviews, Morris {{invented a}} machine, called the Interrotron, which allows Morris and his subject <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> {{other through the}} camera lens itself. He {{explains}} the device as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{textbook}} on {{graph theory}} {{was written by}} Dénes Kőnig, and published in 1936. Another book by Frank Harary, published in 1969, was [...] "considered the world over to be the definitive textbook on the subject", and enabled mathematicians, chemists, electrical engineers and social scientists <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. Harary donated all of the royalties to fund the Pólya Prize.|$|E
2500|$|The International Organisation for Migration {{said that}} no new boats had been spotted. The EU's Catherine Ashton was {{on a visit to}} Tunisia to discuss the issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that [...] "not {{everyone}} who {{does not want to be}} in Tunisia can come to Europe. Rather, we need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other how we can strengthen the rule of law in Tunisia again and whether Europe can be of help." ...|$|E
50|$|Multiple bus-master {{support and}} {{improved}} arbitration means that several such devices could coexist {{and share the}} system bus. Micro Channel bus-master-capable devices can even use the bus <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other (peer <b>to</b> peer) at speeds faster than the system CPU, without any other system intervention. In theory, Micro Channel architecture systems could be expanded, like mainframes, with only the addition of intelligent masters, without periodic need to upgrade the central processor.|$|R
5000|$|However, it was {{the first}} contact with the {{brutality}} of the prison guards, as [...] "it was pouring curses and fists, generously distributed to all those who were not executing orders fast enough", with the strictness of the detention, as the inmates were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> loud <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, sing, look outside the window, attempt to communicate with other cells, lay down in bed during the day, or perform many other ordinary tasks.|$|R
50|$|In April 1939, 38 {{members of}} Karpacka Sicz {{organization}} were detained in the camp. They were ethnic Ukrainians, previously {{residing in the}} Carpathian Ruthenia region of Czechoslovakia, where they were attempting to create an independent Ukrainian state. After this region was annexed by Hungary, Hungarian authorities deported them to Poland, whey they were sent to Bereza Kartuska. Unlike other prisoners, they didn't have to perform any labours and had the right <b>to</b> freely <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other in low voice.|$|R
2500|$|The bass from loud hip-hop music ("Beef" [...] by Lil Reese) {{playing in}} the teens' SUV started to shake both cars and bother Dunn, who asked {{for it to be}} turned down. Front seat {{passenger}} Tevin Thompson initially complied, but then Jordan Davis objected and Thompson turned the music back up to a volume Dunn would later state in court was a [...] "ridiculously loud" [...] level. According to the other teens, Davis and Dunn continued <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, with Davis cursing, becoming [...] "extremely upset" [...] and allegedly referring to Dunn as a [...] "cracker". Dunn remained relatively calm. Meanwhile, Stornes returned to the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he {{requested}} more money, Carl Wilson {{was obliged to}} give away a quarter of Brian's publishing royalties. In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like {{me to be in}} touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier {{answers the}} {{question}} [...] "What is Riot grrrl?" [...] with: [...] " [...] Because we girls {{want to create}} mediums that speak to US. [...] We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because we need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. Communication and inclusion are key. [...] We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms. [...] All three of these forms were {{claimed to be a}} source of empowerment for women in the movement.|$|E
50|$|The Falkenburg Road Jail {{opened in}} 1998 with 768 beds. An {{expansion}} of the facility in 2003 added 1,536 more beds to its present rated capacity of 2,304. Falkenburg's dormitories are constructed of pre-cast concrete tilt-up walls. Deputies manage 72 inmates in a direct supervision environment. The daily operational cost is $74.04 per inmate. The Falkenburg Road Jail uses video court and video visitation. Prisoners and visitors are not permitted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|R
60|$|He was {{interrupted}} here by Corrie and Alice rushing into the room, {{the latter of}} whom threw herself into the widow's arms and burst into tears, while Master Corrie indulged in some eccentric bounds and cheers by way of relieving his feelings. For some time Henry allowed them <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> eagerly <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other; then he told Corrie and Alice that he had something of importance to say to his mother, and led her into an adjoining room.|$|R
