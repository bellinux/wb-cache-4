5000|$|Depending on the angle, a heel can act cowardly or overpowering {{to their}} opponents. For instance, a [...] "closet champion" [...] in {{particular}} is a term <b>for</b> a <b>heel</b> <b>in</b> possession of a title belt who consistently dodges top flight competition and attempts to back down from challenges. One of many examples is Seth Rollins during his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship run, Charlotte during her Divas/Raw Women's Championship reign and Honky Tonk Man during his long Intercontinental Championship reign. This helps to affirm the intended kayfabe reactions that the face(s) that said heel is feuding with is/are more deserving of the title. <b>Heels</b> may <b>in</b> fact beg for mercy during a beat down {{at the hands of}} faces, even if they have delivered similar beat downs with no mercy, with Ric Flair in particular being well known <b>for</b> this. Other <b>heels</b> may act overpowering to their opponents as to play up the scrappy underdog success story for the face instead. Brock Lesnar has played <b>heel</b> <b>in</b> both capacities, but has become quite famous (either as a heel or a face) as an almost-unstoppable machine who can take down anything in his path.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Posterior Heel {{pain can}} present in {{children}} of 8 to 14 years, associated with or clinically diagnosed as Sever's disease, or calcaneal apophysitis. Presently, {{there are no}} comparative randomised studies evaluating treatment options <b>for</b> posterior <b>heel</b> pain <b>in</b> children with the clinical diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis or Sever's disease. This study seeks to compare the clinical efficacy of some currently employed treatment options for the relief of disability and pain associated with posterior <b>heel</b> pain <b>in</b> children. Method Design: Factorial 2 × 2 randomised controlled trial with monthly follow-up for 3 months. Participants: Children with clinically diagnosed posterior heel pain possibly associated with calcaneal apophysitis/Sever's disease (n = 124). Interventions: Treatment factor 1 will be two types of shoe orthoses: a heel raise or prefabricated orthoses. Both of these interventions are widely available, mutually exclusive treatment approaches that are relatively low in cost. Treatment factor 2 will be a footwear prescription/replacement intervention involving a shoe with a firm heel counter, dual density EVA midsole and rear foot control. The alternate condition in this factor is no footwear prescription/replacement, with the participant wearing their current footwear. Outcomes: Oxford Foot and Ankle Questionnaire and the Faces pain scale. Discussion This will be a randomised trial to compare the efficacy of various treatment options <b>for</b> posterior <b>heel</b> pain <b>in</b> children that {{may be associated with}} calcaneal apophysitis also known as Sever's disease.

40|$|When {{compared}} to sucrose water, providing breastfeeding during a painful procedure provides more effective infant analgesia. An Italian study compared infant pain scores during a heel stick procedure using either sucrose water or breastfeeding to control pain. In this randomized controlled study, 101 term infants undergoing heel lance were either breastfed or fed 1 ml of a 25 % sucrose solution with a syringe. Pain was monitored using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PPIP), heart rate increase, oxygen saturation decrease, and crying behavior. Infants who were breastfed during this procedure had a five point difference {{in terms of}} their PPIP score (scale range: 0 - 18) with the average being about three points (minimal pain response). The heart rate increase and the oxygen saturation decrease were significantly lower in the breastfed group {{compared to}} the sucrose group.

40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) has {{millions}} of gallons of high level nuclear waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford, Washington and Savannah River, South Carolina. These tanks will eventually be emptied and decommissioned. This will leave a residue of sludge adhering to the interior tank surfaces that may contaminate nearby groundwaters with radionuclides and RCRA metals. Performance assessment (PA) calculations must be carried out prior to closing the tanks. This requires developing radionuclide release models from the sludges so that the PA calculations can be based on credible source terms. These efforts continued to be hindered by uncertainties regarding the actual nature of the tank contents and the distribution of radionuclides among the various phases. In particular, it is of vital importance to know what radionuclides are associated with solid sludge components. Experimentation on actual tank sludges can be difficult, dangerous and prohibitively expensive. The research funded under this grant {{for the past three years}} was intended to provide a cost-effective method for developing the needed radionuclide release models using non-radioactive artificial sludges.

40|$|During gait phases, {{the point}} of initial contact (IC) between the foot and the floor is {{positioned}} outward {{with respect to the}} load line. Since typical heeled shoes are designed with the <b>heel</b> <b>in</b> the middle, the foot and the <b>heel</b> positions differ <b>in</b> {{the point of}} contact.

40|$|Plantar {{pressure}} measurement provides important {{information about the}} structure and function of the foot and is a helpful tool to evaluate patients with foot complaints. In general, average and maximum plantar pressure of 6 - 11 areas under the foot are used to compare groups of subjects. However, masking the foot means a loss of important information about the plantar pressure distribution pattern. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to develop and test a simple method that normalizes the plantar pressure pattern for foot size, foot progression angle, and total plantar pressure. Moreover, scaling the plantar pressure to a standard foot opens the door for more sophisticated analysis techniques such as pattern recognition and machine learning. Twelve subjects walked at preferred and half of the preferred walking speed over a pressure plate. To test the method, subjects walked in a straight line and in an approaching angle of approximately 40 degrees. To calculate the normalized foot, the plantar pressure pattern was rotated over the foot progression angle and normalized for foot size. After normalization, the mean shortest distance between the contour lines of straight walking and walking at an angle had a mean of 0. 22 cm (SD: 0. 06 cm) for the forefoot and 0. 14 cm (SD: 0. 06 cm) <b>for</b> the <b>heel.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the contour lines of normalized feet for the various subjects were almost identical.
