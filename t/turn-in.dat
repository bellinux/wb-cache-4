2500|$|In February 2009, Road and Track tested another {{production}} vehicle and conducted the first independently verified metered {{testing of the}} Roadster. Engineering editor Dennis Simanitis said the testing confirmed what he called [...] "extravagant claims", that the Roadster had a 4.0 s [...] acceleration and a [...] range. They said the Roadster felt like [...] "an over-ballasted Lotus Elise", but the weight was well-distributed, so the car remained responsive. [...] "Fit and finish of our Tesla were exemplary", which Road and Track thought fit the target market. Overall, they considered it a [...] "delight" [...] to drive. Testing a pre-production car in early 2008, Road and Track said [...] "The Tesla feels composed and competent at speed with great <b>turn-in</b> and transitioning response", though they recommended against it as a [...] "primary grocery-getter".|$|E
60|$|Among the regiments that marched {{that day}} to Ungheni was one to which I would draw special attention. It was not much better, perhaps, than the others, {{but it was a}} good typical Russian regiment, and had a {{commander}} at its head who looked as if he could do it justice. They marched at a smart pace, four miles an hour, with a long, dogged, steady tramp that was clumsy to look at, but seemed likely to last. Few of the men were tall, but they were burly, square-set fellows, broad of shoulder, deep of chest, and smart of limb. They wore a French-like blue cap, with a red band round it, and a blue tunic, with loose blue trousers stuffed into boots that reached the knee. Their knapsacks were hairy, and their belts black, the latter suggesting deliverance from that absurdity of old, pipeclay. Their great-coats, heavy and brown, were worn in a roll over the left shoulder, and each man carried his own kettle, the latter being suggestive of tea and tuck-in, followed by tobacco and <b>turn-in.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term {{teach-in}} was {{a variant}} of another form of protest, the sit-in. Later variants included the die-in, bed-in, lie-in, and draft card <b>turn-in.</b>|$|E
50|$|The corner entry phase often {{begins with}} straight-line {{threshold}} braking where {{the goal is}} to achieve maximum deceleration rate. This is followed by the <b>turn-in</b> where the driver begins to steer the vehicle toward the apex. Traditionally, many drivers were taught to complete all braking before this <b>turn-in</b> portion and take a more circular path with a constant speed to the apex. Later, many racing drivers started to incorporate trail-braking into their corner entry. Trail-braking involves carrying brake pressure past the <b>turn-in</b> point which allows the forces generated by the tires to decelerate the car in a more optimized direction. This more optimized direction of force causes a vehicle to travel on a Euler spiral shaped path of decreasing radius to the apex. If done properly, this results in a higher average speed and lower elapsed time to the apex compared to the traditional circular entry.|$|E

5000|$|Hill {{defines the}} correct {{methodology}} for {{learning how to}} ride a motorcycle as {{the order of the}} sport, which comprises six training fundamentals taught in the following order: (1) bike placement, (2) vision and focus, (3) motor controls, (4) brakes, (5) <b>turn-in</b> rate and <b>turn-in</b> point, and (6) body position and body timing. According to Hill, mastering the order of the sport requires training {{both on and off the}} bike. Developing a theoretical understanding of riding a motorcycle (i.e., the physics of how and why a motorcycle reacts to given inputs) facilitates the development of correct physical skills and handling.|$|E
50|$|Many {{contemporary}} ballet concepts {{come from}} the ideas and innovations of 20th-century modern dance, including floor work and <b>turn-in</b> of the legs. This ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal).|$|E
50|$|The front brakes {{were also}} new. Suzuki decided {{to drop the}} six-piston calipers. The new {{radially}} mounted four-piston calipers weigh 30 grams less and grip smaller 300 mm discs that save another 300 g. Though smaller, Suzuki claimed that the new brakes provide better stopping and <b>turn-in</b> performance.|$|E

5000|$|In 1993, Burris, an {{advocate}} for a national handgun ban, helped to organize Chicago's first Gun <b>Turn-in</b> Day. The following year, Burris admitted that he kept a handgun in his home and had not turned it into police as he had urged others to do. A spokesman stated that Burris had [...] "forgotten about" [...] the handgun.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s {{he opposed}} the Vietnam War, {{organizing}} poetry read-ins, donating his war {{tax dollars to}} a veterans' hospital and to Philadelphia public schools (for which {{he was convicted of}} tax evasion) and organizing a draft card <b>turn-in</b> at the Justice Department (for which he was an unindicted co-conspirator at the [...] "Boston Five" [...] trial).|$|E
5000|$|One common race {{situation}} that requires left-foot braking {{is when a}} racer is cornering under power. If the driver {{does not want to}} lift off the throttle, potentially causing trailing-throttle oversteer, left-foot braking can induce a mild oversteer situation, and help the car [...] "tuck", or <b>turn-in</b> better. Mild left-foot braking can also help reduce understeer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cars were}} fitted with either gold or black-centred (depending on body colour) Simmons 'P-4' 3-piece {{composite}} alloy 7.5x15" [...] wheels. The overall outside edge-to-edge distance is 4 in wider {{at the front}} and 9 in at the rear over a 900 Turbo of the day - mainly to decrease the roll centre height and improve <b>turn-in</b> response. Tyres were 225/50VR15 Pirelli Cinturato both front and rear.|$|E
5000|$|The falls {{is located}} at McGalliard Falls Park in Valdese, North Carolina. The park may be found by taking exit 112 off of Interstate 40 and going north to Main Street in Valdese. Head west on Main Street for [...]8 miles and turn right onto Church St. Go north 1.5 miles to the <b>turn-in</b> for the park on the right. There is a short path to the falls.|$|E
50|$|The grazing {{guidelines}} {{in the table}} are for rotationally grazed, cool-season forages. When using continuous grazing, manage pasture height at one-half the recommended <b>turn-in</b> height for rotational grazing to optimize plant health. The growth habit of some forage species, such as alfalfa, does not permit their survival under continuous grazing. When managing for legumes in the stand, it is beneficial to use rotational grazing and graze the stand close and then give adequate rest to stimulate the legumes' growth.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary ballet is a {{genre of}} dance that {{incorporates}} elements of classical ballet and modern dance. It employs classical ballet technique {{and in many}} cases classical pointe technique as well, but allows greater range of movement of the upper body and is not constrained to the rigorously defined body lines and forms found in traditional, classical ballet. Many of its attributes come from the ideas and innovations of 20th century modern dance, including floor work and <b>turn-in</b> of the legs.|$|E
50|$|The Coupe's {{fixed roof}} {{increases}} torsional rigidity, {{resulting in a}} stiffness of 32000 Nm per degree of body twist on the coupe (compared to 14500 Nm per degree on the roadster), which improves <b>turn-in</b> and overall handling response. The roof has a 'double bubble' contour which serves as an aerodynamic aid and offers more headroom than the roadster with top closed. The Coup√© has a sleek fastback rear window that slopes down to an integrated spoiler shaped to deliver downforce to the rear axle at speed.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the BF series, FPV introduced the [...] "R-spec" [...] in limited numbers. The biggest upgrade comprised new suspension dampers supplied by Delphi, which provided better steering feel, <b>turn-in</b> and response without compromising general road comfort. FPV also added a higher capacity oil cooler to automatic transmission models to cater for track use. This upgraded handling package was tested by legendary Australian racing identity John Bowe, who was able to cut 3 seconds a lap over the normal models at Winton Raceway.|$|E
5000|$|Trulli said, [...] "Today {{was a great}} race, {{hard and}} tough. We had a good pace, {{even if we had}} to battle with some cars that were quicker than us. I had to fight really hard but that is what people should expect both from myself and from Toyota." [...] Hamilton commented on his drive-through penalty: [...] "My drive-through penalty was an {{extremely}} close call: I felt I'd got past Vettel fairly and was ahead going into the corner. But I was on the outside and couldn't <b>turn-in</b> in case we both crashed, then I lost the back-end and drove over the kerb." ...|$|E
50|$|The WRX Type RA STi {{was dropped}} {{for a new}} WRX STi Spec C. This model was much lighter than the WRX Type RA as it {{received}} lighter glass and body panels. The Spec C's handling was much improved due {{to an increase in}} caster (from 3.5 degrees to 5 degrees). This was achieved not by changing the suspension mounting point, but by lengthening the wheelbase (15 mm). This was done by including different control arms. This increased caster significantly helped the <b>turn-in</b> capabilities of the car. The Spec C also has a steering rack ratio of 13:1. The transmission is supplied with its own oil cooler.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier U.S. {{military}} vehicles, {{used from}} World War I through the Vietnam War, used a scheme of [...] "olive drab", often with large white stars. Prototypes, early production M1 (105 mm gun) and M1-IP models {{switched to a}} flat forest green paint scheme. The large white insignia stars have also transitioned to much smaller black markings. Some units painted their M1s with the older Mobility Equipment Research and Design Command (MERDC) 4-color paint scheme but the <b>turn-in</b> requirements for these tanks required repainting them to overall forest green. Therefore, even though {{a large number of}} the base model M1s were camouflaged in the field, few or none exist today.|$|E
5000|$|The SHO Performance Package {{includes}} upgraded brake pads, recalibrated electronic {{power-assisted steering}} for improved responsiveness, a [...] "Sport Mode" [...] {{setting for the}} Electronic Stability Control, ability {{to turn off the}} AdvanceTrac stability control system, 27mm front anti-roll bar instead of the standard 29mm front anti-roll bar for more neutral <b>turn-in,</b> vented front brake dust shields from the Police Interceptor, cooling package from the Police Interceptor (engine oil, transmission oil, and power transfer unit), a shorter 3.16 to 1 final drive ratio for faster acceleration, and summer-compound 20" [...] Goodyear Eagle F1 performance tires with premium painted wheels.0 to 60 mph time is rated at 5.2 seconds.|$|E

50|$|The {{students}} are driven {{to reach their}} quota {{for a number of}} reasons. First, the school offers incentive prizes (sweatpants, sweatshirts, shorts, etc.) that are given by submitting certain amounts of money on specific <b>turn-in</b> days. Students who meet their quotas are also given a day off in January while anyone who did not meet their quota must still attend school and complete a project. If the entire school manages to raise 100% or more of their goal, they receive an extra day off on Thanksgiving break. Also, the winning homeroom class is treated with a pizza party and additional money toward class funds (for dances, etc.). The positive reinforcement of these prizes creates friendly competition between the classes and a strong motivation to raise money for a good purpose.|$|E

50|$|Mowing with a scythe is {{a skilled}} task {{made to look}} easy by {{experienced}} mowers but needs time to learn the skill. Long-bladed traditional scythes, typically around 90 cm (such as in the example below) and suitable for mowing grass or wheat are harder to use at first, consequently, beginners usually start on shorter blades, say 70 cm or less. Common beginner's errors include: setting up the snaith with the handles in the wrong locations to suit the body, setting the blade at the wrong <b>turn-in</b> and turn-up angles to suit the conditions, choosing a blade that is too long for the skill level, failing {{to start with a}} sharp edge and persevering with a dull one during use, chopping or hacking at the grass, trying to cut too wide a strip of grass at once and striking the ground with the blade. Traditionally, beginners relied on mentors to help them set up and maintain their scythe and to teach them to mow comfortably and efficiently.|$|E
50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy. The active steering system output {{is a function of the}} vehicle‚Äôs tilt angle error (the difference between the actual and ideal tilt angle), therefore at steady state when there is little or no tilt angle error the front wheel steer angle matches the driver‚Äôs steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon <b>turn-in,</b> a tilt angle error exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver‚Äôs steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired tilt angle, the magnitude of the tilt angle error is reduced and the front wheel steer angle takes on the value demanded by the driver.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding their {{collaboration}} with RedOne, McLean remarked {{that it had}} been largely a last minute affair. Due to timing, the group was not able to make any recordings with the in-demand producer; however, near to the album's <b>turn-in</b> date, RedOne revealed that he had worked on three songs for the group and was more than willing to collaborate. It was also revealed that there had previously been 5 or 6 songs in the running for the lead single, although a Kevin Borg production titled [...] "PDA" [...] was most likely to be released; however, the RedOne production felt like [...] "it was meant to be". Interestingly one Tedder song, [...] "Shadows", which was co-written by McLean was written for this album, but failed to make it, so Simon Cowell bought the song for Leona Lewis's second album Echo but in the end felt it more suited for a boyband and it was featured on Westlife's 10th album Where We Are.|$|E
50|$|McPhillamy Park is a fast, {{downhill}} {{left-hand turn}} which is guarded by a crest {{prior to the}} <b>turn-in</b> point, rendering the corner blind to approaching drivers. Drivers have {{to stay close to}} the wall while turning so as not to run wide on exit. However, going too close may cause the car to clip the inside kerbing, which Allan Moffat did in practice for the 1986 James Hardie 1000, crashing the Holden VK Commodore, which he was sharing with long-time rival Peter Brock, head on into the concrete. British driver Win Percy, driving Allan Grice's Roadways VL Commodore, would complete an almost carbon copy of Moffat's crash in practice for the 1987 James Hardie 1000. McPhillamy Park is the location of the longest-running campsite for those who camp at the track (sometimes for over a week in advance of a race). The park was named after Walter J. McPhillamy, a previous mayor of the Bathurst City Council and the owner of most of the land occupied by the Bald Hills which was donated.|$|E
50|$|Electoral {{reform in}} Alabama refers to efforts {{to change the}} voting laws in the Yellowhammer State. In 2006, HB 711 was {{introduced}} to use preferential ballots for overseas military voters' it {{was passed by the}} Alabama House of Representatives. In March 2007, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments as to whether Alabama election law unfairly restricts third-party and independent candidates from the state ballot. Candidates are required to collect signatures from 3% {{of the total number of}} voters who voted in the previous gubernatorial election in order to gain ballot access. Ordinarily, such candidates would gather signatures at the polling place at the party primary, but Alabama made it more difficult by moving the deadline for signature <b>turn-in</b> to the date of the primary. Alabama ranks third nationally in disenfranchising formerly incarcerated persons. One out of every 14 Alabama residents is disenfranchised. To regain the right to vote, individuals convicted of crimes of ‚Äúmoral turpitude‚Äù who have completed a felony sentence must apply to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote. As soon as you apply for a Pardon you automatically receive the right to vote back. This is the new rule of law and was passed through the House and the Senate due to voter disenfranchisement. In 2007, HB 192 was introduced to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, but it failed in the Constitution & Elections committee.|$|E

40|$|Importance: External nasal valve {{dysfunction}} (EVD) is {{a common}} cause of nasal obstruction. Objective: To evaluate costal cartilage lateral crural strut grafts vs cephalic crural <b>turn-in</b> to support the weak lateral crus in patients with EVD. Design, setting and participants: In this prospective cohort study, patients with clinically diagnosed EVD were assessed at the Tertiary Rhinologic Center and underwent a costal cartilage underlay graft to the lateral crus or a cephalic <b>turn-in</b> cruralplasty. Main outcomes and measures: Assessment of patient benefit was based on 22 -Item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT- 22) and Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation Scale (NOSE) scores. A Likert scale was also used to assess overall function and cosmesis. Objective assessment included postdecongestion nasal peak inspiratory flow, nasal airway resistance, and minimum cross-sectional area. Results: Forty-one patients (mean [SD] 35. 38 [12. 73] years of age; 25 [61 %] female) were assessed. Cephalic <b>turn-in</b> maneuver was used for 25 (61 %) patients; costal cartilage lateral crural strut grafts, 16 (39 %) patients. Costal cartilage grafts were used in patients undergoing revision but other baseline data were similar. Follow-up was mean 10. 58 (7. 52) months. All patients had significantly improved visual analog scale, SNOT- 22, NOSE, patient-reported function, and cosmesis scores. The only objective test that improved was nasal peak inspiratory flow (114. 76 [60. 48] L/min vs 126. 46 [61. 17] L/min; P =. 02). Conclusions and relevance: Both techniques were effective in improving patient-reported outcomes and nasal peak inspiratory flow. Both are functionally and cosmetically viable options for correction of EVD. 6 page(s...|$|E
