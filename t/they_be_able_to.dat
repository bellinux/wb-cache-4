5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> claim the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E

25|$|Emma, Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina and Robin are in {{the library}} of the mansion, searching for a way to stop Gold and Isaac from {{enacting}} a new reality with the newly activated ink. They are joined by August, who shows them a drawing of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, who {{might be able to help}} them. Hook remembers the Apprentice from when he and Gold trapped him in the sorcerer's hat. With the help of the Blue Fairy, they release the Apprentice, who immediately says that there’s no time to waste. He tells them that they must find the storybook page depicting the door, as well as the door's key, for only then will <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> lock Isaac back into the book where he belongs.

The 4th Civil Chamber of the Court of Brussels ruled that the lawsuit was [...] "admissible but unfounded." [...] However, production had already begun — cast negotiations were finished, and the team had already approached the French government about receiving subsidies — and Lafosse demonstrated no intent to hand over his work.

2500|$|Gremlins 2: The New Batch [...] is a 1990 American comedy horror film, and {{the sequel}} to the 1984 film Gremlins. It was {{directed}} by Joe Dante and written by Charles S. Haas, with creature designs by Rick Baker. It stars Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, John Glover, Robert Prosky, Haviland Morris, Dick Miller, Jackie Joseph, Robert Picardo and Christopher Lee; additionally, the film features Tony Randall and Frank Welker providing the voices for two gremlins. The story continues the adventures of the creature Gizmo (once again voiced by Howie Mandel), who spawns numerous small monsters when wet. In the first film, Gizmo's offspring rampaged through a small fictional town. In Gremlins 2, Gizmo multiplies within a skyscraper in New York City. The new creatures thus pose {{a serious threat to}} the city should <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> leave the building, and much of the story involves the human characters' efforts to prevent this disaster.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors {{announced}} that, since {{church members}} had repeatedly violated previous agreements, {{it would no}} longer negotiate with the church to try to prevent vicarious baptism. Speaking on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, Ernest Michel, a Holocaust survivor who reported on the Nuremberg Trials, speaking as the honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, called on the LDS Church to [...] "implement a mechanism to undo what [...] have done", and declared that the LDS Church had repeatedly violated their agreements, and that talks with Mormon leaders were now ended. Jewish groups, he said, would now turn to {{the court of public opinion}} for justice. Michel called the practice a revision of history that plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers, stating: [...] "They tell me, that my parents' Jewishness has not been altered but ... 100 years from now, how will <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> guarantee that my mother and father of blessed memory who lived as Jews and were slaughtered by Hitler for no other reason than they were Jews, will someday not be identified as Mormon victims of the Holocaust?" ...|$|E
