50|$|In {{the case}} of the Atrostim and Mark IV devices, several {{surgical}} techniques may be used. Surgery is typically performed by placing an electrode around the phrenic nerve, either in the neck (i.e., cervically; an older technique), or in the chest (i.e., thoracically; more modern). This electrode is connected to a radiofrequency receiver which is implanted just under the skin. An external transmitter sends radio signals to the device by an antenna which is worn over the receiver. For the cervical surgical technique, the phrenic nerve is approached via a small (~5 cm) incision slightly above, and midline to, the clavic. The phrenic nerve is then isolated under the scalenus anticus muscle. For the thoracic surgical technique, a small (~5 cm) incisions over the 2nd or 3rd intercostal space. The electrodes are placed around the phrenic nerves alongside the pericardium. Use of a <b>thorascope</b> allows for this technique to be performed in a minimally-invasive manner.|$|E
40|$|The current {{management}} of pleural disease often requires direct visualization and biopsy of the pleural space using thoracoscopy. A diagnostic and therapeutic approach to pleural disease is described {{that uses a}} new 2 mm rigid <b>thorascope.</b> The technique allows complete visualization, biopsy and drainage of the pleural space with rapid recovery and minimal pain...|$|E
