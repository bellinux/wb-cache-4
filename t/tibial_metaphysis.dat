40|$|Many {{epidemiological}} {{studies have reported}} that the severity of arterial diseases such as arterial calcification and stiffness is inversely related to bone loss, i. e., osteoporosis.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the influences of estrogen deficiency and/or low-calcium diet (0. 1 % Ca) on bone metabolism and calcium balance, as well as aortic wall composition and stiffness in young female rats. Twenty-eight 6 -week-old female rats were randomized into four groups: OVX-Low calcium (OL) and OVX-Normal calcium groups (ON) were ovariectomized, and Sham-Low calcium (SL) and Sham-Normal calcium groups (SN) were sham-operated. After 12 weeks, the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and <b>tibial</b> proximal <b>metaphysis</b> were significantly lower in ON than in SN, and also significantly lower in OL than in ON. Additionally, OL rats had significant higher (vs. SN and SL) urinary deoxypyridinoline, but not urinary calcium, excretion at 4 weeks after ovariectomy. However, at 12 weeks after ovariectomy, urinary calcium excretion was significantly higher in OL than in SL, with corresponding increases in two bone turnover markers, bone-type alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Neither estrogen deficiency nor low-calcium diet affected aortic stiffness or elastin degeneration and calcium deposition over the course of the present study, although changes of bone metabolism occurred rapidly.

40|$|Both ovariectomized {{animals and}} animals fed with Ca-depleted diets are {{commonly}} used in vivo models for the investigation of osteoporosis-related bone loss. The present study aimed to study the genomic responses of bone in aged female rats to ovariectomy and dietary Ca deficiency in these models. Aged (11 months old) Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy or sham-operation and fed with diets containing different dietary Ca content (LCD, 0. 1 % Ca or HCD, 1. 2 % Ca) for 12 weeks. Serum and urine were collected for biochemical marker measurement, and tibias were collected for bone mineral density (BMD) analysis by pQCT {{as well as for}} gene expression analysis by real-time PCR. Ovariectomy increased serum N-telopeptides of bone type I collagen (NTx) levels in aged rats fed with HCD (P < 0. 05). In addition, ovariectomy reduced BMD and predicted bone strength of <b>tibial</b> proximal <b>metaphysis</b> in aged rats fed with either LCD or HCD. Dietary Ca deficiency did not alter serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) or NTx levels, but induced a loss of BMD at tibia proximal metaphysis in aged rats. Ovariectomy promoted the mRNA expression of alpha- 1 type I collagen (COL), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL); and inhibited the mRNA expression of cathepsin K and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) in the proximal tibia of aged rats. Low-Ca diet significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of COL, core binding factor I (Cbfa 1), OPG and carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) in proximal tibia of aged rats. Our study revealed that the genomic responses of bone in proximal tibia to ovariectomy and dietary Ca deficiency were different. The bone loss induced by ovariectomy appears to be mediated primarily by an increase in RANKL mRNA expression; whereas the induction by dietary Ca restriction might be mediated by the induction of carbonic anhydrase II expression.

The radiograph of left knee revealed tibia vara with medial beaking and a significant depression of the medial <b>tibial</b> epiphysis and <b>metaphysis.</b> A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed significant depression of the medial tibial epiphysis but no bony bar in the physis or fusion of the medical tibial epiphysis.

40|$|The {{components}} of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) {{are expressed in}} the kidney and bone. Kidney disease and bone injury are common complications associated with diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on the kidney and bone of db/db mice. The db/db mice were orally administered by gavage with captopril for 8 weeks with db/+ mice as the non-diabetic control. Serum and urine biochemistries were determined by standard colorimetric methods or ELISA. Histological measurements were performed on the kidney by periodic acid-schiff staining and on the <b>tibial</b> proximal <b>metaphysis</b> by safranin O and masson-trichrome staining. Trabecular bone mass and bone quality were analyzed by microcomputed tomography. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting were applied for molecular analysis on mRNA and protein expression. Captopril significantly improved albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in db/db mice, and these effects might {{be attributed to the}} down-regulation of angiotensin II expression and the expression of its down-stream profibrotic factors in the kidney, like connective tissue growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. Urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus markedly increased in db/db mice in response to captopril. Treatment with captopril induced a decrease in bone mineral density and deterioration of trabecular bone at proximal metaphysis of tibia in db/db mice, as shown in the histological and reconstructed 3 -dimensional images. Even though captopril effectively reversed the diabetes-induced changes in calcium-binding protein 28 -k and vitamin D receptor expression in the kidney as well as the expression of RAS components and bradykinin receptor- 2 in bone tissue, treatment with captopril increased the osteoclast-covered bone surface, reduced the osteoblast-covered bone surface, down-regulated the expression of type 1 collagen and transcription factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (markers for osteoblastic functions), and up-regulated the expression of carbonic anhydrase II (marker for bone resorption). Captopril exerted therapeutic effects on renal injuries associated with type 2 diabetes but worsened the deteriorations of trabecular bone in db/db mice; the latter of which was at least in part due to the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis and the suppression of osteogenesis by captopril.

Using an acute chemotherapy model in young rats with the commonly used antimetabolite methotrexate (MTX), {{this study investigated}} damaging effects of five once-daily MTX injections and potential protective effects of supplementary treatment with antidote folinic acid (FA) on cellular activities in the <b>tibial</b> growth plate, <b>metaphysis,</b> and bone marrow. MTX suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of chondrocytes, and reduced collagen-II expression and growth plate thickness. It reduced production of primary spongiosa bone, volume of secondary spongiosa bone, and proliferation of metaphyseal osteoblasts, preosteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells, with the cellular activities being most severely damaged on day 9 and returning to or towards near normal levels by day 14. On the other hand, proliferation of marrow pericytes was increased early after MTX treatment and during repair. FA supplementation significantly suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis, preserved chondrocyte proliferation and expression of collagen-II, and attenuated damaging effects on production of calcified cartilage and primary bone. The supplementation also significantly reduced MTX effects on proliferation of metaphyseal osteoblastic cells and of bone marrow stromal cells, and enhanced pericyte proliferation. These observations suggest that FA supplementation effectively attenuates MTX damage on cellular activities in producing calcified cartilage and primary trabecular bone and on pools of osteoblastic cells and marrow stromal cells, and that it enhances proliferation of mesenchymal progenitor cells during bone/bone marrow recovery.

Thus, osteoclastic activity is dominant over osteoblastic and chondroblastic activity in the SHR that results in a cancellous bone deficit in the skeleton. It will require additional work to ascertain the underlying cause for this condition as several factors in the SHR with a potential for causing this change are present, including elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), depressed 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3, low calcium absorption, reduced body weight (reduced loading) elevated blood pressure and possibly other direct cell differences in the mutant strain.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} PTHrP in skeletal development, we examined the proximal <b>tibial</b> epiphysis and <b>metaphysis</b> of wild-type (PTHrP-normal) 18 - 19 -d-old fetal mice and of chondrodystrophic litter mates homozygous for a disrupted PTHrP allele generated via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (PTHrP-depleted). In the PTHrP-normal epiphysis, immunocytochemistry showed PTHrP to be localized in chondrocytes within the resting zone and at the junction between proliferative and hypertrophic zones. In PTHrP-depleted epiphyses, a diminished [3 H]thymidine-labeling index was observed in the resting and proliferative zones accounting for reduced numbers of epiphyseal chondrocytes and for a thinner epiphyseal plate. In the mutant hypertrophic zone, enlarged chondrocytes were interspersed with clusters of cells that did not hypertrophy, but resembled resting or proliferative chondrocytes. Although the overall content of type II collagen in the epiphyseal plate was diminished, the lacunae of these non-hypertrophic chondrocytes did react for type II collagen. Moreover, cell membrane-associated chondroitin sulfate immunoreactivity was evident on these cells. Despite the presence of alkaline phosphatase activity on these nonhypertrophic chondrocytes, the adjacent cartilage matrix did not calcify and their persistence accounted for distorted chondrocyte columns and sporadic distribution of calcified cartilage. Consequently, in the metaphysis, bone deposited on the irregular and sparse scaffold of calcified cartilage and resulted in mixed spicules that did not parallel the longitudinal axis of the tibia and were, therefore, inappropriate for bone elongation. Thus, PTHrP appears to modulate both the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and its absence alters the temporal and spatial sequence of epiphyseal cartilage development and of subsequent endochondral bone formation necessary for normal elongation of long bones...|$|R

In all cases the femoral and tibial procedures were done at the same operative session. Femoral osteotomy was performed first. Intraoperative assessment of correction was made {{with the use of}} guide pins inserted proximal and distal to the osteotomy and perpendicular to the bone. The distal part of femur was then externally rotated according to a predetermined degree to achieve approximately equal medial and lateral femoral rotation. After this first step the patella appeared less internally deviated but the foot was more externally rotated. Tibial osteotomy was then performed. Internal derotation of the distal part of the tibia was performed by adding up degrees of performed externally rotated femoral osteotomy to degrees pre-operatively calculated, to achieve an internal rotating tibial correction. The goal should be to achieve a thigh–foot angle of < 20 ° [2, 5]. For femoral deformity a proximal metaphysis osteotomy was performed in one patient and a distal metaphysis osteotomy was performed in two. For tibial deformity a proximal <b>metaphysis</b> <b>tibial</b> osteotomy was performed in all cases. In the case of proximal femoral osteotomy, a lateral approach to the trochanteric region was used to reduce the chance of medial circumflex artery lesion. The osteotomy was done at the lesser trochanter level. A 90 ° blade plate is applied after the appropriate derotation. In the case of distal femoral osteotomy, a lateral approach to the distal femoral metaphysis was performed. A 6 - to 8 -hole plate is applied after derotation. The tibial osteotomy was done 3  cm below the growth plate, at tibial tubercle level. Staples were used for stabilization in all cases. No additional soft-tissue procedures were performed directly to affect patellar tracking. Partial weight bearing was started after 4  weeks; full weight bearing usually was started after 6  weeks.|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis causes over 2 million {{skeletal}} fractures {{every year}} in people 50 {{years of age or}} older. Fractures predominantly happen at corticocancellous sites, such as the hip and spine. Due to lower accrual of bone mass during growth and rapid bone loss following menopause, 71 % of these fractures occur in women. Mechanical loading, which stimulates bone formation, is a potential anabolic therapy for pathological bone loss. Determining the parameters of mechanical loading that stimulate osteogenesis in cancellous bone is critical for harnessing the therapeutic potential of mechanical stimuli. In this thesis, the effects of sex, aging, and estrogen deficiency on the adaptive response of cancellous bone were examined using in vivo tibial compression applied to mice. The effect of sex on the cancellous adaptive response to tibial loading was investigated in growing mice. The magnitude of peak applied loads that corresponded to + 1200 [mu][epsilon]at the tibial mid-shaft was determined to be - 11. 5 N in both males and females from in vivo strain gauging. This peak load resulted in similar peak cancellous tissue strains of ~- 2400 [mu][epsilon]in females and ~- 2100 [mu][epsilon]. Following 2 weeks of tibial compression, male and female mice increased cancellous bone mass 73 % in the proximal tibia, primarily through increased trabecular thickening (+ 75 %). Tissue mineral density increased 18 % and trabecular separation decreased 19 % as well. As a result of adaptation, the proportion of the applied load carried by the cancellous compartment, rather than by the cortical shell, increased. In addition, the metaphyseal stiffness of the loaded limbs was greater than in control limbs. None of these loadinginduced changes differed by sex. Next, the effect of aging on the cancellous adaptive response was investigated in adult, osteopenic female mice, and this response was compared to that observed previously in growing mice. We applied the same peak compressive loads (- 11. 3 N) to one group of adult female mice (Load-Matched), which corresponded to + 2200 [mu][epsilon]mid-diaphyseal strains and peak cancellous tissue strains of - 2257 [mu][epsilon]. We applied the same peak mid-diaphyseal strains (+ 1200 [mu][epsilon]) to a second group of adult female mice (Strain-Matched), engendered by - 5. 9 N peak applied load, which corresponded to peak cancellous tissue strains of - 1112 [mu][epsilon]. In the LM group, cancellous bone mass increased 49 % through increased trabecular thickening (+ 64 %), and cortical mass increased 41 % through medullary contraction (- 19 %). These adaptive changes increased the metaphyseal stiffness of loaded limbs relative to control limbs (IMAX + 88 %, IMIN + 54 %). No adaptive response was observed in the SM group. The response in the cancellous compartment was reduced relative to that observed in growing mice. However, tibial loading recovered age-related loss to levels equivalent to control limbs of young animals, supporting the use of mechanical loading as a therapeutic intervention against osteoporotic fractures. In contrast, the response in the cortical compartment was enhanced relative to that in young mice. While both young and adult mice similarly increased IMAX and cortical area, adult mice underwent enhanced medullary contraction. Finally, tibial compression was applied to osteopenic, estrogen-deficient adult female mice to demonstrate that mechanical loading can stimulate cancellous bone formation following estrogen withdrawal. Loading was applied immediately following ovariectomy (OVX) or sham (Sham) surgery and lasted 1, 2, and 6 weeks to characterize the adaptive response over time. Estrogen deficiency did not inhibit the adaptive response of cancellous bone in adult females. After 6 weeks of loading, cancellous bone mass increased similarly in Sham and OVX groups. Cancellous bone mass exhibited a bimodal change with loading due to the different effects of loading and estrogen deficiency, acting at different rates, on cancellous architecture. Loading primarily increased trabecular thickness while estrogen deficiency primarily increased separation. No differences in the control limbs between Sham and OVX groups were observed within the 6 week time period. In summary, tibial compression elicited a robust anabolic response in cancellous bone, which increased mass in growing young male and female mice, and in osteopenic and estrogen deficient adult female mice. Cancellous mass occurred primarily through trabecular thickening and resulted in an overall stiffer tibia <b>metaphysis.</b> <b>Tibial</b> compression recovered age-related bone loss in osteopenic adult female mice to levels equivalent to the control limbs of young mice, even following estrogen withdrawal. These results demonstrate that mechanical loading can be targeted to corticocancellous sites to increase bone mass, improve structural integrity, and reduce risk for fracture. Additionally, these results demonstrate that mechanical loading can be implemented as a preventative measure, either in growing children, or pre- and peri-menopausal women, to increase peak bone mass and reduce risk of fracture...|$|R

The 4 month postovariectomized rats possessed an osteopenic proximal <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis</b> with 7 % trabecular area compared with controls (19 %). PGE 2 treatment elevated osteocalcin levels and augmented proximal tibial metaphyseal bone area in ovariectomized and sham-operated rats.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare in vivo the efficacy of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and radiographic densitometry for the measurement of BMD after systemic administration of sodium alen-dronate. Wistar rats were randomly allocated to a control group (n  =  5), which received distilled water, and a sodium alendronate group (n  =  8), which received two doses of chemically pure sodium alendronate (1  mg/ kg) per week. After 8 weeks, the animals were euthanized, the tibias were removed, and the BMD of the proximal <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis</b> was ana-lyzed radiographically and by DXA. The data were subjected to statisti-cal analysis by the Kruskal-Wallis test at a significance level of 5 %. Both of the techniques revealed that the alendronate-treated group had a sig-nificantly higher BMD (p <  0. 05) than the control group after 8 weeks of treatment. Comparing the groups with and without alendronate therapy revealed increases of 14. 9 % and 29. 6 % in BMD, as detected radiographi-cally and by DXA, respectively. In conclusion, both of the methods were able to detect an increase in BMD of the proximal <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis</b> after alendronate therapy.

40|$|The {{objects of}} this study were to {{determine}} the responses of a cancellous bone site with a closed growth plate (the distal <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis,</b> DTM) to ovariectomy (OVX) and OVX plus a prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) treatment, and compare the site's response to previous findings reported for another site (the proximal <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis,</b> PTM). Thirty-five 3 -month old female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: basal, sham-OVX, and OVX+ 0, + 1, or + 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d injected subcutaneously for 3 months and given double fluorescent labels before sacrifice. Cancellous bone histomorphometric analyses were performed on 20 -micron-thick undecalcified DTM sections. Similar to the PTM, the DTM showed age-related decreases in bone formation and increases in bone resorption, but it differed in that at 3 months post-OVX; there was neither bone loss nor changes in formation endpoints. Giving 1 mg PGE 2 /kg/d to OVX rats prevented most age-related changes and maintained the bone formation histomorphometry near basal levels. Treating OVX rats with 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d prevented age-related bone changes, added extra bone, and improved microanatomical structure by stimulating bone formation without altering bone resorption. Furthermore, after PGE 2 administration, the DTM, a cancellous bone site with a closed growth plate, inereased bone formation more than did the cancellous bone in the PTM...|$|E
40|$|While alpine skiing, a {{professional}} skater fell. He was examined {{at the nearest}} hospital and diagnosis was distal crural fracture with multifragmentary <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis.</b> The patient left the hospital with only temporary immobilization after the suggested treatment for his injury was crural amputation. Thirteen hours after injury he arrived at his home hospital. He was immediately operated on to perform osteosynthesis on his left lower leg. The healing of the damaged soft tissue {{as well as the}} bones was excellent even though Sudeck’s syndrome appeared. Six month after injury he returned to skating and 1 year after injury he had completely returned to his everyday athletic routine without any complications...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the differences in}} the effects of continual prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) treatment in aged (non-growing) and young (growing) cancellous bone sites in 7 month-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The sites involved are the aged Distal <b>Tibial</b> <b>Metaphysis</b> (DTM) with a closed epiphysis and the young Proximal <b>Tibial</b> <b>Metaphysis</b> (PTM) with a slow growing, open epiphysis. The study involved rats treated with 0, 1, 3 or 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d for 60, 120 and 180 days. Static and dynamic histomorphometty of percent trabecular area, and tissue-referent bone formation rate (BFR/TV) were determined in both DTM and PTM. In pretreatment controls, the secondary spongiosa of the two metaphyses contain the same amount of cancellous bone (11 % in DTM vs. 13 % in PTM), but markedly less bone formation in DTM (0. 6 %/y in DTM vs. 41. 5 %/y in PTM). After 60 days of 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d treatment, %Tb. Ar was increased 607 % in DTM and 199 % in PTM, BFR/TV was increased to nearly 14 fold in DTM and only 5 fold in PTM. These results indicated the aged metaphysis of the DTM was much more responsive to PGE 2 treatment than young, growing metaphysis of the PTM. The results of 120 and 180 days treatment did not significantly differ from 60 days treatment in both sites, indicating that the effect of continuous daily PGE 2 treatment were in equilibrium after 60 days. We concluded that aged metaphysis was much more responsive to PGE 2 treatment than young growing metaphysis...|$|E
40|$|We {{characterized}} appendicular and axial {{bones in}} rats with type- 2 diabetes in five female Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a strain {{developed from the}} Wistar rat showing spontaneous type- 2 diabetes, and five age- and sex-matched non-diabetic Wistar rats. The humerus, tibia, metatarsals and vertebral bodies were analysed by peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT). In diabetic rats, {{the height of the}} vertebral bodies and length of the humerus were decreased while the length of the metatarsals was increased. A decreased cross-sectional area was found in the vertebral end-plate region and the <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis.</b> Notably, the diaphysis in all long bones showed expansion of periosteal and endosteal circumference. In tibia this resulted in increased cortical thickness, whereas in hu...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{exercise}} during growth affects composition, {{structure and}} mechanical properties of bone. In {{this study we}} investigated whether the beneficial effects of exercise during the early growth phase have long-lasting effects or not. Female Syrian golden hamsters (total n= 152) were used in this study. Half of the hamsters had access to running wheels during their rapid growth phase (from 1 to 3 months of age). The hamsters were sacrificed at the ages of 1, 3, 12, and 15 months. The diaphysis of the mineralized humerus was analyzed with microCT and subjected to three-point-bending mechanical testing. The trabecular bone in the <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis</b> was also analyzed with microCT. The collagen matrix of the humerus bone was studied by tensile testing after decalcification. The weight of the hamsters {{as well as the}} length of the bone and the volumetric bone mineral density (BMDvol) of the humerus was higher in the running group at the early age (3 months). Moreover, the mineralized bone showed improved mechanical properties in humerus and had greater trabecular thickness in the subchondral bone of tibia in the runners. However, by the age of 12 and 15 months, these differences were equalized with the sedentary group. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of decalcified humerus were higher in the runners at early stage, indicating a stronger collagen network. In <b>tibial</b> <b>metaphysis,</b> trabecular thickness was significantly higher for the runners in the old age groups (12 and 15 months). Our study demonstrates that physical exercise during growth improves either directly or indirectly through weight gain bone properties of the hamsters. However, the beneficial effects were for the most part not maintained during aging...|$|E
