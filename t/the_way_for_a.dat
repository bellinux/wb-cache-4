5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces {{would be forced}} into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where {{the bulk of the}} Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin.|$|E

Algeciras was taken with relative ease by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1344. Gibraltar, however, would not fall as easily. The Castilans subjected it to a fifth siege between 1349–50. It ended when Alfonso XI died from bubonic plague during the Black Death.|$|E

5|$|Akroinon {{was a major}} {{success for}} the Byzantines, {{as it was the}} first {{large-scale}} victory they had scored in a pitched battle against the Arabs. Seeing it as evidence of God's renewed favour, the victory also served to strengthen Leo's belief in the policy of iconoclasm that he had adopted some years before. In the immediate aftermath, this success opened up <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more aggressive stance by the Byzantines, who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene. In 742 and 743, the Umayyads were able to exploit a civil war between Constantine V and Artabasdos and raid into Anatolia with relative impunity, but the Arab sources do not report any major achievements.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E

Cotto entered the fight as The Ring magazine's #1 ranked boxer in the welterweight division and #6 in their pound-for-pound rankings.

5|$|Flight of the Hippogriff is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} for families, located adjacent to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. The ride opened in 2000 as the Flying Unicorn. Similar to the Dragon Challenge, this ride was re-themed {{prior to the}} opening of the Wizarding World. The roller coaster's back-story is that Hogwarts's Care of Magical Creatures professor, Hagrid, is teaching young wizards to fly on a hippogriff (as Harry does in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) by using a wicker replica of the creature. A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lesson from Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff.|$|E

Kuhn featured in a second-quarter scoring drive, completing a 10-yard pass to Scotty Neill inside the five-yard line and faking {{his way through the}} line for a touchdown. The Commodores won, 26–0; Kuhn was selected as an All-American by Billy Evans and received an honorable mention on Walter Camp's team. Kuhn and Centre's Flash Covington were the two quarterbacks from Evans' All-Southern team to receive Camp's mention. At the December 5, 1922 Vanderbilt football banquet, he was elected Commodore captain for the following season.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also {{put an end to}} the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
5|$|New Ironsides {{completed}} her overhaul in late August 1864, {{now under the}} command of Commodore William Radford, but did not join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in Hampton Roads until October when her crew finished gunnery training. She participated in a major assault in December on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in an effort to stop blockade running into the port of Wilmington. Though this attack was called off on Christmas Day after an extensive bombardment, the Union fleet returned to resume the operation on 13 January 1865. New Ironsides was one of several warships that heavily shelled Fort Fisher, preparing <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ground assault that captured the position on 15 January. Afterward and for the next few months, New Ironsides supported Union activities on the James River. She was decommissioned on 6 April 1865 and was laid up at League Island, Philadelphia, where, on the night of 16 December 1865, New Ironsides was destroyed by a fire. The ship was towed to shallow water where she burned and sank. Her wreck was salvaged and her boilers were offered for sale in 1869.|$|E
