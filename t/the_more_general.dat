5|$|An {{alternative}} phylogenetic {{hypothesis that}} has gained substantial traction places Brancasaurus in the clade Leptocleididae, {{along with other}} leptocleidids including Leptocleidus itself, Vectocleidus, Umoonasaurus, Nichollssaura, and also possibly Hastanectes. This result has been recovered by the phylogenies of Benson et al., who have also noted a number of morphological traits which ally Brancasaurus with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> Leptocleidia.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the First Amendment: The Politics of Free Speech and Pluralism is a {{book about}} {{freedom of speech and}} the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, written by author Samuel Peter Nelson.

In it, Nelson discusses how <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> notion of free speech differs from that specifically applied to the First Amendment in American law.|$|E

5|$|From Boston, Edwards {{moved to}} New York {{to stay for}} some ten years, {{performing}} on stage and participating in insect studies. He {{was active in the}} Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae. Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia. Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> Entomologia Americana, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.|$|E

5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|In Elizabethan England, music {{printing}} was {{regulated by}} two royal patents {{issued by the}} queen: one for metrical psalters (psalms set to music) and one for all other types of music and music paper. The patent-holders thus held a monopoly—only they or their assignees could legally print music. After printer John Day's death in 1584, the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees, {{who were members of}} the Stationers' Company. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575. Despite the monopoly, Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavours; their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur failed to sell and was a financial disaster. After Tallis died in 1585, Byrd continued holding the patent, producing works with his assignee, Thomas East. The monopoly expired in 1596, prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley {{to take advantage of the}} resulting power vacuum.|$|E
