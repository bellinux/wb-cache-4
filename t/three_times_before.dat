5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris Sabin. Joe {{performed}} his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then placed Sabin in his signature submission hold the Coquina Clutch. Instead of submitting, Sabin instead passed out in storyline, with the referee lifting and raising his arm <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> giving the victory to Joe at 14 minutes and 2 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} plates {{were included in}} The Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> they reached Bombay safely.|$|E

5|$|Van Buren {{retired as}} the NFL record holder for career rushing yards and career rushing touchdowns. He {{was the first}} player to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season twice, and he held the top two single-season records in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. He was the first to rush for over ten touchdowns in a season, a feat he {{accomplished}} <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> any other player did so once.

5|$|A {{featured}} preliminary {{match on}} Turning Point's card {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship, in which the champion, Petey Williams, defended the championship against Chris Sabin. The match was promoted for Turning Point on the November 12 episode of Impact!. In the weeks leading to the encounter, Sabin stated {{he had found a}} counter to Williams' finishing maneuver the Canadian Destroyer, which was thought to be uncounterable. The Canadian Destroyer involves Williams grabbing an opponent with his legs around their head, jumping over their back, causing them to perform a backflip, and forcing their head into the mat after they make the full rotation. Making true to his word, Sabin countered the move <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> Turning Point; one on the November 12, one of the November 19, and the last on the November 30 episodes of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E
5|$|As a {{marriage}} gift, the Tsar gave George {{a group of}} islands in the Petalioi Gulf, which the family visited on the royal yacht Amphitrite. George later purchased a country estate, Tatoi, north of Athens, and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos. George developed Tatoi, building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes {{and served as a}} bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at Piraeus two or <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> they weighed anchor. When alone with his wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.|$|E

5|$|Bangladesh's second innings {{started in}} similar fashion to their first; they lost the early wicket of Imrul Kayes, and Tamim scored a quick half-century. The latter was dropped <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> being caught by Broad for 52 runs. Junaid and Jahurul both made good starts for Bangladesh, but were out for 34 and 43 respectively, which along with low scores for Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur left Bangladesh on 172 for six {{at the end of}} the fourth day. On the final morning, Shakib batted {{resiliently}} with the lower-order batsmen and narrowly missed out on a century; he was the last man out, stumped attempting to score a boundary to reach the landmark. His batting had helped establish a 208 run lead for Bangladesh, which resulted in England requiring just under four runs per over to reach the total.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck, and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings, slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser. In the meantime, Morris, after a slow start, made 105 runs {{out of a total of}} 166 scored while he was at the wicket, including 14 fours and one six. His innings was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. His dismissal left Australia at 166/3, quickly followed by Miller, left Australia at 173/4. Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly, taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run. Hassett was dropped <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225/6. Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258/7.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield Wednesday on 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played only <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> the end of February when he submitted a transfer request. The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who just felt that different surroundings might help a return to form. He moved on to London club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E

5|$|East Germany was {{particularly}} {{successful in the}} 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping. Their women swept the award for the first ten years of its existence from 1980 to 1989, with Kristin Otto winning <b>three</b> <b>times,</b> <b>before</b> the Berlin Wall and communism fell. With {{the end of the}} state-sponsored doping program, the (East) German stranglehold on women's swimming was broken. In the two decades since reunification, the female award was won by Germans four times, three by Franziska van Almsick. During the 1980s, Michael Gross of West Germany, nicknamed The Albatross in reference to his vast wingspan, dominated European swimming, winning five consecutive awards from 1982 to 1986. Swimming World has vacated all awards previously awarded to East German swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic doping.|$|E
5|$|Morison {{was called}} up to the England C team, who {{represent}} England at non-league level, in November 2006, scoring in a European Challenge Trophy game against the Netherlands. Morison was then chosen to represent his country for the Four Nations Tournament hosted in Scotland in May 2007, where he played in victories against Republic of Ireland C and Scotland C respectively, assisting two goals in the process. He {{was included in the}} 16-man squad for the Four Nations Tournament hosted in Wales in May 2008, scoring in the side's 1–0 win against Scotland C, as well as featuring against both Gibraltar and Wales C. He was subsequently called up for the England C tour of the Caribbean in June 2008, in which Morison played both games against Grenada and Barbados respectively, scoring against the former in a 1–1 draw. Morison played a total of eight times for the England C side, scoring <b>three</b> <b>times,</b> <b>before</b> his age meant that he was ineligible to be selected.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after dark, around 7:00p.m., {{the first}} Ottoman counterattack {{came after a}} group from the 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to {{reinforce}} the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting {{took place in the}} complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could, often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Bradman retired and Barnes {{took a break}} from cricket, thereby opening two vacancies in the Test team. Brown had a reasonable domestic season in 1948–1949 to press his claim for a Test recall. He scored 626 runs at 41.73, the sixth highest aggregate of the season, with a century and three fifties. Queensland won two and lost three games. Despite this, the 37-year-old Brown was not named in the touring party for the Test tour of South Africa in 1949–50. In {{the absence of the}} Test players, Brown scored 507 runs at 50.70 in the Sheffield Shield season, with a top score of 190, making him the third highest run-getter. In their first five matches of the season, Queensland lost <b>three</b> <b>times,</b> <b>before</b> Brown's 190 in the last match against South Australia set up a nine-wicket win. It was his only century of the season after previously falling for 94 twices.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum potassium concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water {{at the end of the}} processing. Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E
5|$|Morris was {{out soon}} after for 105 runs with the score at 166/3, having struck 14 fours and one six. His innings, which was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives, ended {{when he hit}} Coxon to Hutton in the gully. Miller came in and Bedser bowled three {{consecutive}} outswingers to him. A fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller did not offer a shot, expecting the ball to curve away and miss the stumps. Instead, he was hit {{in front of the}} wickets and given out lbw for four. O'Reilly said Miller's display was more akin to that of a tail-end batsman with minimal skill, and blamed his poor form with the bat on an excessive workload imposed on him by Bradman. With two quick wickets, England had put the match back in the balance. Batting out of position in the middle-order, Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and a half minutes for each run. They realised Australia could not afford to lose any more wickets quickly and batted with extreme caution, reluctant even to attack long hops. Hassett was dropped <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> Yardley, who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a yorker. The English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia at 225/6. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace.|$|E
