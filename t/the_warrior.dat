5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> encountered the general, who was {{revealed to be}} the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> so he would reach the general, who planned to offer <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. <b>The</b> <b>warrior</b> refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> {{that if he were}} to kill the general, {{who was a member of}} his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken. <b>The</b> <b>warrior</b> declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.|$|E

Finding the general, he discovered that the general was actually his uncle and Circe's lover. After negotiations, <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> tricked his uncle into drinking poisonous Cerberus blood, killing his uncle. Circe was aghast and fled. Because he killed his uncle, it broke his oath to his father. The Giver appeared, revealing himself to be Orkos, and imprisoned <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> in the Prison of the Damned. In Ascension during Kratos' pursuit of Megaera, Kratos encountered <b>the</b> <b>warrior,</b> who was rejoiced to see an opportunity for freedom from his prison. Before being attacked by an arm of the Hecatonchires, <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> vanished in a beam of light upon praying to the gods. This transported him to the Rotunda of Olympus.

5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. <b>The</b> <b>Warrior</b> recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

Black Hawk raised a white flag in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation. The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the white flag to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> was injured.|$|E

5|$|The {{other main}} event was a WWF Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage.

While they faced each other at house shows over the next few months, where Savage was unable to win the title, they never had a televised match with each other.

To settle the rivalry, Savage and <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII. <b>The</b> <b>Warrior</b> won the match, forcing Savage into retirement. However, Savage would be reinstated as an active wrestler in November 1991.

Flair and his executive consultant Mr. Perfect, were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch. They decided to cause trouble between Savage and <b>the</b> <b>Warrior.</b> In August, Perfect claimed that he was in negotiations with Savage and Warrior, who both had sought his managerial services, but refused to clarify which wrestler he would support at SummerSlam. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, a show designed to promote the pay-per-view, Savage and <b>the</b> <b>Warrior</b> teamed up to face The Nasty Boys.
