The species has been {{variously}} known as Phalaris comutata, Phalaris bulbosa, <b>Toowoomba</b> <b>grass</b> and <b>Canary</b> <b>grass.</b> It has been grown in New Zealand mainly as a constituent of certain pasture mixtures but has not proved its value for certain reasons which will be indicated later. Mainly {{as a result of}} investigations at the Waite Research Institute, South Australia, this grass has given promise of being a valuable addition to the useful pasture species, and the result has been that it is being cultivated with considerable success {{in many parts of the}} Commonwealth. During the past two years it has been sown on a number of properties throughout Canterbury and numerous enquiries are being made concerning the agronomic features of the grass and its future possibilities. The plant itself is a tall, strong growing perennial with one or more swellings in the region of the lower stem internode. The blade of the leaf is very long, broad, flat and bluish-green in colour. The ligule is one of the longest in any of the grasses being almost as long as the leaf is wide. In habit, the plant, if not grazed, grows in clumps up to 3 ft. high producing a great bulk of herbage. The tall stems terminate in very closely comgressed panicles bearing a rather low yield of seed. Usually the yield of seed per plant is 2 - 3 % of the total weight compared with 20 - 30 % in the ryegrass. The seed is oval, flattened, moderate in size (300, 000 per lb. compared with 240, 000 per lb. in the case of Perennial Ryegrasses...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{boards are}} an {{important}} material for furniture production. In this sector, two tasks have had priority during recent years: to reduce {{the weight of the}} panels and to reduce the formaldehyde emission. As the production methods have been {{more or less the same}} for decades, these tasks have to be tackled by reducing or replacing the raw material in the board production. In this study, the possibility of replacing wood with reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> (Phalaris arundinacea L.) to obtain a light-weight particle board has been studied. The boards studied were three-layered with a core of wood/reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> particles and a surface of 100 % wood particles. A protein-based adhesive was tested as an alternative to a UMF adhesive to reduce the formaldehyde emission. Different combinations of densities between 250 and 450 kg/m 3 were included in the study and no additional treatments were made to the raw materials. The results showed poor mechanical and swelling properties of all the tested boards regardless of the design. The main explanation of the poor properties is the poor wetting of the reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> surface by the adhesives. A pre-treatment of the reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> particles with steam, lipase enzyme or alkali is suggested to increase the wettability.

40|$|As a {{supplier}} to the furniture industry, the particleboard industry {{is searching for}} opportunities to reduce costs, weight, and formaldehyde emissions. One such opportunity is to use monocotyledons such as straw and hemp, as well as <b>grasses</b> like reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> A major problem when using reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> or other monocotyledons in combination with wood is the difference in their surface properties, leading to poor reactivity and wettability with adhesives such as melamine urea formaldehyde. To this end, either {{the surface of the}} particles must be modified in some way, or different adhesives must be used. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present adhesives, surfactants, coupling agents, and pre-treatment methods that can be used in combination with monocotyledons to improve compatibility with wood. Some of the methods have been tested on reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> The results show a wide range of strength values for the joint between wood and untreated or pre-treated reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> glued with different adhesives, with and without a surfactant and a coupling agent. Isocyanate-based adhesives provided relatively strong bonds, and polyvinyl acetate, acryl, and epoxy adhesives were also effective.

40|$|Reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass,</b> Phalaris arundinacea L., is a {{relatively}} new biomass crop in northern Europe, which produces raw material for bioenergy and paper pulp. Breeding reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> for industrial purposes is under way in the absence of domestic cultivars being available. Knowledge of the extent of variation in biomass related traits is a basic requirement of the breeding programme. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe variation in biomass related traits and evaluate the relationships among the variables. Field experiment was carried out between 1994 and 1998 in Finland. Research material included wild and elite populations, which were divided into ten groups according to their origin. Biomass yield, plant fractions, shoot number, node number, leaf area and overwintering ability were measured. Panicle number, plant height and seed ripening were included to the analyses of the relationships. Results indicated the high biomass yield potential of reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass,</b> reaching over 13 t DM ha- 1 in the fourth year after establishment. Elite material and a local group from southern Finland had the highest biomass yield, whereas the northernmost local group had the lowest. Three factors established accounted for 45 % of the variance and they were defined as high biomass yield, leaf-shoot relationship and fast development. The first factor indicated positive connections among biomass yield, panicle number, plant height, straw fraction and node fraction. This study indicated variation in agronomic traits of reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass,</b> which enables breeding of new cultivars with desired trait combinations. ...|$|R
40|$|Within this thesis, a {{methodology}} for {{estimation of the}} potential supply of biomass feedstock from the energy crop reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> (Phalaris arundinacea L.) is summarized and discussed.

40|$|This study {{examined}} physiochemical conditions and prokaryotic community structure (the bacterial and archaeal 16 S rRNA genes and mcrA gene abundances and proportions), and evaluated {{the effect of}} reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> cultivation and mineral fertilisation on these factors, in the 60 cm thick residual peat layer of experimental plots located on an abandoned peat extraction area. The archaeal proportion was 0. 67 - 39. 56 % in the prokaryotic community and the methanogens proportion was 0. 01 - 1. 77 % in the archaeal community. When bacterial abundance was higher in the top 20 cm of peat, the archaea were more abundant in the 20 - 60 cm layer and methanogens in the 40 - 60 cm layer of the residual peat. The bacterial abundance was significantly increased, but archaeal abundance was not affected by cultivation. The fertiliser application had a slight effect on peat properties and on archaeal and methanogen abundances in the deeper layer of cultivated peat. The CH 4 emission {{was positively related to}} mcrA abundance in the 20 - 60 cm of the bare peat, while in case of reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> cultivation these two parameters were not correlated. Reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> cultivation mitigated CH 4 emission, although methanogen abundance remained approximately the same or even increased in different layers of residual peat under cultivated sites over time.

40|$|Douglas TallamyThe {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to study how restoration of a wetland affected the biodiversity of terrestrial arthropods. The wetland restoration site was originally filled with invasive reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> Terrestrial invertebrates at this site were compared to those in a meadow dominated by native plants, and a non-restored site dominated by reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> Each week during the summers of 2010 and 2011, samples were collected of terrestrial invertebrates in three sites by sweeping along fixed transects. Arthropods were identified to species units, counted, and weighed. The plants in each site were identified as well. A total of 38, 241 arthropods were sampled in this study. From April to early June 2010, the meadow and wetland restoration sites were similar with few significant differences in abundance, species richness, species diversity, or arthropod biomass. Following the herbicide and mowing treatments required to restore the wetland in early June, invertebrates declined in abundance, diversity and biomass in the wetland restoration site. In the following year, the wetland restoration site recovered {{in terms of both}} plant and arthropod diversity and abundance. From July 2011 onward, arthropods at the wetland restoration site generally showed an increase in terms of abundance, species richness, species diversity, and biomass to levels greater than the reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> site, and equal to or greater than the meadow site. I conclude that removal of reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> and reseeding with native plants leads to rapid recovery of arthropod herbivores, predator and parasitoids. Biological Science...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of the marsh with an emphasis on mammal populations. Attempts were made to study the dynamics on a biomass basis as they related to marsh habitats. Field work was conducted from February 1974 to January 1975. The 515 acres of the Myrick Marsh study area have a great complexity of marshland habitats including ponds, cattail marsh, and a great expansive area covered by reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> Gross environmental characteristics were determined for each of the six study units involved. Plant production in kilograms/hectare(kg/ha) was estimated by use of the clipping technique and it was concluded that Phalaris arundaceae (L.) and Typha latifolia (L.) constituted approximately 70 % of the marsh vegetation. By utilizing known methods the relative densities of insect populations which inhabited smartweed, cattail and reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> dominated areas were examined. It was found that the reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> supported the highest overall populations; with Diptera being the most abundant insect order. Invertebrate populations were compared for the litter, soil and standing vegetation between a smartweed and a reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> area. Mites and springtails were the most dominant organisms found in the litter and soil, while slugs and spiders were the most abundant in the standing vegetation.

40|$|Over-expression and {{transposon}} mutagenesis in root cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated {{the importance of}} the family 1 glycosyltransferase UGT 72 B 1 in catalysing the N-glucosylation of the persistent pollutant 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA). In phytotoxicity studies with DCA in seedlings, over-expression of UGT 72 B 1 enhanced sensitivity, whereas the knockouts were more resistant than the controls. In contrast, manipulating the expression of UGT 72 B 1 had no effect on the O-glucosylation, or toxicity, of chlorophenols. When N-glucosylation was disrupted in plants, radioactivity derived from [14 C]-DCA became covalently bound into high molecular weight insoluble material, principally associated with the lignin fraction. This suggested that insolubilization into stable cell wall components represented a more effective mechanism of DCA detoxification than the formation of N-glycosidic conjugates. A screen of plants used in remediation, identified low levels of N-glucosyltransferase activity in switchgrass and high activities in reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> When incubated with [14 C]-DCA, reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> plants accumulated soluble N-glycosides of DCA, whereas switchgrass formed insoluble residues.

40|$|Agricultural {{producers}} {{are interested in}} using biomass available on farms to substitute fossil fuels for heat production. However, energy crops like reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> contain high nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), potassium (K) and other ash-forming elements which lead to increased emissions of gases and particulate matter (PM) and ash-related operational problems (e. g., melting) during combustion. To address these problematic behaviors, reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> was blended with wood (50 wt%) and fuel additives (3 wt%) such as aluminum silicates (sewage sludge), calcium (limestone) and sulfur (lignosulfonate) based additives. When burned in a top-feed pellet boiler (29 kW), the four blends resulted in a 17 %– 29 % decrease of PM concentrations compared to pure reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> probably because of a reduction of K release to flue gas. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions varied according to fuel N and S contents. This explains the lower NOx and SO 2 levels obtained with wood based products and the higher SO 2 generation with the grass/lignosulfonate blend. The proportion of clinkers found in combustion ash was greatly lessened (27 %– 98 %) {{with the use of}} additives, except for lignosulfonate.
