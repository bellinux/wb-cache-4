Caversham Primary School, {{at the corner of}} South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate– the only surviving remnant of the earlier structure– is the suburb's war memorial.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we show, by Melnikov method, the {{existence}} of the transversal homoclinic orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem for all but some finite number of values of the mass ratio of the <b>two</b> <b>primaries.</b> This implies {{the existence of}} a family of oscillatory and capture motion. This also shows the non-existence of any real analytic integral in the circular restricted three-body problem besides the well-known Jacobi integral for all but possibly finite number of values of the mass ratio of the <b>two</b> <b>primaries.</b> This extends a classical theorem of Poincaré [10]. Because the resulting singularities in our equation are degenerate, a stable manifold theorem of McGehee [7] is used...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe article {{analyses}} {{the stability}} properties of minimum-control artificial equilibrium {{points in the}} planar circular restricted three-body problem. It is seen that when the masses of the <b>two</b> <b>primaries</b> are of different orders of magnitude, minimum-control equilibrium is obtained when the spacecraft is almost coorbiting with the second primary {{as long as their}} mutual distance is not too small. In addition, stability is found when the distance from the second primary exceeds a minimum value which is a simple function of the mass ratio of the <b>two</b> <b>primaries</b> and their separation. Lyapunov stability under non-resonant conditions is demonstrated using Arnold's theorem. Among the most promising applications of the concept we find solar-sail-stabilized observatories coorbiting with the Earth, Mars, and Venus...|$|R
