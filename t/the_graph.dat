5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Every finite graph has a book {{embedding}} onto a {{book with}} a large enough number of pages. For instance, it is always possible to embed each edge of <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> on its own separate page.|$|E
5|$|In graph theory, a book {{embedding}} is a {{generalization of}} planar embedding of a graph to embeddings into a book, {{a collection of}} half-planes all having the same line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> are required to lie on this boundary line, called the spine, and the edges are required to stay within a single half-plane. The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of <b>the</b> <b>graph.</b> Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> nor part of an edge or vertex of <b>the</b> <b>graph.</b> When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of <b>the</b> <b>graph,</b> an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E

5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E

These properties are close to being enough to characterize these graphs: <b>the</b> Grötzsch <b>graph</b> is an induced subgraph of <b>the</b> Clebsch <b>graph,</b> and every triangle-free four-chromatic -free graph is likewise an induced subgraph of <b>the</b> Clebsch <b>graph</b> that in turn contains <b>the</b> Grötzsch <b>graph</b> as an induced subgraph [...] <b>The</b> Chvátal <b>graph</b> is another small triangle-free 4-chromatic <b>graph.</b> However, unlike <b>the</b> Grötzsch <b>graph</b> and <b>the</b> Clebsch <b>graph,</b> <b>the</b> Chvátal <b>graph</b> has a six-vertex induced path.|$|R

5|$|In nonplanar surface embeddings {{the set of}} dual edges {{complementary}} to a {{spanning tree}} is not a dual spanning tree.
