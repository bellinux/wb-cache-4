40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{a study of}} inner-tank sloshing effect on motion responses of a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) system, through experimental analysis and numerical modeling. To investigate hydrodynamic characteristics of FLNG under the conditions of with and without LNG-tank sloshing, a series of numerical simulations were carried out using potential flow solver SESAM. To validate the numerical simulations, model tests on the FLNG system was conducted in both liquid and solid ballast conditions with 75 % <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> level in height. Good correlations were observed between the measured and predicted results, proving the feasibility of the numerical modeling technique. On the verified numerical model, Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) of the FLNG with 25 % and 50 % <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> levels were calculated in six degrees of freedom. The influence of tank sloshing with varying <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> levels on the RAOs has been presented and analyzed. The results showed that LNG-tank sloshing has a noticeable impact on the roll motion response of the FLNG and a moderate <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> level is less helpful in reducing the roll motion response...|$|R

50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture fuel vapors displaced while refueling, and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II vapor recovery system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the fill pipe seal in ORVR systems, prevents fuel vapors from entering the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>fill</b> pipe. That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any fuel vapors that come up that fill pipe, during the refuelling process. If the car's own vapor recovery system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of fuel vapors into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a pressure relief pipe.|$|E
5000|$|Schematic errors {{refer to}} the use of a schema to help {{reconstruct}} parts of an experience that cannot be remembered. This may include parts of the schema that did not actually take place, or aspects of a schema that are stereotypical of an event. [...] Schemas can be described as mental guidelines (scripts) for events that are encountered in daily life. [...] For example, when going to the gas station, there is a general pattern of how things will occur (i.e. turn car off, get out of car, open gas tank, punch the gas button, put nozzle into the <b>tank,</b> <b>fill</b> up the tank, put the nozzle back, close the tank, pay, turn car on, leave). Schemas make the world more predictable, allowing expectations to be formed of how things will enfold and to take note of things that happen out of context. [...] However, schemas also allow for memory errors, in that if certain aspects of a scene or event are missing from memory, people may incorrectly remember having actually seen or experienced them because they are usually a regular aspect of the schema. For example, an individual may not remember paying the waiter, but may believe they have done so, as this is a regular step in the script of going to a restaurant. Similarly, a person may recall seeing a fridge in a picture of a kitchen, even if one was not actually depicted due to existing schemas which suggest that kitchens almost always contain a fridge.|$|E

Project objectives are to develop materials or engineered systems that would significantly reduce the radionuclide transport to the groundwater from AX tanks containing residual waste. We pursued several studies that, if implemented, would help achieve these goals. They include: (1) <b>tank</b> <b>fill</b> design to reduce water inilltration and potential interaction with residual waste; (2) development of in-tank getter materials that would specifically sorb or sequester radionuclides; (3) evaluation of grout emplacement under and around the tanks to prevent waste leakage during waste retrieval or to minimize water infiltration beneath the tanks; (4) development of getters that will chemically fix specific radionuclides in soils under tanks; and (5) geochemical and hydrologic modeling of waste-water-soil-grout interactions. These studies differ in scope from the reducing grout <b>tank</b> <b>fill</b> employed at the Savannah River Site in that our strategy improves upon <b>tank</b> <b>fill</b> design by providing redundancy in the barriers to radionuclide migration and by modification the hydrogeochemistry external to the tanks...|$|E

This paper describes the work performed by the authors in simulating propellant slosh in a spherical tank using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

The results show that maximum slosh forces occur at a <b>tank</b> <b>fill</b> fraction of 0. 4 and 0. 6 due to the amount of mass participating in the slosh and the room available for sloshing to occur.

Cold calcination of low and high NOx low activity waste (LAW) SRS Tank 44 and Hanford AN- 107 simulants, respectively with metallic Al + Si powders was evaluated. It was found that a combination of Al and Si powders could be used as reducing agents to reduce the nitrate and nitrite content of both low and high NOx LAW to low enough levels to allow the LAW to be solidified directly by mixing it with metakaolin and allowing it to cure at 90 C. During room temperature reactions, NOx was reduced and nitrogen was emitted as N 2 or NH 3. This was an important finding because now one can pretreat LAW at ambient temperatures which provides a low-temperature alternative to thermal calcination. The significant advantage of using Al and Si metals for denitration/denitrition of the LAW {{is the fact that the}} supernate could potentially be treated in situ in the waste tanks themselves. <b>Tank</b> <b>fill</b> materials based upon a hydroceramic binder have been formulated from mixtures of metakaolinite, Class F fly ash and Class C flue gas desulphurization (FGD) ash mixed with various concentrations of NaOH solution.

40|$|To support {{development}} of a zero-gravity pressure control capability for liquid hydrogen (LH 2), a series of thermodynamic venting system (TVS) tests was conducted in 1996 and 1998 using the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB). These tests were performed with ambient heat leaks = 20 and 50 W for <b>tank</b> <b>fill</b> levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 %. TVS performance testing revealed that the spray bar was highly effective in providing tank pressure control within a 7 -kPa band (131 - 138 Wa), and complete destratification of the liquid and the ullage was achieved with all test conditions. Seven of the MHTB tests were correlated with the TVS performance analytical model. The tests were selected to encompass the range of <b>tank</b> <b>fill</b> levels, ambient heat leaks, operational modes, and ullage pressurants. The TVS model predicted ullage pressure and temperature and bulk liquid saturation pressure and temperature obtained from the TVS model were compared with the test data.

However, once the system entered the cyclic mixing/venting operational mode, the modeled and measured data were quite similar...|$|E
