5|$|Judith Quiney died by 9 February 1662, {{the day of}} her burial and a {{week after}} her 77th birthday. She outlived her last {{surviving}} child by 23years. She was buried in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church, but the exact location of her grave is unknown. Of her husband, the records show little of his later years. It has been speculated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> died in 1662 or 1663, when the parish burial records are incomplete, or <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> left Stratford-upon-Avon. He is known to have had a nephew, living in London, who by this time was holding the lease to The Cage.|$|E
5|$|Of Thomas Quiney's fate {{the records}} show little. It is speculated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> died in 1662 or 1663 when the parish burial records are incomplete. He {{certainly}} had a nephew in London, who {{by this time}} held the lease to The Cage.|$|E

5|$|Spence was {{scheduled}} to have a medical examination on 11 March and it was considered plausible <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> taken extra insulin to prepare himself for the examination.

5|$|Unlike Germanicus, Drusus {{was given}} a full funeral, and his body was interred in the Mausoleum of Augustus, {{alongside}} other deceased members of the imperial family. Like Germanicus, stories of poison abounded, with Sejanus as the murderer. Modern historians like Ronald Syme believe <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> simply died of illness.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
50|$|Sir John died on 8 June 1349, a date <b>that</b> {{suggests}} <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been {{a victim}} of the Black Death, although no documentary evidence appears to support that possibility.|$|R

5|$|Burnell was a {{dominant}} figure {{during the first}} part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward's return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been the most important royal administrator of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gutmann, citing Falun Gong {{allegations}} that Liaoning was {{the epicenter of}} organ harvesting from practitioners while Bo was governor, suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> used his involvement {{as a way of}} building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on organ harvesting, accused Bo of playing a role. Separately, Falun Gong practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1759, Washington married wealthy widow Martha Dandridge Custis, then 28 years old. Surviving letters suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{been in love}} at {{the time}} with Sally Fairfax, {{the wife of a}} friend. Nevertheless, George and Martha made a {{compatible}} marriage, because Martha was intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate.|$|E

5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} some as a sign of divine anger and punishment, and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{are in the}} Urnes style (Pr4), {{and they}} were commissioned by a former captain of the Varangian Guard named Ragnvaldr in memory of his mother {{as well as in}} his own honour. Very few could boast of returning home with the honour of having been the captain of the Varangian Guard. Moreover, the name Ragnvaldr shows that he belonged to the higher echelons of Old Norse society, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a relative of the ruling dynasty.|$|E

50|$|On 2 June 2017, Party was accussed {{of being}} financed by Alexander Usovskij from Belarus, after his emails were {{leaked to the}} public and German ZDF {{television}} reported about this. It is said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was supplying money from Russian Federation to Eastern European countries, including Slovakia, to fuel pro-Russian activities, even mentioning that Usovskij is supporting ĽSNS work. Usovskij denied to be in contact with ĽSNS, but said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sympathises with party activities, agreeing with their bid for a referendum to leave NATO. ZDF also added <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>had</b> been looking for investors for this referendum.|$|R

5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together with such force <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> fractured the skulls of {{one or both of}} the assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Beonna (also {{known as}} Beorna) was King of East Anglia from 749. He is notable {{for being the}} first East Anglian king whose coinage {{included}} both the ruler's name and his title. The end-date of Beonna's reign is not known, but may have been around 760. It is thought that he shared the kingdom with another ruler called Alberht and possibly with a third man, named Hun. Not all experts agree with these regnal dates, or {{the nature of his}} kingship: it has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> ruled alone (and free of Mercian domination) from around 758.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur {{from the town of}} Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that the gastraphetes {{was one of the}} many effective siege weapons used by Alexander the Great as he besieged Tyre. Aside from <b>that</b> event, <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> utilized the great composite crossbow in his other battles.|$|R
30|$|Evidence {{found at}} the scene of the blast also {{included}} a tooth, probably of the bomber, which featured an unspecified ‘distinguishing mark’ on its crown, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been from Lebanon, the report said (Al-Jazeera English report).|$|R
5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was a suspect in the murder of the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to have committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although {{it is impossible to}} ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} {{published the}} allegation that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned {{in some way that}} 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext {{in the hope that the}} police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
