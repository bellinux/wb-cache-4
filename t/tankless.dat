2500|$|This type of {{device is}} {{generally}} considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in {{the same way a}} dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces. Their poor efficiency is acceptable in water heaters, since most of the energy [...] "wasted" [...] on the pilot still represents a direct heat gain for the water tank. The Millivolt system also makes it unnecessary for a special electrical circuit to be run to the water heater or furnace; these systems are often completely self-sufficient and can run without any external electrical power supply. [...] For <b>tankless</b> [...] "on demand" [...] water heaters, pilot ignition is preferable because it is faster than hot-surface ignition and more reliable than spark ignition.|$|E

5000|$|Operation {{with low}} supply {{pressure}}: <b>Tankless</b> systems are reliant {{on the water}} pressure that is delivered to the property. In other words, if a <b>tankless</b> system is used to deliver water to a shower or water faucet, the pressure {{is the same as}} the pressure delivered to the property and cannot be increased, whereas in tanked systems the tanks can be positioned above the water outlets (in the loft/attic space for example) so the force of gravity can assist in delivering the water, and pumps can be added into the system to increase pressure. Power showers, for example, cannot be used with <b>tankless</b> systems because the <b>tankless</b> systems cannot deliver the hot water at a fast enough flow rate required by the pump.|$|E

50|$|Under current North American conditions, {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} configuration from an operating viewpoint often is to install a central (tank-type or <b>tankless)</b> water heater {{for most of the}} house, and to install a POU <b>tankless</b> water heater at any distant faucets or bathrooms. However, the most economic design may vary according to the relative electricity, gas and water prices in the locality, the layout of the building, and how much (and when) hot water is used. Only electric <b>tankless</b> water heaters were widely available for many years. and they are still used for low-initial-cost POU heaters, but natural gas and propane POU heaters have now become available for consideration.|$|E

5000|$|Heat source flexibility: <b>Tankless</b> heaters {{use either}} gas or {{electricity}} for heat. Their design may not conveniently allow other heat sources, including certain renewable energy options. One exception is solar water heating, {{which can be}} used in conjunction with <b>tankless</b> water heaters. Tank-type systems can use many heat sources such as district heating, central heating, geothermal heating, micro CHP and ground-coupled heat exchangers.|$|E
50|$|Point-of-use (POU) <b>tankless</b> {{water heaters}} are located {{immediately}} {{where the water}} is being used, so the water is almost instantly hot, which reduces water wastage. POU <b>tankless</b> heaters also can save more energy than centrally installed <b>tankless</b> water heaters, because no hot water is left in lengthy supply pipes after the flow is shut off. However, POU <b>tankless</b> water heaters are often installed in combination with a central water heater, since the former type have usually been limited to under 6 litres/minute (1.5 US gallons/minute), which is sufficient for only light usage. In many situations, the initial expense of buying and installing a separate POU heater for every kitchen, laundry room, bathroom, and sink can outweigh the money saved in water and energy bills. In the US, POU water heaters until recently were almost always electrical , and electricity is often substantially more expensive than natural gas or propane (when the latter fuels are available).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tankless</b> heaters may be {{installed}} throughout a household {{at more than}} one point-of-use (POU), far from a central water heater, or larger centralized models may still be used to provide all the hot water requirements for an entire house. The main advantages of <b>tankless</b> water heaters are a plentiful continuous flow of hot water (as compared to a limited flow of continuously heated hot water from conventional tank water heaters), and potential energy savings under some conditions. The main disadvantage is their much higher initial costs, a US study in Minnesota study reported a 20- to 40-year payback for the <b>tankless</b> water heaters. In a comparison to a less efficient natural gas fired hot water tank, on-demand natural gas will cost 30% more over its useful life.|$|E
5000|$|Temperature compensation: A {{temperature}} {{compensating valve}} tends {{to eliminate the}} issue where the temperature and pressure from <b>tankless</b> heaters decrease during continuous use. Most new generation <b>tankless</b> water heaters stabilize water pressure and temperature by a bypass valve and a mixing valve incorporated in the unit. Modern <b>tankless</b> are not inversely proportional, because they regulate {{the amount of water}} they heat and discharge, and therefore stabilize water temperature by using a flow control valve. Temperature change, not flow speed, is the issue the water heater must address. The wider the temperature rise, the less flow from the unit—the smaller the temperature rise, the greater the flow. The flow control valve, in conjunction with thermistors, maintains a stable temperature throughout the use of the unit.|$|E

5000|$|Recirculation systems: Since a <b>tankless</b> {{water heater}} is {{inactive}} when hot water {{is not being}} used, they are incompatible with passive (convection-based) hot water recirculation systems. They may be incompatible with active hot water recirculation systems and certainly use more energy to constantly heat water within the piping, defeating one of a <b>tankless</b> water heater's primary advantages. On-demand recirculating pumps are often used to minimize hot water wait times from <b>tankless</b> water heaters and save water being wasted down the drain. On-demand recirculating pumps are activated by push-button or other sensor. A water contacting temperature probe installed at the hot water usage point signals the pump to stop. Single-cycle pumping events only occur when hot water is needed thereby preventing the energy waste associated with constantly heating water within piping.|$|E

50|$|Power outage: In {{case of a}} power outage, {{electrical}} <b>tankless</b> heaters cannot supply hot water, unlike tank based heaters {{which can}} supply the hot water stored in the tank.|$|E
5000|$|Startup costs: Beyond the 2x-4x larger initial {{purchase}} price (as {{compared to a}} tanked water heater), installing a <b>tankless</b> system comes at an increased cost, particularly in retrofit applications. They tend to be particularly expensive {{in areas such as}} the US where they are not dominant, compared to the established tank design. If a storage water heater is replaced with a <b>tankless</b> one, the installer may have to increase the size of the electrical wiring or gas pipeline to handle the load, and replace the existing vent pipe—possibly adding expense to the retrofit. Many <b>tankless</b> units have fully modulating gas valves that range from as low as 10,000 to over 1,000,000 BTUs. Most electrical installations require AWG 10 or 8 wire, corresponding to 5.5 or 8.5 mm2 for typical POU (point of use) heaters at North American voltages. Larger whole-house electric units may require up to AWG 2 wire. In gas appliances, both pressure and volume requirements must be met for optimum operation.|$|E

5000|$|Achieving cooler temperatures: <b>Tankless</b> {{water heaters}} often have minimum flow {{requirements}} before the heater is activated, {{and this can}} result in a gap between the cold water temperature, and the coolest warm water temperature that can be achieved with a hot and cold water mix.|$|E
5000|$|Long term energy savings: Though a <b>tankless</b> {{water heater}} {{typically}} costs more initially, it usually costs less to operate because of lower energy use—since it only heats water when required instead of continuously maintaining {{a tank of}} heated water. Even homes or buildings with high demand for hot water may realize some level of savings. If instant hot water at taps at limited hours is a priority, a recirculation system can be accommodated by using an aquastat and timer to decrease the added heat loss from the recirculation system. If the storage tank of an electric heater is highly insulated, so that the outer surface of the tank is only slightly warmer than the ambient air, the savings with a <b>tankless</b> heater is less.|$|E
