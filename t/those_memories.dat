Although initially wanting to forget <b>those</b> <b>memories,</b> he penned the autobiography Qaddafi's Point Guard: The Incredible Story of a Professional Basketball Player Trapped in Libya's Civil War, which was published in 2013. Owumi wrote the book with Daniel Paisner, a New York Times bestselling author who had also written for Whoopi Goldberg and Denzel Washington. Qaddafi's Point Guard described Owumi's life from his childhood to his season in Egypt.

2500|$|Graeme Mitchison and Francis Crick [...] {{proposed}} in 1983 that {{by virtue of}} its inherent spontaneous activity, the function of REM sleep [...] "is to remove certain undesirable modes of interaction in networks of cells in the cerebral cortex", which process they characterize as [...] "unlearning". As a result, <b>those</b> <b>memories</b> which are relevant (whose underlying neuronal substrate is strong enough to withstand such spontaneous, chaotic activation) are further strengthened, whilst weaker, transient, [...] "noise" [...] memory traces disintegrate. Memory consolidation during paradoxical sleep is specifically correlated with the periods of rapid eye movement, which do not occur continuously. One explanation for this correlation is that the PGO electrical waves, which precede the eye movements, also influence memory. REM sleep could provide a unique opportunity for “unlearning” to occur in the basic neural networks involved in homeostasis, which are protected from this “synaptic downscaling” effect during deep sleep.|$|E

2500|$|Issues of self-deception {{arise when}} {{altering}} memories as well. Avoiding {{the pain and}} difficulty of dealing with a memory by taking a drug {{may not be an}} honest method of coping. Instead of dealing with the truth of the situation a new altered reality is created where the memory is dissociated from pain, or the memory is forgotten altogether. Another issue that arises is exposing patients to unnecessary risk. Traumatic experiences do not necessarily produce a long term traumatic memory, some individuals learn to cope and integrate their experience and it stops affecting their lives quite quickly. If drug treatments are administered when not needed, as when a person could learn to cope without drugs, they may be exposed to side effects and other risks without cause. [...] Loss of painful memories may actually end up causing more harm in some cases. Painful, frightening or even traumatic memories can serve to teach a person to avoid certain situations or experiences. By erasing <b>those</b> <b>memories</b> their adaptive function, to warn and protect individuals may be lost. Another possible result of this technology is a lack of tolerance. If the suffering induced by traumatic events were removable, people may become less sympathetic to that suffering, and put more social pressure on others to erase the memories.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{semantic}} memory {{was first introduced}} following a conference in 1972 between Endel Tulving, of the University of Toronto, and W. Donaldson {{on the role of}} organization in human memory. Tulving constructed a proposal to distinguish between episodic memory and what he termed {{semantic memory}}. He was mainly influenced by the ideas of Reiff and Scheers, who in 1959 made the distinction between two primary forms of memory. One form was entitled [...] "remembrances", the other [...] "memoria". The remembrance concept dealt with memories that contained experiences of an autobiographic index, whereas the memoria concept dealt with <b>those</b> <b>memories</b> that did not reference experiences having an autobiographic index. Semantic memory reflects our knowledge of the world around us, hence the term 'general knowledge' is often used. It holds generic information that is more than likely acquired across various contexts and is used across different situations. According to Madigan in his book titled Memory, semantic memory is the sum of all knowledge one has obtained—whether it be vocabulary, understanding of math, or all the facts one knows. In his book titled [...] "Episodic and Semantic Memory", Endel Tulving adopted the term [...] "semantic" [...] from linguists to refer to a system of memory for [...] "words and verbal symbols, their meanings and referents, the relations between them, and the rules, formulas, or algorithms for influencing them." [...] The use of semantic memory is quite different from that of episodic memory. Semantic memory refers to general facts and meanings one shares with others whereas episodic memory refers to unique and concrete personal experiences.|$|E

He {{was a kind of}} singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real." [...] In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, [...] "Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish". [...] In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, [...] "Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it." [...] In the wake of Jones's death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, [...] "His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: [...] one of the greatest instruments ever made." [...] Emmylou Harris wrote, [...] "...when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always," [...] a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole Me, several country music stars offer similar thoughts. Johnny Cash: [...] "When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'"; [...] Randy Travis: [...] "It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that"; Tom T. Hall: [...] "It was always Jones who got the message across just right"; and Roy Acuff: [...] "I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones". [...] In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, [...] "All I did was change the instrumentation around him. [...] I don't think he's changed at all." ...|$|E

Having left her universe moving at a high speed, she returns at the same speed, crashing through the windshield of her now stationary car, leaving her in an almost fatal condition. She ends up in a short coma and wakes up in an incoherent state and in shock. Olivia apparently loses her memories of her meeting with Bell and whatever information he may have told her. She regains part of <b>those</b> <b>memories</b> and learns more about the invasion between dimensions. Following the transition to an alternate reality, Olivia meets her doppelganger [...] "Fauxlivia", and ultimately shares a kiss with Peter Bishop. She is trapped in the alternate universe by Walternate, Walter's alternative self, while Fauxlivia replaces her in the prime universe. She is captured and drugged, brainwashed into believing that she is the alternate Olivia, complete with traits such as superb marksmanship skills which prime-universe Olivia did not possess. Olivia tries to escape her imprisonment and travel back to her own universe, but in doing so, she inadvertently goes to Fauxlivia's mother's house where she finally accepts the new memories as her own. It is revealed that the alternate Walter plans to use Olivia's Cortexiphan-derived abilities {{to find a way to}} safely cross universes, for which he needs her willing assistance. However, Olivia begins to regain her past memories after she has hallucinations of Peter Bishop, who comes to her in a vision and tells her that she doesn't belong there before kissing her. With the help of the alternate universe's Agent Broyles, she is able to escape from custody and make it to alternate Walter's Harvard lab, where she uses the tank to return to her own universe. Meanwhile, Peter realizes that he is with alternate Olivia, causing her to flee and return to her own universe as well. After returning to work, Olivia is dismayed to discover that Peter had become intimate with her doppelganger.|$|E

The two were neighbors for a while and had shared vocal duties in Temple of The Dog. Soundgarden manager Susan Silver {{recalled}} in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, that Cornell walked Vedder onstage at Pearl Jam (then named Mookie Blaylock)'s second show in Seattle, [...] "Alice in Chains filmed the show at Moore theatre in 1990 and that was the show this new band [...] opened for them. Everyone was still reeling from Andy ’s death... and they hadn’t really played out yet. The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage – he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world – in terms of people in Seattle – and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do – to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much to say, ‘This is your guy now’. Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready said about their friendship; [...] "Ed was from San Diego and he felt very intimidated in Seattle. Chris really welcomed him. Ed was super, super shy. Chris took him out for beers and told him stories. He was like, [...] "Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [...] and Stone [...] I give you my blessing." [...] From then on he was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do.". In a 2009 interview with Uncut magazine, Vedder stated that Cornell is [...] "the best singer that we've got on the planet". About the impact that Cornell had in his life, Vedder told a crowd in Alpine Valley before performing [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] with him in September 2011; “I had no idea how he would affect my life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [...] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound”. The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is also featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty.
