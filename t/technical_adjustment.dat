40|$|This paper investigates {{impacts of}} digital {{technologies}} on photographic post-production and image manipulation in information photography. An attempt {{is made to}} assess {{the extent to which}} ethical codes and conventions are being modified concerning the digital treatment of photographic images. We sought to assess whether one can identify, in the rules of photographic competitions, an embryonic process of establishment of new boundaries as to what constitutes content manipulation and what is acceptable as technical adjustments.  We observed that, in a large proportion of cases, competition rules consist of very generic guidelines regarding the acceptable procedures for photo editing, without clear distinctions between <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> and manipulation. Despite such limitations, we conclude that the analysis of photographic competitions can lead to identification of observable regularities that may act as ethical standards in relation to post-production images...|$|E

40|$|This paper broadly {{surveys the}} {{institutional}} framework comprising Swedish environmental protection during the 1970 s. Some preliminary conclusions are drawn concerning how this framework shaped the <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> process {{with respect to}} environmental concerns at the firm level. Based on {{a case study of}} a Swedish industrial firm, the paper highlights how the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) worked in practice and illuminates some critical problems related to the process of adjusting to the legal framework at the firm level. Institutional theory and the work of Nathan Rosenberg on technological development are used in order to study the influence of the legal framework on the efforts of the company to adjust to environmental demands. The paper suggests that the Swedish system of environmental protection – based on the individual testing system in a co-operative framework – might have promoted long-term innovative and effective technical solutions, because it was consent to decentralised experimental activity. However, before firm conclusions can be drawn, comparative studies within the Swedish system and, perhaps most fruitful, between various national systems of environmental protection are needed...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} a price setting monopolistic firm that has to decide on a price adjustment in light of some new information about the uncertain demand for its product. It is assumed that the firm applies the so-called minimax adjustment principle for this purpose. This optimality principle is based on the notion that human decision makers tend to be reluctant to change their behaviour and prefer to take the current price as a benchmark rather than to compute optimal new prices all the time. We show that the current price is maintained as long as it lies in some set that is derived from the firm's degree of uncertainty and its degree of conservatism as regards changing behaviour. Otherwise, the price is adjusted but kept {{as close as possible to}} the current price. Hence, the model provides an explanation for the existence of price rigidities which is not based on any <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> or menu costs but simply on how human decision makers may deal with uncertainty.

40|$|Recent {{statistics}} {{reveal that}} the number of online courses and degree programs offered by many institutions has significantly increased over the last few years. Despite this growth, factors affecting faculty adoption and satisfaction with online course development and delivery are not well known, in particular across different disciplines. Due to the growing demand for high quality online courses and degree programs, it is important for institutions to identify factors that are likely to contribute to and impede faculty satisfaction with online course development and delivery. The result of our data analysis suggests that the following are among the factors that contribute to faculty adoption of and satisfaction with online course development and delivery: higher number of online courses previously taught, higher rating of the majority of students' technical sophistication, higher quality of education that faculty believe online students receive, and improvement in traditional teaching ability through online teaching. On the other hand, among the factors that impede the adoption of and satisfaction with the online mode of instruction are {{the amount of time spent}} on grading and the time spent on <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Based on the findings of this study, the paper will suggest an adoption model...|$|E

The Commission supports private plans in the Medicare program; beneficiaries should be able to choose between the traditional FFS Medicare program and the alternative delivery systems that private plans can provide. Private plans have greater potential to innovate and to use care management techniques and, if paid appropriately, would have more incentive to do so.

40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) is an auditory prosthesis that can restore hearing in profoundly deaf or severely hearing impaired subjects, based on electrical {{stimulation of the}} auditory nerve {{by means of an}} electrode array implanted in the cochlea. With the advent of successful neonatal screening, an increasing number of infants, between 6 and 12 months of age, are implanted with a CI. Providing a CI at a young age is indeed observed to be crucial, e. g., for the development of speech and language skills. At the same time, such early implantation poses great challenges for the <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the CI processing. Prior to CI switch on, the stimulation levels for each stimulation channel have tobe mapped to the dynamic range of the individual CI recipient, and thisis again crucial for a proper remedial action. The usual mapping procedure (for adult CI recipients), however, relies on behavioral testing and participation of the CI recipient, which is impossible with infants. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the detection of electrically evoked auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) in electroencephalography (EEG) measurements holds great promise for the development of an objective CI mapping procedure, which would not require any participation of the CI recipient. The general goal of this project is to develop signal processing algorithms which are crucial for the realization of an efficient and clinically applicable automated objective CI mapping procedure. The focus is mainly on the suppression of electrical artifacts caused by the CI. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|From the introduction] Agreement {{was reached}} by the EU member states in June 2007 to remove the {{competition}} phrase contained in Article 3 (1) (g) of the EC Treaty 1 from the new Reform Treaty (hereafter {{referred to as the}} competition principle) and create a 'competition protocol' 2 that includes the words from Article 3 (1) (g). This paper argues such treatment of the matter is inadequate to protect the current competition acquis and ensure the healthy future development of Community competition law. Far from being a minor <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment,</b> this paper argues that the excision of the competition principle {{from the front of the}} Treaty is likely to have a number of damaging consequences for EC competition law. There is a real danger that in future EC competition law will be cribbed, crabbed and confined. While price-fixers may still be fined and dominant firms such as Microsoft put under the investigatory microscope, the power of the State to distort competition through subsidy and regulation will increase. There are also serious concerns as to the extent to which the excision of the competition principle will be deployed to assist industrial policy arguments in merger control cases and frustrate the liberalisation of hitherto protected industrial sectors. The paper is divided into four parts. Section 2 considers whether a protocol is sufficient to protect the current competition acquis; section 3 considers the likely consequences if Article 3 (1) (g) is not restored and the final section offers a conclusion...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated and feared {{concepts}} in the World today are risk which is the product of uncertainty. Risk and uncertainty are often used interchangeably by many economists as if they are the same thing, but it is not true. While risk can be measured and estimated, and even ensured, uncertainty can not. Uncertainty is the complete ignorance of the future and there is no amount of <b>technical</b> <b>adjustment</b> or mathematically finesse that can change our basic ignorance of the future. However, risk and uncertainty can not be separated because where there is uncertainty, there is risk. The probability of risk can be measured objectively, while that of the uncertainty can only be measured through the subjective probability depending on the marginal utility of money of an individual. For some individuals marginal utility of money will be increasing, for some others, it will be decreasing and yet for others it will be constant. Thus we have risk lovers or risk seekers with increasing marginal utility of money, followed by the risk averters with decreasing marginal utility of money and lastly the risk neutral with constant marginal utility of money. The investment decisions are based principally on the attributes of these three classes of decision makers because the higher the risk the higher is the returns and vice-versa. The paper also examines the causes of low investment in Nigeria by Nigerians as well as other nationals to include corruption and unfavourable macroeconomic environment in Nigeria. The paper is concluded with series of recommendations on how to curb corruption, enthrone good governance, transparency, accountability, Rule of Law and reducing risky environment existing in Nigeria so as to attract both local and foreign investors...|$|E
