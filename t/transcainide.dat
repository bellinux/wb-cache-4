40|$|<b>Transcainide</b> {{is a new}} {{lidocaine}} analog {{that has}} been shown to suppress a range of cardiac arrhythmias in an initial clinical trial. We have evaluated the effects of <b>transcainide</b> on sodium channel current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Reduction of sodium current by <b>transcainide</b> was concentration dependent, with an ED 50 of approximately 0. 5 microM (n = 9). This reduction of the sodium current exhibited little use dependence, and block did not accumulate even after 10 -Hz pulse trains. Moreover, little or no recovery from block was observed even when cells were hyperpolarized to - 160 mV for 1 min. We observed no reversal of sodium channel block after superfusing cells up to 1 h in drug-free solution. Thus, <b>transcainide,</b> unlike many other clinically useful antiarrhythmic agents, blocked sodium channels with very little time dependence or voltage dependence. These novel electrophysiological properties of <b>transcainide</b> may endow the agent with a unique spectrum of efficacy against certain arrhythmias. At the same time, the great potency of <b>transcainide</b> and its lack of reversibility, at least within an hour, mandate that the drug should be used with great caution. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Transcainide,</b> {{a complex}} {{derivative}} of lidocaine, blocks the open state of BTX-activated sodium channels from bovine heart and rat skeletal muscle in two distinct ways. When applied {{to either side}} of the membrane, <b>transcainide</b> caused discrete blocking events a few hundred milliseconds in duration (slow block), and a concomitant reduction in apparent single-channel amplitude, presumably because of rapid block beyond the temporal resolution of our recordings (fast block). We quantitatively analyzed block from the cytoplasmic side. Both modes of block occurred via binding of the drug to the open channel, approximately followed 1 : 1 stoichiometry, and were similar for both channel subtypes. For slow block, the blocking rate increased, and the unblocking rate decreased with depolarization, yielding an overall enhancement of block at positive potentials, and suggesting a blocking site at an apparent electrical distance about 45 % of the way from the cytoplasmic end of the channel (z delta approximately 0. 45). In contrast, the fast blocking mode was only slightly enhanced by depolarization (z delta approximately 0. 15). Phenomenologically, the bulky and complex <b>transcainide</b> molecule combines the almost voltage-insensitive blocking action of phenylhydrazine (Zamponi and French, 1994 a (companion paper)) with a slow open-channel blocking action that shows a voltage dependence typical of simpler amines. Only the slower blocking mode was sensitive to the removal of external sodium ions, suggesting that the two types of block occur at distinct sites. Dose-response relations were also consistent with independent binding of <b>transcainide</b> to two separate sites on the channel...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} {{efficacy of}} <b>transcainide</b> {{has been studied}} in 41 patients. It abolished ventricular arrhythmias in 10 out of 12 patients after i. v. administration and in 11 out of 14 after oral administration. It also reduced ventricular arrhythmias during recovery from exercise. The maximum intravenous dose prolonged the PR-interval by 43 % and QRS-duration by 37 %. Side-effects observed in 6 out of 41 patients included Mobitz Type I AV block, complete bundle branch block, hypotension and increased arrhythmia frequency. <b>Transcainide</b> is a promising new antiarrhythmic drug which should be used with caution in patients with conduction disorders and impaired cardiac function. Its value and safety in the chronic oral treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias remains to be established. status: publishe...|$|E
