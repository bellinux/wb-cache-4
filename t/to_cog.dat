50|$|An {{electronic}} gear-shifting {{system is}} a method of changing gears on a bicycle, which enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers and mechanical cables. The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur, switching the chain from cog <b>to</b> <b>cog.</b> An electronic system can switch gears faster, and because the system does not use Bowden cables and can calibrate itself, it may require less maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Torque ripple minimisation is {{achieved}} by an adaptive feedforward control method <b>to</b> reduce <b>cogging</b> torque and current measurement errors. Experiments have been conducted to show that torque ripples are highly sensitive to changes in current offset and cogging torque. An easy way <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>cogging</b> torque changes (due to temperature) is proposed and implemented after an initial estimation of the cogging torque is done. This initial estimation is necessary for manufacturing inaccuracies and ongoing adaptation is to cope with operating conditions changes. Higher harmonics of the cogging torque can also be compensated through this way. Current offset which contributes to {{a large proportion of}} the torque ripple is also compensated through an adaptive method. The advantages of the proposed scheme combine the benefits of preprogrammed waveform methods which are easy to implement and a simple adaptive system to effectively reduce RMS torque ripple factor from 11. 30 % to 1. 7 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- We {{show the}} {{dynamics}} computation employing Jacobian that relates {{the center of}} gravity (COG) to joints of link mechanisms, in this paper. COG Jacobian is used for the behavior planning and the control of humanoids. And, it usually expresses the relationship between the joints and COG of a robot's whole body. However, in this scheme, it’s calculated regarding each link and not the robot's whole-body. Moreover, we can obtain the torques by relationship between COG Jacobian and the applied forces <b>to</b> <b>COG</b> by using principle of virtual work. The loaded forces <b>to</b> <b>COG</b> can be obtained by employing Newton’s and Euler’s equations of motion. By the scheme, we can calculate the inverse dynamics regardless of open- and closed-link mechanisms. In addition, the forward dynamics can be calculated by employing COG Jacobian.

40|$|We have {{identified}} two new lysozyme-like protein families {{by using a}} combination of sequence similarity searches, domain architecture analysis, and structural predictions. First, the P 5 protein from bacterio-phage f 8, which belongs <b>to</b> <b>COG</b> 3926 and Pfam family DUF 847, is predicted to have a new lysozyme-like domain. This assignment is consistent with the lytic function of P 5 proteins observed in several related double-stranded RNA bacteriophages. Domain architecture analysis reveals two lysozyme-associated transmembrane modules (LATM 1 and LATM 2) in a few COG 3926 /DUF 847 members. LATM 2 is also present in two proteins containing a peptidoglycan binding domain (PGB) and an N-terminal region that corresponds <b>to</b> <b>COG</b> 5526 with uncharacterized function. Second, structure prediction and sequence analysis suggest that COG 5526 represents another new lysozyme-like family. Our analysis offers fold and active-site assignments for COG 3926 /DUF 847 and COG 5526. The predicted enzymatic activity is consistent with an experimental study on the zliS gene product from Zymomonas mobilis, suggesting that bacterial COG 3926 /DUF 847 members might be activators of macromolecular secretion...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{naturally}} occurring functional alleles of the recombination hotspot cog, {{which is located}} 3. 5 kb from the his- 3 locus of Neurospora crassa. The presence of the cog+ allele in a cross significantly increases recombination in the his- 3 region compared to a cross homozygous for the cog allele. Data obtained shortly after discovery of cog+ suggested that it was fully dominant <b>to</b> <b>cog.</b> However, a dominant cog+ conflicts with observations of hotspots in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which recombination is initiated independently of homolog interactions, and suggests recombination mechanisms may differ in Neurospora and yeast. We present evidence that cog alleles are codominant in effect on both allelic recombination in his- 3 and crossing over between loci flanking his- 3. In addition, we show that genetic background variation has at least a twofold effect on allelic recombination. We speculate that variation in genetic background, together with the complexities of recombination in crosses bearing close mutant alleles, accounts for the previous conclusion that cog+ is dominant <b>to</b> <b>cog...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{wind energy}} systems {{employing}} permanent magnet generator, {{there is an}} imperative need <b>to</b> reduce the <b>cogging</b> torque for smooth and reliable cut in operation. In a permanent magnet generator, cogging torque is produced due to interaction of the rotor magnets with slots and teeth of the stator.
