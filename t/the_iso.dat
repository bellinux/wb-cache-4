5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its bullion has <b>the</b> <b>ISO</b> currency code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ISO</b> 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A {{country is}} usually {{assigned}} new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries.

Codes for formerly used country names that were deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in ISO 3166-3.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ISOs</b> {{contended that}} Kodak had used its {{monopoly}} in the parts market to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, the service market. Kodak now asserted that its {{intellectual property rights}} provided a defense against the claim. The court held that rights under patents and copyrights are a rebuttably presumed legitimate business justification for refusing to deal with competitors. However, <b>the</b> <b>ISOs</b> rebutted <b>the</b> presumption.|$|R
5|$|Today, silver bullion has <b>the</b> <b>ISO</b> 4217 {{currency}} code XAG, {{one of only}} four precious metals to have one (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, the chronically high {{inflation}} was brought under control; this led to the launch of a new currency, the Turkish new lira (Yeni Türk Lirası) in 2005, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy. In 2009, after only four years in circulation, the Turkish new lira was renamed back to the Turkish lira with the introduction of new banknotes and coins (and the withdrawal of the Turkish new lira banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005), but <b>the</b> <b>ISO</b> 4217 code of the Turkish new lira (TRY) remains in use for the current Turkish lira in the foreign exchange market.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual authentication between {{the card and}} reader based on <b>the</b> <b>ISO</b> 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that {{the security of the}} Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E
