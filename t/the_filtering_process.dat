The CD horn requires an equalization boost of approximately [...] per octave with a filter knee centered between 2 and [...] (depending on horn design) in order to sound neutral and balanced. Most manufacturers of active electronic audio crossovers responded to this requirement by adding an optional CD EQ boost filter or high frequency shelf filter. For instance, such circuitry was provided via internal jumper links by BSS in their FDS-310 crossover and by Rane in their AC 22S and AC 23B crossovers. Rane allowed for greater front panel control of two bandpasses ("hi-mid" [...] and [...] "high") using CD horn equalization including sweepable frequency range on their AC 24 crossover. Further refinements of <b>the</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>process</b> are available in DSP-based crossovers.|$|E
