50|$|Market <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> gives {{companies}} a {{means to}} align themselves to the market at large and gives companies price thresholds to be working in. In highly competitive markets, market <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> becomes almost essential. Additionally, OEMs segregate their competitive parts from their captive ones and apply market <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> only on the competitive parts. There may also be instances where companies take a strategic decision to lose money on the competitive parts and cover up on their captive and critical parts. This is usually done to retain market share and customer share of mind.|$|R

50|$|Cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing,</b> however, {{suffers from}} some {{fundamental}} flaws. Firstly, costs are not fixed but fluctuate with raw material prices, purchased volumes, supplier contracts etc. Pure cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> thus causes fluctuating prices which {{can result in}} customer confusion, dissatisfaction and demand fluctuations. Although, service parts are less price elastic than their manufacturing counterparts, continued reliance on cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> can ultimately make customers sensitive to price fluctuations - if not to the actual prices then to the frequency of price changes. This can cause demand to start being affected by the frequent price changes, and can even push the company into a death spiral. Secondly, cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> does not take competition into account and may result in severe under or over pricing of service parts relative to the market. This may also result in under pricing of strong products and over pricing of weak ones.|$|R
