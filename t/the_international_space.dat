5|$|During the Shuttle-Mir programme, {{a series}} of American Space Shuttle {{missions}} visited Mir between 1995 and 1998 {{in preparation for the}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station. After the construction of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for future use and conduct some commercial research, being flown in later that year. This was to have been followed by more missions, including flights with space tourists, however due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Rosaviakosmos decided against funding the continued operation of Mir.|$|E

5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} planned shuttle mission after the Columbia {{accident}} to be launched into a low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station. Due to the inclination and other orbit parameters of Hubble, Atlantis would {{have been unable to}} use <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> Station as a safe haven in the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-Columbia requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by Endeavour in the event Atlantis became disabled during STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from stand-by status on Thursday, 21 May.|$|E
