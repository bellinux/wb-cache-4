5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found <b>that</b> <b>freedom,</b> but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{opposition}} to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while <b>that</b> <b>freedom</b> was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and {{all the members of}} the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.|$|E

5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said <b>that</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast too broad a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites {{in their attempts to}} censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the report concluded <b>that</b> <b>freedom</b> of expression was harmed by such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E
5|$|The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or {{freedom of the}} press. The author analyzes {{the impact of this}} clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed <b>that</b> <b>freedom</b> of the press would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E
50|$|The centuries-dominant {{philosophical}} {{traditions of}} determinism and freedom, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism, are examined. According to the first, determinism {{is consistent with}} our freedom and moral responsibility; according to the second, it is inconsistent with them. Honderich considers Compatibilism's argument <b>that</b> our <b>freedom</b> consists in voluntariness, doing what we desire and not being coerced; hence its conclusion <b>that</b> determinism and <b>freedom</b> can go together. He also examines Incompatibilism's argument <b>that</b> our <b>freedom</b> consists in origination or free will, our choosing without our choosing's being caused; hence the conclusion <b>that</b> determinism and <b>freedom</b> are inconsistent.|$|R

Marylanders like Representative John Crisfield resisted the President, arguing <b>that</b> <b>freedom</b> would be worse for the slaves than slavery, though such arguments became increasingly ineffective as the war progressed.|$|E
