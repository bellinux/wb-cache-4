Moreover, a fixed-ratio multi-coefficient GP is applied to efficiently generate mosaic of thinned areas with various thinning intensities. Although the captured carbon by a fixed-ratio multi-coefficient GP is lower, the thinned areas can provide various habitats for forest life with multiform contrasting edges. & Conclusion The use of a multi-coefficient GP allows prac-ticable planning of better thinning alternatives to increase carbon sequestration and forest structure...|$|E

40|$|In {{established}} Pinus radiata D. Don plantations {{growing on}} sandy soils in southern Australia, nitrogen uptake {{can be manipulated}} through thinning, management of residue, and fertiliser use. Thinning, {{in the absence of}} above-ground residue, results in a small increase in nitrogen uptake per hectare but can more than double nitrogen uptake per tree. This reflects the capacity of the thinned stand to take up all mineralised nitrogen. Thinning contrasts with clear-felling which results in substantially elevated soil mineral nitrogen concentrations and leaching. Uptake of nitrogen after thinning increases with the quantity of residue retained; all this nitrogen is taken up, there is no leaching. The release of nitrogen from residue is progressive and reflected in the pattern of nitrogen uptake. In contrast, fertiliser results in a rapid, large, but ephemeral increase in nitrogen uptake which is associated with elevated soil mineral nitrogen concentrations and high leaching losses. Patterns of nitrogen uptake after fertiliser application, and simple models of nitrogen leaching and uptake, indicate there is scope for improving the effectiveness of fertiliser use by varying the timing of application with respect to season and <b>thinning</b> <b>schedule.</b> There is probably little scope for influencing nitrogen uptake in established stands by varying the form of nitrogen fertiliser applied or through the use of nitrogen-fixing associations...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to describe the growth of individual Douglas-fir trees {{under a variety of}} stand conditions and management schedules. The model was developed using empirical data from open-grown trees and reducing growth capacities of height, stem, and crown as functions of intertree competition indices. Any initial pattern of spacing for up to 30 trees may be assumed. The user must supply the stem coordinates, estimate of site, and estimate of the number of years to reach a height of 4. 5 feet for each tree. Any intensity of <b>thinning</b> <b>schedule</b> may be requested up to an annual basis. The model simulates the form of the entire bole and crown for up to 80 years of growth. All calculations were performed on a CDC 3300 electronic computer. Individual tree and stand summaries can be listed for any periodic interval of interest:. A Cal-Comp plotter output is available for a complete stem analysis, output for one specified tree in the stand. All coefficients for regressions fitted in the model are listed in a separate file for easy access and modification. The {{mathematical model}} developed here satisfactorily describes the growth of Douglas-fir stands on an individual tree basis {{for a wide range of}} stand conditions and management schedules. It was tested against seven permanent field plots for a range of conditions in both Oregon and Washington. Although predictions were not accurate there are no gross errors and the results demonstrate the sensitivity and stability of the model. The model developed here can be a valuable tool to the forester in training students, analyzing basic growth relationships, testing management schedules, evaluating fertilization and irrigation responses, and planning allowable cuts, sustained yields, and economic returns of forest products...|$|E

To this end, novel adjective-noun word pairs were presented visually in three conditions: (1) Physical, easy to experience with the senses (e. g., printed schedule); (2) Abstract, difficult to experience with the senses (e. g., conditional schedule); and (3) novel Metaphorical, expressions with a physical adjective, but a figurative meaning (e. g., <b>thin</b> <b>schedule).</b> We replicated the N 400 lexical concreteness effect for concrete versus abstract adjectives. In order to increase the sensitivity of the concreteness manipulation on the expressions, we divided each condition into high and low groups according to rated concreteness. Mirroring the adjective result, we observed a N 400 concreteness effect at the noun for physical expressions with high concreteness ratings versus abstract expressions with low concreteness ratings, even though the nouns per se did not differ in lexical concreteness. Paradoxically, the N 400 to nouns in the metaphorical expressions was indistinguishable from that to nouns in the literal abstract expressions, but only for the more concrete subgroup of metaphors; the N 400 to the less concrete subgroup of metaphors patterned with that to nouns in the literal concrete expressions.

40|$|Functional {{communication}} training (FCT) is {{a widely}} used treatment for individuals with developmental disabilities who exhibit severe behavior problems. One inherent challenge of employing FCT as a treatment in the community is that reinforcement for appropriate communication cannot always be immediate or even possible in some circumstances.

In the current study, we compared FCT with extinction to FCT with extinction and access to competing stimuli.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} four {{methods for}} increasing the practicality of functional communication training (FCT) by decreasing the frequency of reinforcement for alternative behavior. Three participants whose problem behaviors were maintained by positive reinforcement were treated successfully with FCT in which reinforcement for alternative behavior was initially delivered on fixed-ratio (FR) 1 schedules. One participant was then exposed to increasing delays to reinforcement under FR 1, a graduated fixed-interval (FI) schedule, and a graduated multiple-schedule arrangement in which signaled periods of reinforcement and extinction were alternated. Results showed that (a) increasing delays resulted in extinction of the alternative behavior, (b) the FI schedule produced undesirably high rates of the alternative behavior, and (c) the multiple schedule resulted in moderate and stable levels of the alternative behavior as {{the duration of the}} extinction component was increased. The other 2 participants were exposed to graduated mixed-schedule (unsignaled alternation between reinforcement and extinction components) and multiple-schedule (signaled alternation between reinforcement and extinction components) arrangements in which the durations of the reinforcement and extinction components were modified. Results obtained for these 2 participants indicated that the use of discriminative stimuli in the multiple schedule facilitated reinforcement <b>schedule</b> <b>thinning.</b> Upon completion of treatment, problem behavior remained low (or at zero), whereas alternative behavior was maintained as well as differentiated during a multiple-schedule arrangement consisting of a 4 -min extinction period followed by a 1 -min reinforcement period...|$|R
