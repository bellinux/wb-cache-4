The AlGaAs photodiodes were shown to be suitable for photon counting X-ray spectroscopy at room temperature. When coupled to a custom-made low-noise charge-sensitive preamplifier, a mean energy resolution (as quantified by the full width at half maximum of the 5. 9 keV photopeak) of 1. 24 keV was measured at room temperature. Parameters such as the depletion width (1. 92 µm at 10 V), charge <b>trapping</b> <b>noise</b> (61. 7 e−rms ENC at 5 V, negligible at 10 V) and the electronic noise components (known dielectric noise (63. 4 e− rms), series white noise (27. 7 e−rms), parallel white noise (9. 5 e−rms) and 1 /f series noise (2. 2 e−rms) at 10 V reverse bias) affecting the achieved energy resolution were computed. The estimated charge <b>trapping</b> <b>noise</b> and mean energy resolution were compared to similar materials (e. g. Al 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As) previously reported, and discussed.

It has been designed in a 1. 4 mu m-pitch, a two-transistor (2 T) shared readout architecture and fabricated in a combined 65 nm and 90 nm technology. The vertically pinned photodiode takes up almost the entire volume of the pixel, allowing a full well capacity (FWC) exceeding 7000 h(+). With a conversion factor around 120 mu V/h(+), the output swing approaching 1 V is achieved on the column voltage. The pixel also integrates capacitive deep trench isolation (CDTI) to tackle electrical and optical crosstalk issues. The effective passivation of trench interface by CDTI bias control is demonstrated for a hole-based pixel. As expected, PMOS transistors have much lower <b>trapping</b> <b>noise</b> compared to NMOS counterparts.

40|$|An {{extended}} {{analysis is}} presented for the excess noise of GaAs-Schottky-Diodes in a mm-waveguide-mixer. A mixer simulation program includes {{the effects of}} nonlinear capacitances, arbitrary embedding impedances, non ideality of microwave diodes {{and all kinds of}} noise generated in the diode. The determination of the diode capacitance is established in an empirical way. With the measurement of both, the noise at 94 GHz and the conversion loss, it is possible to find a new characteristic of the capacitance versus voltage. This differs from the commonly used square root function. Based on measurements of the noise temperature for different currents in the frequency range of 100 MHz to 94 GHz a noise model of the diode is established and compared to conventional noise theory: In the frequency range below 2 GHz the noise temperature runs through a maximum with respect to diode current; with the frequency increased the maximum decreases and is shifted to higher currents. This effect can be modeled by a current dependent time constant in the <b>trapping</b> <b>noise</b> formula. Finally measurements at an original 94 GHz mixer were done to verify the theoretical results including the extensions mentioned above.

Dark current and capacitance measurements as a function of applied forward and reverse bias are presented. The results show low leakage current densities, in the range of nA/cm 2 at the maximum internal electric field (22 kV/cm). The unintentional doping concentration of the i layer, calculated from capacitance measurements, was found to be < 1014 cm− 3. Photocurrent measurements were performed under visible and near infrared light illumination for both diodes. The analysis of these measurements suggests the presence of a non-active (dead) layer (0. 16 μm thickness) at the p+ side top contact interface, where the photogenerated carriers do not contribute to the photocurrent, possibly due to recombination. One of the diodes, D 1, was also characterized as detector for room temperature photon counting X-ray spectroscopy; the best energy resolution achieved (FWHM) at 5. 9 keV was 745 eV. The noise analysis of the system, based on spectra obtained at different shaping times and applied reverse biases, showed that the dominant source of noise is the dielectric noise.

This paper {{presents the}} evaluation of sub-micrometer-size Pt/n-GaAs anode fabrication technology based on electrochemical metal deposition for planar Schottky-diodes. The technological approach for low-noise Pt/n-GaAs Schottky diode fabrication has been first optimised for whisker-contacted diodes and then successfully transferred to the fabrication of planar structures using a “dummy anodes ” structural approach. The IF-noise temperature of planar diodes is significantly {{lower than that of}} whisker-contacted diodes. Excess noise of whisker-contacted anodes is attributed to temperature effects which are reduced in the planar quasi-vertical design. The effect of thermal annealing on IF noise temperature of planar structures is investigated using a “single step ” method. In contrast to non-annealed samples, no evident threshold of the noise temperature is observed up to 3 mA of bias current for thermally annealed samples. This strongly suggests that RIE-induced defects in the GaAs surface may generate <b>trap</b> <b>noise</b> at a few GHz. However this can be effectively reduced by thermal annealing.

Maxwell's equations and noise theory form the basis of the analyses in which three independent methods are used to predict a spatial distribution which exhibits interference minima and maxima.

By a study of the <b>trapped</b> <b>noise</b> currents, it is found that the radiation pattern has an interference structure which is smoothed as the loss is increased. Secondly, a formula is derived for the radiation pattern of a heated wire by a computation of its absorption in an isothermal enclosure and by an application of the principle of detailed balancing.

40|$|Summary 1. The rapid {{increase}} {{of human activity}} in wild and developed areas presents novel challenges for wildlife. Some species may use human-dominated landscapes because of favourable resources (e. g. high prey availability along roadsides); however, use of these areas may increase exposure to anthropogenic stressors, such as human disturbance or noise, which can negatively affect reproduction or survival. In this case, human-dominated landscapes may act as an ecological trap. 2. We evaluated whether American kestrel Falco sparverius reproductive failure was associated with human disturbance (traffic conditions and land development) or other common predictors of reproductive outcome, such as habitat and clutch initiation date. Also, we examined relationships among human disturbance, corticosterone (CORT) concentrations and nest abandonment to explore potential mechanisms for stress-induced reproductive failure. 3. Twenty-six (36 %) of 73 kestrel nesting attempts failed and 88 % of failures occurred during incubation. Kestrels nesting in higher disturbance areas were 9. 9 {{times more likely to}} fail than kestrels nesting in lower disturbance areas. Habitat and clutch initiation date did not explain reproductive outcome. 4. Females in higher disturbance areas had higher CORT and were more likely to abandon nests than females in lower disturbance areas. There was no relationship between male CORT and disturbance or abandonment. Females spent more time incubating than males and may have had more exposure to anthropogenic stressors. Specifically, traffic noise may affect a cavity-nesting bird’s perception of the outside environment by masking auditory cues. In response, incubating birds may perceive a greater predation risk, increase vigilance behaviour, decrease parental care, or both. 5. Synthesis and applications. Proximity to large, busy roads and developed areas negatively affected kestrel reproduction by causing increased stress hormones that promoted nest abandonment. These results demonstrate that species presence in a human-dominated landscape does not necessarily indicate a tolerance for anthropogenic stressors. Managers should carefully consider or discourage projects that juxtapose favourable habitat conditions with areas of high human activity to decrease risk of ecological <b>traps.</b> <b>Noise</b> mitigation, while locally effective, may not protect widespread populations from the pervasive threat of traffic noise.

Therefore, it is the desire of most experimentalists to minimize and possibly eliminate noise from their optical trapping experiments. A step in this direction is to quantify the actual noise in the system and to evaluate how much each particular component contributes to the overall noise. For this purpose we present Allan variance analysis as a straightforward method. In particular, it allows for judging the impact of drift which gives rise to low-frequency noise, which is extremely difficult to pinpoint by other methods. We show how to determine the optimal sampling time for calibration, the optimal number of data points for a desired experiment, and we provide measurements of how much accuracy is gained by acquiring additional data points. Allan variances of both micrometer-sized spheres and asymmetric nanometer-sized rods are considered. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, presented at SPIE Optics+Photonics 2009 in San Diego, CA, US...|$|R
