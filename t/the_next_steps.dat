A plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary charge in Geneva for six months while Bucer and Calvin would visit the city to determine <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps.</b> The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in Geneva. By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to Geneva for six months. Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family.|$|E
5|$|The {{posters of}} Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year's Day {{a member of}} the public came forward to provide {{information}} about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police that the men were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff's mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps.</b> Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott-Bower, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present.|$|E

25|$|The {{accession}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO is in {{the negotiation}} phase, and a Membership Action Plan was signed in April 2010. It requires Bosnia and Herzegovina to define the issue of property over defence assets before NATO may consider <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps.</b> Bosnian political parties have different attitudes towards NATO: while Bosniak and Bosnian Croat parties support it, Bosnian Serb parties are more cautious and, while not opposing it in principle, require it {{to be put to}} a referendum first.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} subsequently {{stated that}} they would return to Juba and Kampala, as the LRA had broken the agreement, and that the ceasefire agreement would not be extended. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> of both sides are unclear.

25|$|Hampton's {{claim of}} victory was also credible. He had {{prevented}} Sheridan from learning {{the disposition of}} Lee's army while delaying the Union advance for seven hours. And General Lee received the valuable intelligence he had sought.

He fell unconscious from his horse with a broken right shoulder blade and two broken ribs and was evacuated to Richmond. G.W. Smith assumed temporary command of the army. Smith, plagued with ill health, was indecisive about <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> for the battle and made a bad impression on Confederate President Jefferson Davis and General Robert E.

25|$|The Battle of Haw's Shop {{lasted for}} over seven hours {{and was the}} bloodiest cavalry battle since Brandy Station in 1863. It was an unusual battle in {{comparison}} to previous cavalry engagements in the Eastern Theater because it was fought predominantly by dismounted cavalry, {{many of which were}} protected by earthworks. Both sides claimed victory. Sheridan bragged that his men had driven Hampton from the field and had again demonstrated their superiority over the Confederate cavalry. Hampton, however, had prevented Sheridan from learning the disposition of Lee's army while delaying the Union advance for seven hours, and General Lee received the valuable intelligence he had sought. He now knew that Grant had crossed the Pamunkey in force, although he was still unclear on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> that Grant might take and therefore waited for further developments.|$|E
25|$|Within a year, Virgin Group was {{considering}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> for the radio station, including {{the option of}} a flotation or buying back the shares of JP Morgan, Apax and Sir David Frost. In May 1997, {{it was announced that}} Capital Radio had agreed to acquire Virgin Radio in an £87million deal. Capital's plans included moving Virgin Radio from 1 Golden Square to Capital's Leicester Square building and splitting programming between the AM and FM services. The Radio Authority approved the acquisition, but Nigel Griffiths, the Consumer Affairs Minister, referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). The MMC report into the takeover would not be issued until January 1998, and would recommend that the deal could only go ahead if Capital Gold was sold or Virgin's London FM licence was left out of the deal. However, the delay in approval of the Capital acquisition would ultimately lead to the deal not going through.|$|E

25|$|By 5July, forward {{elements}} of Fourth Panzer Army {{had reached the}} Don River near Voronezh and became embroiled in the battle to capture the city. Stalin and the Soviet command still expected the main German thrust in the north against Moscow, and believed the Germans would turn north after Voronezh to threaten the capital. As a result, the Soviets rushed reinforcements into the town to hold it at all costs and counterattacked the Germans' northern flank {{in an effort to}} cut off the German spearheads. 5th Tank Army, commanded by Major General A.I. Liziukov, managed to achieve some minor successes when it began its attack on 6July, but was forced back to its starting positions by 15July, losing about half of its tanks in the process. Although the battle was a success, Hitler and von Bock, commander of Army Group South, argued over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> in the operation. The heated debate, and continuing Soviet counterattacks, which tied down Fourth Panzer Army until 13July, caused Hitler to lose his temper and dismiss von Bock. As part of {{the second phase of the}} operation, on 9July, Army Group South was split into Army Group A and Army Group B, with Wilhelm List appointed as commander of Army Group A in place of von Bock.|$|E
