30|$|Because <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is a water-{{miscible}} solvent and also miscible with CLA menthyl ester, {{the addition of}} <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> greatly changes {{the state of the}} reaction mixture which consists of two phases, i.e., aqueous and oil phases. When a small amount of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is added to the mixture, water and CLA menthyl ester are partitioned into the oil and aqueous phases, respectively. Meanwhile, the mixture will become one phase when more <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is added. Therefore, the initial ratios of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> CLA menthyl ester and water were changed, and effects of the ratio on the hydrolysis were discussed from the viewpoint {{of the state of the}} reaction mixture, the initial reaction rate, and the degree of hydrolysis.|$|E

30|$|The initial {{reaction}} {{rates in the}} two-phase system were much improved for all cases {{compared to that of}} the control (Figure 2). Especially when the ratio of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was 9 – 50 wt%, the reaction rates tended to greatly increase, and the maximum reaction rate reached ca. 10.8 times that of the control. These results would support the fact that the addition of a small amount of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> activates the lipase from C. rugosa, and that the formation of the interface between the two phases is very important for the lipase to sufficiently exhibit its catalytic activity even in the presence of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, metal perchlorates have been widely {{exploited}} as Lewis acid promoters in various organic transformations. A new mild method for protecting <b>alcohols</b> as <b>t-butyl</b> ethers is reported. The reaction proceeds with Mg(ClO 4) 2 and Boc 2 O and shows general applicability. The procedure provides a very good method for obtaining <b>t-butyl</b> ethers from <b>alcohols,</b> since it works under mildly acidic conditions and many functional groups survive the protection process. Moreover, all side products of the reaction are volatile compounds, so that the purification of the products is very simple and convenient. Typically, t-butyl ethers have to be separated only from the residual starting materials. Finally, a simple and mild method for deprotecting t-butyl ethers based on the CeCl 3. 7 H 2 O/NaI system gives very satisfactory preliminary results...|$|R

A {{was designed to}} accelerate metabolism for weight reduction. During assay development a significant loss of A was apparent from frozen urine quality control samples. The addition of 0. 75 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) in urine (v/v) was required to maximize the recovery of A from urine. Urine samples were basified and extracted into methyl <b>t-butyl</b> ether-isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> (90 : 10, v/v). The organic layer was washed, evaporated, reconstituted, and injected onto a 5 cm, CS HPLC column prior to MS-MS analysis. The standard curve was linear from 5 to 500 ng/ml. Intraday precision for peak area ratios from BSA urine samples at seven separate concentrations over a range of 5 - 500 ng/ml (n = 5) was < 4. 0 % and calculated concentrations were within 91 - 115 % of nominal concentrations. Interday precision for BSA urine quality control (QC) samples at four separate concentrations (n = 10 of each) was < 5. 0 % and individual calculated concentrations were within 90 - 111 % of nominal concentrations, This work emphasizes that potential metabolites and quality control standards should be prepared and assayed {{as early as possible}} in method development., especially before the sample collection section of the clinical protocol is prepared.

40|$|Oxidation is an {{important}} route for the activation of chemical feedstocks for the synthesis of chemical intermediates. Alkene epoxidation by the electrophilic addition of oxygen to a carbon-carbon double bond is a major challenge in oxidation catalysis. In particular {{it is important to}} use molecular oxygen as the oxidant to avoid the formation of reagent by-products. We report the oxidation with air using graphite-supported gold-palladium catalysts of two alkenes, cis-cyclooctene, which gives mainly the epoxide, and crotyl alcohol (trans-but- 2 -en- 1 -ol). With cyclooctene, the reaction requires catalytic amounts of t-butyl hydroperoxide. The Au-Pd ratio has a major effect on the conversion with very low activities being associated with Au:Pd ratios of ca. 4 : 1 and 1 : 4 by weight. The selectivity to the epoxide is not affected by the Au : Pd ratio. With crotyl <b>alcohol,</b> <b>t-butyl</b> hydroperoxide was not required for activity. In the absence of Pd, crotonaldehyde was formed, but the introduction of Pd leads to an isomerisation pathway to 3 -buten- 1 -ol being favoured over epoxidation and crotonaldehyde was a minor product...|$|R
40|$|Published online: 27 Oct 2014 The {{influence}} of water-miscible alcohols (methanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -propanol, and <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> on the isomerization of glucose to fructose and mannose was investigated under subcritical aqueous conditions (180 - 200  °C). Primary and secondary alcohols promoted the conversion and isomerization of glucose to afford fructose and mannose with {{high and low}} selectivity, respectively. On the other hand, the decomposition (side-reaction) of glucose was suppressed {{in the presence of}} the primary and secondary alcohols compared with that in subcritical water. The yield of fructose increased with increasing concentration of the primary and secondary alcohols, and the species of the primary and secondary alcohols tested had little effect on the isomerization behavior of glucose. In contrast, the isomerization of glucose was suppressed in subcritical aqueous <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Both the conversion of glucose and the yield of fructose decreased with increasing concentration of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> In addition, mannose was not detected in reactions using subcritical aqueous <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol...</b>|$|E
30|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid l-menthyl ester was hydrolyzed in water by the lipase from Candida rugosa {{with the addition}} of an organic solvent. The degree of hydrolysis (yield) greatly improved when a tertiary alcohol, such as <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> was added. However, the addition of a less polar solvent, such as hexane, decreased the degree of hydrolysis, and some water-miscible solvents, such as acetone, caused inactivation of the lipase. With the addition of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> the reaction mixture formed a one- or two-phase system, and the mixing ratio of substrates and <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> determined the number of phases. Although the degree of hydrolysis at 10 d was higher in the one-phase system, the initial reaction rate was generally lower. Meanwhile, the reaction was much faster in the two-phase system while maintaining a moderate degree of hydrolysis.|$|E
30|$|These results {{indicate}} that lipase from C. rugosa is not completely inactivated in a tertiary alcohol. On the other hand, other water miscible organic solvents, such as acetone and acetonitrile, readily inactivate the lipase. These facts contrast the fact that lipase from Candida antarctica (fraction B) shows a high catalytic activity not only in <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> but also in acetone and acetonitrile (Kobayashi et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2012). Based on these results, <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{was used for the}} following studies.|$|E

These are methanol, ethajiol and isopropyl alcohol. The {{aim of the}} project was to examine the process of induced decomposition. Thermal decomposition of t-hutyl hydroperoxide and sec-butyl hydroperoxide indicate that these reactions have first-order kinetics with activation energies on the order of 20 to 28 K cal/mole, Styrene was used as a free radical trap to inhibit the induced decomposition. The results permitted calculation of how much induced decomposition occurred in its absence. The experimental resvilts indicate that the induced decomposition is important for <b>t-butyl</b> hydroperoxide in <b>alcohol</b> solvents, as shown by both the reaction rate suid product studies. But sec-butyl hydroperoxide results show that the concerted mechanism for the interaction of two sec-butylperoxy radicals occurs in addition to the induced decomposition. Di-sodium E. D,T.

30|$|In the one-phase system, {{the initial}} {{reaction}} rates were ca. 1 – 4 fold {{higher than that}} of the control in most cases (Figure 2).

Meanwhile, the degree of hydrolysis at 10 d greatly improved to 42 – 68 % in all cases compared to that of the control as shown in Figure 3, maybe due to the high concentration of water in the reaction mixture. However, the addition of a large amount of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> lowers the substrate concentration. Therefore, performing the reaction under the one-phase state is not practical.|$|E
40|$|Tert-butyl alcohol, an {{important}} commodity chemical, additive to unleaded gasoline, and contaminant of drinking water, was evaluated for toxicity {{and was found}} to enhance nephropathy in male Fischer 344 rats. Because male rats treated with <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> for 2 years had a low incidence of renal cortical tumors, additional renal sections for the 90 -day toxicity study were examined {{for the presence of}} hyaline droplet accumulation, nephropathy, and evidence of replicative DNA synthesis (S-phase nuclei) to indirectly and retrospectively investigate a possible role of a- 2 p-globulin in the pathogenesis of the nephropathy. Dose levels for <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> were 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 % (w/v) administered in drinking water. Significant body weight gain depressions were observed in all treated males, and there was an absolute weight loss in the 4 % male group, none of which survived {{to the end of the}} study. Except for the 4 % dose group, there was a treatment-related increase in hyaline droplet accumulation in the renal proximal tubules with crystalline, rectangular, and rhomboid forms of the protein evident. The severity of nephropathy was enhanced in treated rats, except for the 4 % dose group. Replicative DNA synthesis, as measured by immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, was increased in proximal tubules of rats dosed with 2 % <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> It is concluded that <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> exacerbated nephropathy in male Fischer 344 rats and increased renal accumulation of hyaline protein material consistent with a- 2 p-globulin deposition...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, the {{addition}} of an organic solvent greatly affected the degree of hydrolysis of CLA menthyl ester by the lipase from C. rugosa. When tertiary alcohols, such as <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> were used, the degree of hydrolysis improved. The mixing ratio of substrates and <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> affected the number of phases, {{and the state of}} the phase much influenced the initial reaction rate and degree of hydrolysis. The initial reaction rate was generally lower in the one-phase system. In the two-phase system, the reaction was much faster, and a higher degree of hydrolysis could be achieved when the reaction mixture formed an emulsion. Therefore, to efficiently perform the hydrolysis, it is favorable to adopt the two-phase system in an emulsified form.|$|E

The existence of thermal discontinuities in the properties of liquid water is discussed and examples of spectroscopic 'kinks' are given. The construction and operation of a high pressure rig for spectrophotometric measurements of aqueous systems is described in detail.

The variation of the frequency of maximum absorption and band width of the charge transfer to solvent spectra of aqueous iodide, with temperature and pressure change, is explained using a simple two state model for liquid water. Supporting evidence for this model has been obtained from near-infrared studies of 6 M HOD/D 2 O solutions. The visible absorption spectra of Brooker's Dye VII in aqueous <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> solutions is very sensitive to added alcohol and this is attributed to a monomer-dimer equilibrium.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} chemistry of alcohols, which {{are widely used}} as motor vehicle fuels (e. g. ethanol in Brazil) and as industrial solvents, has been reviewed with focus on kinetic data and on reaction mechanisms. Oxidation of alcohols in the atmosphere involves their reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). Alcohol-OH reaction rate constants are presented for 33 saturated alcohols including monofunctional and difunctional compounds. The corresponding atmospheric half-lives are one week for methanol and <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> 2. 5 days for ethanol, and 8 - 15 h for other alcohols.

Major products are formaldehyde from methanol, acetaldehyde from ethanol, acetone from 2 -propanol, 2 -butanone and acetaldehyde from 2 -butanol and acetone and formaldehyde from <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The reaction of OH with alcohols involves H-atom abstraction from C-H bonds; H-atom abstraction from the O-H bond is negligible.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{possibilities}} for the low reaction rate at the higher ratio of t-butyl alcohol: 1) Low substrate concentration {{is directly related to}} the low reaction rate. 2) Water-miscible organic solvents cause unfolding of the protein (Klyosov et al. 1975) or elimination of water molecules from an enzyme molecule that are essential to maintain its catalytic activity (Krishna et al. 2001). Therefore, lipase may be gradually inactivated by the significant addition of <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> 3) A lipase molecule is generally adsorbed on the interface between the oil/water phases, and the interfacial activation produces the catalytic activity (Grochulski et al. 1993).

Gustavson has previously obtained 1 -(hydroxymethy 1) - 1 -cyclobutanol in 40 % yield by oxidation of methylenecyclobutane with dilute aqueous potassium permanganate. In the present investigation, 80 - 83 % yields were achieved by performic acid oxidation using a modification of the procedure employed by Roebuck and Adkins for {{the preparation of}} trans-cyclohexandiol- 1, 2. A 39 % yield was obtained in a single experiment using hydrogen peroxide in <b>t-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Oxidation of the glycol with lead tetraacetate in methylene chloride solution gave yields of cyclobutanone up to 90 %. Periodate oxidation of the glycol was not successful. The over-all yield of cyclobutanone from pentaerythritol was 40 %...|$|E
