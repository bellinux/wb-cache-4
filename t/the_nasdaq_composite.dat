40|$|The S&P 500 index rose by {{an average}} of 26 % per year between 1995 and 1999, while <b>the</b> tech-dominated <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>composite</b> index earned returns of {{approximately}} 42 % per year. Subsequently, in 2000, the market index fell by almost 11 %; at the same time, <b>the</b> <b>NASDAQ</b> fell by about 41 %. These changes reflect the way in which investors perceived high-tech firms as highly performing firms to be targeted by acquiring firms. In this paper, I examine the performance of bidders acquiring high-tech targets. First, I find positive abnormal returns for the bidders during 1996 - 2003. Using the market model and a control-firm approach, I find that abnormal returns were higher before the stock market crash of 2000. Second, I determine the relation between the characteristics of bidders and their excess returns. A positive relationship between managerial ownership and abnormal returns is observed. Third, I study the changes in the accounting-based performance measures of the bidders, and find that high-tech acquisitions completed before the crash were accompanied by poor post-acquisition performance, over a one-year comparison window. Finally, I also find evidence that cash-rich bidders acquired high-tech targets to seize growth opportunities, and as a result, earned high abnormal returns. Overall, my results suggest that investors were overoptimistic about the future performance of high-tech mergers, but have lowered their expectations over tim...|$|R

In 2000, daytime viewership of the network peaked at 343,000, around the time <b>the</b> <b>Nasdaq</b> <b>Composite</b> crossed 5000. However, when the dot-com bubble began to burst later that year, CNBC's viewing figures declined in tandem. The network's ratings steadily fell quarter after quarter, year after year, until bottoming in Q1 2005, with an average viewership of 134,000 during the day. From the bottom, the network, along with the markets, rebounded significantly – average daytime viewership (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) reached a 7-year high of 310,000 viewers {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. Coinciding with the extreme market volatility of the ongoing global economic crisis, ratings hit an all-time high of 416,000 in Q3. Although the figures remain considerably less than those achieved by Fox News and CNN today, it has still had a 210% increase in viewership since the beginning of 2005. Despite the viewership slump at the turn of the decade, CNBC has remained extremely profitable: average annual revenues top $500 million while profits for the network exceeded $333 million in 2007, making CNBC a cash cow for NBC Universal and its parent company, Comcast. CNBC is the second most profitable of NBC Universal's thirteen cable channels in the United States, behind only the USA Network.|$|E

40|$|We propose two {{rational}} expectation {{models of}} transient financial bubbles with heterogeneous arbitrageurs and positive feedbacks leading to self-reinforcing transient stochastic faster-than-exponential price dynamics. As {{a result of}} the nonlinear feedbacks, the termination of a bubble is found to be characterized by a finite-time singularity in the bubble price formation process ending at some potential critical time t̃_c, which follows a mean-reversing stationary dynamics. Because of the heterogeneity of the rational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the optimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the survival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The explicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlinear transformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence of bubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter estimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the price dynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles that are in the making and to forecast their termination time. The tests performed on three financial markets, the US S&P 500 index from 1 February 1980 to 31 October 2008, <b>the</b> US <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>composite</b> index from 1 January 1980 to 31 July 2008 and the Hong Kong Hang Seng index from 1 December 1986 to 30 November 2008, suggest the feasibility of advance bubble warning. ...|$|R

Robust {{alternatives to the}} Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator are presented. Under elliptical symmetry of the innovation vector, consistency results for M-estimation of the general conditional heteroscedasticity model are obtained. We also propose a robust estimator for the cross-correlation matrix and a diagnostic check for correct specification of the innovation density function. In a Monte Carlo experiment, the effect of outliers on different types of M-estimators is studied.

40|$|Syfte: Syftet med denna studie var att se hur och varför volatiliteten påverkades i DJIA, S&P 500 och <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> under IT-bubblan. Metod: Års- och månadsvolatiliteten för DJIA, S&P 500 och <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> har beräknats under 1995 - 2004 med hjälp av data från Yahoo Finance. Empiri: Resultatet visar att volatiliteten var väsentligt högre i <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> än vad den var i S&P 500 och DJIA som i sin tur höll en liknande volatilitet i förhållande till varandra. Analys: I analysen framträdde det att volatiliteten blev väsentligt högre i samband med att bubblan sprack under maj 2000 fram till dess att paniken lade sig kort efter maj 2002. Det fanns en hög överensstämmelse mellan denna rapport och övriga tidigare studier. Teorierna var mestadels väl applicerbara. Slutsats: Volatiliteten för DJIA, S&P 500 och <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> var som högst mellan 2000 och 2002 under undersökningsperioden 1995 - 2004. IT-bubblan uppstod samt sprack till följd av irrationellt investeringsbeteende bland investerarna på aktiemarknaden och paniken som uppstod efteråt gjorde att volatiliteten på aktiemarknaden höll sig förhållandevis hög fram tills den lade sig kort efter maj 2002. <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> hade högst volatilitet till följd av IT-bubblan medan DJIA och S&P 500 hade likvärdig volatilitet. Samtliga index följde ett liknande mönster, detta var troligtvis på grund av att företag från <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> kunde återfinnas i S&P 500 samt DJIA. Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to see {{how and why the}} {{volatility}} was affected in DJIA, S&P 500 and <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> during <b>the</b> Dot-com bubble. Method: The yearly and monthly volatility of DJIA, S&P 500 and <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> were computed with data from a period spanning 1995 - 2004, which were collected from Yahoo Finance. Empiricism: The results illustrate that the volatility was vastly higher in <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> than in DJIA and S&P 500 which in turn yielded a comparable volatility in relation to each other. Analysis: The analysis extracted the fact that the volatility rose considerably after the bubble burst during May 2000 and started waning after the panic died out circa May 2002. There were a relatively high harmony between the results of this report and the earlier studies which it was compared to. Conclusion: The volatility for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ 500 was higher between 200 and 2002 than {{during the rest of the}} observed period. The Dot-com bubble arose due to irrational investment behavior among investors and the panic which arose afterwards contributed to the increasing volatility which maintained a high level until it subsided after May 2002. <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>Composite</b> had <b>the</b> highest volatility during the Dot-com bubble while DJIA and S&P 500 had a similar volatility.

The performance is higher in <b>the</b> case of <b>Nasdaq</b> <b>Composite</b> which could be a paradox since it is a much more developed and efficient market.

When transaction costs are taken into account in a realistic way, the technical trading strategies fail in the majority of the cases to generate higher returns than a naIve buyand- hold strategy. It is proved that transaction costs generate an inflated effect on the total profits which can be more than double the nominal amount paid in these costs. The importance of trading cost has been underestimated by many previous studies mainly due to unrealistic ways for their calculation. The unsatisfactory performance of technical analysis during different time horizons and data is mainly due to its static nature that deprives the method from adjusting to the constantly changing market and economic conditions.
