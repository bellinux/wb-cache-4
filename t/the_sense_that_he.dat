5|$|In 1912, Frank {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization. The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was different.|$|E
25|$|According to Ayatollah Khu’i {{there is}} no doubt that Uthman {{collected}} the Quran during his time, but not in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> collected the verses and suras in one volume, but in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> united the Muslims on the reading of one authoritative recension. He also argues that the one reading on which Uthman united the Muslims was the one in circulation among most Muslims, and that it reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|Spade has no original. He {{is a dream}} man in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is {{what most}} of the private detectives I worked with {{would like to have}} been, and, in their cockier moments, thought they approached.|$|E
5000|$|He was so {{struck by}} the {{powerful}} visual effect of the strong colour and bold geometric design which spoke directly to <b>the</b> <b>senses,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was determined to rediscover the Suprematist and Constructivist art which had been lost and forgotten in the attics, studios and basements of Moscow and Leningrad.|$|R

50|$|Farthing's work is {{derivative}} of Hooker, Edmund Burke, and Tory thinkers of English patrimony. What set Farthing's work apart from theirs is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was addressing his defence of the British {{system from the}} perspective of outsider, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> what <b>he</b> was defending was no longer de rigueur politically.|$|R
25|$|Constant {{court cases}} against Him: Swamiji {{had to face}} many court cases filed against him. The basis of these cases was the Chitrapur Math Trust deed, which was very weak in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> was the sole trustee. This meant that anybody could find any small fault in the {{execution}} of developmental programs under the trust and the blame would fall on him. Swamiji came clean in all these court cases. The fact that a guru of a community {{had to go through}} trial in court cases, resulted in a character assassination of sorts.|$|E
25|$|Nadal is a clay court {{specialist}} in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has been extremely}} successful on that surface. Since 2005, he won ten times at Roland Garros, ten times at Monte Carlo, ten times at Barcelona and seven at Rome. However, Nadal has shed that label owing to his success on other surfaces, including holding simultaneous Grand Slam tournament titles on grass, hard courts, and clay on two separate occasions, winning eight Masters series titles on hardcourt, and winning the Olympic gold medal on hardcourt.|$|E
25|$|Makkali Gosala {{seems to}} have {{combined}} the ideas of older schools of thought into an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in niyati (destiny), svabhava (nature), and sangati (change), and possibly parinama, which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as ahetuvadin, vainayikavadin, ajnanavadin, and issarakaranavadin. According to him all beings undergo development (parinama). This culminates {{in the course of}} time (samsarasuddhi) in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of niyati (destiny), bhava (nature), and sangati (change). As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to niyativada (fatalism) only in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought that some future events like salvation for all were strictly determined.|$|E
50|$|Jean Bellande Joseph {{was born}} on October 23, 1944. He married and had seven {{children}} while working professionally as a tailor. He lived his life with <b>the</b> profound <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should share his successes with the disadvantaged. To <b>that</b> end, <b>he</b> supported several generations of rural children in their educations.|$|R

5000|$|Ann Hornaday {{described}} Jaden Smith as a revelation, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "proves <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> no mere {{beneficiary of}} dynastic largesse. Somber, self-contained and somehow believable {{as a kid}} for whom things don't come easily, <b>he</b> never conveys <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> desperate to be liked. 'The Karate Kid' winds up being so likable itself." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it a positive review, rating the film {{three and a half}} out of four stars, and calling it [...] "a lovely and well-made film that stands on its own feet". Claudia Puig of USA Today and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly each rated the film a 'B', stating [...] "the chemistry between Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan grounds the movie, imbuing it with sincerity and poignance" [...] and that the film is [...] "fun and believable".|$|R
25|$|Self-important, romantic, {{and nearly}} always wrong, Barney dreamed {{of the day}} he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever {{frustrated}} that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, three left arm spinners {{dominated}} the Indian domestic cricket scene. Along with Doshi there were, Padmakar Shivalkar from Bombay, & Rajinder Goel of Haryana & Delhi. Goel still holds {{the record for}} the highest number of wickets in the Ranji Trophy (640 at 17.14). Shivlakar holds the record for his team Mumbai. Years after years, they destroyed strong batting line ups in Indian cricket with the guile of their spin, only to be overlooked by the national selectors. The only reason was the presence of B.S. Bedi. With a world class left arm spinner readily available, the selectors were reluctant to give the others much chance. Thus, Shivalker and Goel had to content themselves with a few unofficial test matches against Sri Lanka. Goel was specially unlucky, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was originally selected to make his official Test Debut against WI at Delhi, in 1974–78. But a last minute change saw off spinner Venkat replacing him. Doshi, in that sense, can be considered to be the luckiest; at least he got the chance to represent India in full internationals. Nevertheless, he too lost the best years of his playing career waiting for his chance to come.|$|E

5000|$|Robert David Sullivan from The A.V. Club {{gave this}} episode a C, saying that [...] "there's {{not much to}} laugh at in yet another flat episode". He {{especially}} criticized the inclusion of Carell's character, commenting, [...] "Carell and his character, who has oddly normal body proportions for a Springfield resident, are not a great fit with the show. Carell speaks faster than everyone else, and he gets some uninterrupted, improv-like 'bits' <b>that</b> add to <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he’s</b> not really interacting with the other voice actors", though <b>he</b> adds <b>that</b> the character's personality was effective as a contrast to Fat Tony. However, he praised the Lisa subplot, saying, [...] "At least there's some fun, 'Treehouse Of Horror'-style animation here, as Lisa has a nightmare about riding a horse-sized grasshopper on a ranch full of giant insects..." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It's funny, I {{was looking}} back to the pilot {{and some of the}} early episodes and Michael was really lonely. You could really tell <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was on the outside, but he kind of fits in now. He's still the loose cannon in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> still got <b>the</b> temper and he's a little bit fiery, but he fits in a little more. That's due to the writing and that's due to me and the acting choices I made. He had to loosen up a little bit, but I miss the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was really an outsider. I wanted to soften him up ‘cause I thought he was too hard and, now that I've {{softened}} him up just a tad, I {{want to go back to}} that hard edge, so I'm playing around with him and I'm trying to just figure it all out."

500|$|Although Kunichika's Meiji-era works {{remained}} {{rooted in}} the traditions of his teachers, he {{made an effort to}} incorporate references to modern technology. In 1869 he did a series jointly with Yoshitoshi, a more [...] "modern" [...] artist in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> depicted faces realistically. In addition, Kunichika experimented with [...] "Western" [...] vanishing point perspective.|$|E
500|$|Despite his flaws, Saint-Just {{is often}} accorded {{respect for the}} {{strength}} of his convictions. Although his words and actions may be viewed as reprehensible, his commitment to them is rarely questioned: he was [...] "implacable but sincere". Like Robespierre, he was incorruptible in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> exhibited no attraction to material benefits but devoted himself entirely to the advancement of a political agenda.|$|E
500|$|Thompson claims Scissorhands {{is based}} on a pet dog of hers. [...] She {{described}} her dog as follows: [...] "he was the most soulful, yearning creature I ever met. She wanted to participate in everything. She didn’t need language to communicate. She communicated with her eyes." [...] She described the character as similar to Frankenstein's monster and Pinocchio in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "an outsider who wants to be an insider".|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to win a game at the 1998 World Cup, Georges Leekens chose a 4–3–3 {{arrangement}} for Belgium's second and third group matches. Robert Waseige, Belgium coach around 2000, said that [...] "above all, [...] 4–4–2 system [...] holy", in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left good attackers on the bench to keep his favourite formation. Wilmots opted for the 4–3–3 line-up again, {{with the intention of}} showing dominant football against any country.|$|E
500|$|... "Ulysses" [...] remains much admired, even as {{the twentieth}} century brought new interpretations of the poem. Professor of {{literature}} Basil Willey commented in 1956, [...] "In 'Ulysses' <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience. [...] comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did; the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end; spare, grave, free from excessive decoration, and full of firmly controlled feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of his debut solo album Justified in 2002, Timberlake thought he [...] "lost his voice" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not like what he was doing. He felt [...] "burnt-out" [...] after Justified; this partly changed his career's direction, {{and he took a}} break from the music {{industry}} and instead appeared in films. The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in the thriller Edison Force, filmed in 2004 and released on July 18, 2006.

Here you'll find his {{trademark}} street anthems replete with horns and barking, desolate monologues toward a silent God, and endless exploration of a chronically conflicted character.

Upon hearing the opener [...] "What They Don't Know," [...] an archetypal Swizz Beatz jam that stands among the best the duo ever concocted, it's almost impossible not to proclaim {{the return of the}} dog." [...] Huffington Post labeled DMX as past his prime, but also said [...] "The production on Undisputed is respectable with Swizz Beatz, J.R.

Instead, it's the R&B-flavored [...] "Cold World" [...] and [...] "No Love"." ...|$|R
5000|$|The fifth {{section is}} an {{examination}} of the problem of other minds. Moore argues that [...] "there are other 'selves'", but explains why this question has baffled philosophers.

However, the most distinctive features of this young squire are his compassion and his moral values which make him so endearing.On 28 March 1553, in his Journal, he mentioned the practice of distilling cider to make apple brandy, the first reference to the spirits known today as Calvados.|$|R
500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. [...] "I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that {{he was doing this}} out of love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him.|$|E
500|$|His {{blend of}} the {{classical}} and flamenco styles, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "new flamenco" [...] (nuevo flamenco), led music critic Eric McLean of the Montreal Gazette to proclaim: [...] "It is Laucke's interest in flamenco that makes him special: He might be called the first interpreter of flamenco music, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> borrows these traditional works by Sabicas, Carlos Montoya and Paco de Lucía, and employs them in his own fashion, a practice to which they agree." [...] Laucke summarized: [...] "The Spanish guitar remains my first love. The flamenco guitar is my passion." [...] According to The Music Scene magazine published by Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), he is one of [...] "five of Canada's best-known soloists" [...] and the Canadian federal and provincial governments gave him [...] "full recognition as the person who has done more for the guitar in this country than anyone else".|$|E
500|$|The title Christ, or Messiah, {{indicates}} that Jesus' followers believed {{him to be}} the anointed heir of King David, whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as [...] "the Messiah" [...] or, equivalently, [...] "the Christ". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as [...] "his Messiah". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the Messiah. The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not. Based on the Christian tradition, Gerd Theissen advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title [...] "Messiah". Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in, not in the sense that most people today think of the term.|$|E
60|$|Jude {{leaped out}} of arm's reach, and {{walked along the}} {{trackway}} weeping--not from the pain, though that was keen enough; not from {{the perception of the}} flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which what was good for God's birds was bad for God's gardener; but with <b>the</b> awful <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year in the parish, and hence might be a burden to his great-aunt for life.|$|R
