40|$|<b>Temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> {{inside the}} cabinet of a {{household}} refrigerator significantly affects {{the quality of}} preserved food. Phase change material (PCM) is a latent heat storage system that can store and release the heat energy by changing its phase from liquid to solid and solid to liquid respectively. Therefore, use of PCM inside the refrigerator cabinet {{has the potential for}} minimizing the <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> during the door opening and the power failure. However,very few studies in the literature were dedicated to investigating the role of PCM to reduce the <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> The aim of this work is to experimentally investigate the effects of PCM on <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> inside the cabinet of a household refrigerator during the door opening and power failure. The results found that a significantly lower <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> can be obtained using PCM. It was found that during the door opening condition the air temperature in the cabinet rose rapidly. However, when a PCM container was used, temperature variation was reduced to 3 - 5 °C. During the power failure, the system with PCM maintained a lower temperature inside the storage chamber {{for a long period of}} time (about two hours). Moreover,the test results indicate that PCM maintains more stable temperature in the foodstuffs inside the refrigerator. This reduction of <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> ultimately improves the quality of preserved food...|$|R

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed {{to take into account}} the conjugate heat transfer between water as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and PCM as thermal capacitor. A pulsating inlet temperature with constant inlet velocity is prescribed to represent temperature variation. The performance of thermal capacitor is evaluated by closely monitoring outlet temperature and comparing it with inlet temperature to examine the reduction in <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> To intensify heat transfer between HTF and PCM, extended surfaces (fins) are installed on PCM side. The results indicate that PCM thermal capacitor can reduce <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> by ∼ 1 °C. This reduction can be improved further when extended surface is installed with ∼ 1. 5 °C reduction in <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> is achieved. Moreover, it is found that the maximum temperature is delayed at the outlet due to slow conjugate heat transfer between HTF and PCM. Inlet velocity is found to have considerable influence of the <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> reduction: Slower inlet velocity results in a better <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> reduction. This study is expected to serve as a guideline in designing PCM-based thermal capacitor...|$|R

40|$|Land-use transition, energy consumption, and <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> are {{the three}} {{dominant}} topics we have investigated in this research. In the last century, 38 heat waves occurred in Europe, of which eleven were after 1900 and six after 2000 (IPCC, 2007).

Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine.

Especially, moist-chilling treatment and <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> promoted germination vigorously. The germination ratio slightly increased after hot water treatment on seed. As all dormant seeds {{are exposed to the}} moist-chilling condition during winter in the field, most of dispersed seeds seem to be germinable until spring.

The PCM is placed around the five sides of the evaporator cabinet in which the evaporator coil is immersed. The experimental results with PCM confirm the notable reduction of the fluctuation of the cabin temperature at lower load but at higher load this effect is not so significant. Between two PCM, the reduction of <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> for Eutectic solution is better than water PCM.

25|$|Intertidal organisms, {{especially}} those in the high intertidal, must cope with a large range of temperatures. While they are underwater, temperatures may only vary by a few degrees over the year. However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly hot, leading to a temperature range that may approach 30°C (86°F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide. Besides simply living at lower tide heights, non-motile organisms may be more dependent on coping mechanisms. For example, high intertidal organisms have a stronger stress response, a physiological response of making proteins that help recovery from temperature stress just as the immune response aids in the recovery from infection.|$|E
25|$|Mount Barker {{is one of}} the 5 {{nominated}} subregions of the Great Southern wine {{region in}} Western Australia, which is Australia's largest wine region with a rectangle 200 kilometres from east to west and over 100 kilometers from north to south. The area has been described as 'the birthplace of the Great Southern wine region' and has won numerous awards for a variety of wines. Situated {{as it is in the}} middle of the Great Southern, the continental aspects of the climate make this quintessential country for Riesling and Shiraz. While, as with the rest of the region, rainfall is winter-spring dominant, late vintage rains can create problems. Mount Barker's continentality also means greater diurnal <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and the occasional spring frost. The Plantagenet Plateau, with Mount Barker its centre point, is marked by its marri soils, lateritic gravelly/sandy loams coming directly from granite rock protusions.

Plantagenet Wines established in 1968 was one of the first wineries in the region and is located within the town boundary.|$|E
25|$|The storage {{condition}} of the bottled wine will influence a wine's aging. Vibrations and heat fluctuations can hasten a wine's deterioration and cause adverse effect on the wines. In general, a wine has a greater potential to develop complexity and more aromatic bouquet if it is allowed to age slowly in a relatively cool environment. The lower the temperature, the more slowly a wine develops. On average, the rate of chemical reactions in wine double with each 18°F (8°C) increase in temperature. Wine expert Karen MacNeil recommends keeping wine intended for aging in a cool area with a constant temperature around 55°F (13°C). Wine can be stored at temperatures as high as 69°F (20°C) without long term negative effect. Professor Cornelius Ough of the University of California, Davis believes that wine could be exposed to temperatures as high as 120°F (49°C) {{for a few hours}} and not be damaged. However, most experts believe that extreme <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> (such as repeated transferring a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) would be detrimental to the wine. The ultra-violet rays of direct sunlight should also be avoided because of the free radicals that can develop in the wine and result in premature oxidation.|$|E

Due to the high thermal mass of pavement materials, seasonal <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> under the pavement is much less than the <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of ambient air. Therefore, pavements can be utilised as a low grade heat source during winter and as a heat sink during summer. Airports, for example, provide a key potential application as they are very large consumers of energy, typically have very high cooling demands, have a large amount of adjacent pavement area, and are of a similar arrangement throughout the world. In this paper, the temperature distribution into pavements with different thermo-physical properties was modelled in order to evaluate their effects on depth of seasonal <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> The results show that there is a linear relationship between the thermal diffusivity and depth of seasonal <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and it decreases in relation to the thermal diffusivity of the pavement...|$|R
