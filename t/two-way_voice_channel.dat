5000|$|MLX {{telephones}} use an unpublished digital {{communications protocol}} based on ISDN S interface. They connect to their host system using an 8-position 8-conductor connector, however only the middle 4 positions are actually used. The processing for an MLX telephone is done principally by its host - the keypad and display {{is essentially the}} equivalent of a dumb terminal contained inside the set. There are provisions for two independent <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> <b>channels</b> and the data channel (similar to ISDN BRI) going to a single telephone set. Because each channel is <b>two-way,</b> the two <b>voice</b> <b>channels</b> are rarely used simultaneously, except for example, when a voice [...] "paging" [...] announcement comes over the speakerphone while somebody is using the line, or if an additional [...] "multi-function-module" [...] accessory is attached to the phone that permits the second <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> {{to be used as a}} normal analog telephone line, such as for a modem or fax machine.|$|R

40|$|This paper conceptualizes {{mobile phones}} as beyond <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> {{communication}} technologies, envisioning the mobile device {{as a social}} collective medium instead of a private personal technology. It addresses three central research questions: (1) What are the characteristics of mobile phones that differentiates them from traditional fixed phones? (2) What are some current uses of mobile interfaces that transform them into social collective media instead of private <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> communication devices? (3) What are the possible future developments of the mobile interface that these characteristics might lead to? Taking into consideration that new meanings for new interfaces are culturally and socially created, the paper addresses the emergence of social mobile networks created via mobile technologies. These networks emerge when cell phone use shifts from mobile telephone to a type of micro-computer, location aware device and internet connection interface...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} acoustic-phonetics of coronal stop production by adult simultaneous bilingual and monolingual speakers of Canadian English (CE) and Canadian French (CF). Differences in the phonetics of CF and CE include voicing {{and place of}} articulation distinctions.

CF also has a <b>two-way</b> <b>voicing</b> distinction, but contrasting lead and short-lag VOT; coronal stops in CF are described as dental. Acoustic analyses of stop consonants for both VOT and dental/alveolar place of articulation are reported. Results indicate that simultaneous bilingual as well as monolingual adults produce language-specific differences, albeit {{not in the same}} way, across CF and CE for voicing and place.

40|$|Many {{theories}} of phonology {{assume that the}} sound structure of language {{is made up of}} distinctive features, but there is considerable debate about how much articulatory detail distinctive features encode in long-term memory. Laryngeal features such as voicing provide a unique window into this question: while many languages have two-way contrasts that can be given a simple binary feature account [±VOICE], the precise articulatory details underlying these contrasts can vary significantly across languages. Here, we investigate a series of <b>two-way</b> <b>voicing</b> contrasts in English, Arabic, and Russian, three languages that implement their voicing contrasts very differently at the articulatory-phonetic level. In three event-related potential experiments contrasting English, Arabic, and Russian fricatives along with Russian stops, we observe a consistent pattern of asymmetric mismatch negativity (MMN) effects that is compatible with an articulatorily abstract and cross-linguistically uniform way of marking <b>two-way</b> <b>voicing</b> contrasts, as opposed to an articulatorily precise and cross-linguistically diverse way of encoding them. Regardless of whether a language is theorized to encode [VOICE] over [SPREAD GLOTTIS], the data is consistent with a universal marking of the [SPREAD GLOTTIS] feature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Nowadays, GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> {{network is}} the most {{consumed}} by mobile communication users in the world [1]. However, the GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> network is currently vulnerable to hardware-based attacks and easy to be intercepted [2]. Current end-to-end secure communication solutions over the GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> network have a big challenge {{on how to get}} an efficient synchronization of cryptographic devices on both ends. The efficient synchronization method helps to recover fully the original voice after decryption with very minimize delay and distortion. This paper presents an enhanced synchronization system for the synchronization improvement by manipulating the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) coded voice from/to the cryptographic devices at both ends. The system is developed for simple, low-cost and consumable by various segments of society such as public, banking, military and government...|$|R
