500|$|On November 24, 2014, Sandoval [...] {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the Boston Red Sox on a five-year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out. The deal was officially announced on November 25. Sandoval said, [...] "It was a tough decision for me. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to be sure that I was going to make the right decision... But I want a new challenge. I made that choice to be here in Boston because I need a new challenge." [...] In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval batted [...]245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first full season in 2009.|$|E

Sports, Jackson says that: [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time to get}} over the fact that I {{was the only one that}} didn't make it to the NBA from the Fab Five, but I'm over it because I'm back home and I'm happy with what I'm doing with my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tiffany {{was created}} as a new love {{interest}} for established character; Chris Warner. Alison James, who had theatre background, was cast in the role. After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy {{to walk away from}} something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me and I was there, but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "I've {{come back}} to stay. It's <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while to learn it, but there's only one place for a man, and that's his own country." ...|$|R
2500|$|Reflecting in 1993 on his {{relatively}} late {{start in}} writing fiction, DeLillo said [...] "I wish I had started earlier, but evidently I wasn’t ready. First, I lacked ambition. I {{may have had}} novels in my head but very little on paper and no personal goals, no burning desire to achieve some end. Second, I didn’t {{have a sense of}} {{what it takes to be}} a serious writer. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to develop this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bright {{attributed}} {{his poor}} form {{in part to}} his league stint in England, saying [...] "the wickets were so slow that I ended up bowling a lot quicker. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> long time to renegotiate what I needed to do in Australian conditions." [...] He added that [...] "another thing was that the batsman weren't taking any risks against me. Before that I suppose they had underestimated me, but after I was selected for New Zealand they took no risks and I had to really fight for my wicket." ...|$|E
2500|$|Levy {{has said}} that his views on Israel's {{policies}} toward the Palestinians developed only after joining Haaretz. [...] "When I first started covering the West Bank for Haaretz, I was young and brainwashed," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. [...] "I would see settlers cutting down olive trees and soldiers mistreating Palestinian women at the checkpoints, and I would think, 'These are exceptions, not part of government policy.' It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to see that these were not exceptions – they were the substance of government policy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps, as I've {{only just}} arrived," [...] she remarked, [...] "I might be forgiven if I {{do not change}} my skirt. I packed so hurriedly that it will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to find my things." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
6000|$|... "The woman met me," [...] she continued, [...] "and <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{way from}} the station to a little house. She tried to take me upstairs. She said you were waiting for me, but I {{looked up and saw}} Captain Horton peeping over the banisters--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was a he, then," [...] said I. [...] "We {{were the}} two best lads at my father's school, and we thought we loved each other dearly. Well, the time came {{when he went to}} Glasgow to a merchant's house, that was his second cousin once removed; and wrote me two-three times by the carrier; and then he found new friends, and I might write till I was tired, he took no notice. Eh, Catriona, it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while to forgive the world. There is not {{anything}} more bitter than to lose a fancied friend." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{first saw}} England, {{she was in}} {{mourning}} for the young Princess Charlotte, {{the hope of the}} empire. I came from India as a child, and our ship touched at an island on the way home, where my black servant <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk over rocks and hills until we reached a garden, where we saw a man walking. “That is he,” said the black man: “that is Bonaparte! He eats three sheep every day, and all the little children he can lay hands on!” There were people in the British dominions besides that poor Calcutta serving-man, with an equal horror of the Corsican ogre.|$|E
60|$|The work <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. When at last I {{folded up}} {{the papers and}} slipped them once more inside my blouse it was close upon two. I {{wondered}} why Theodore had not returned with our luncheon, but on going to the little anteroom which divides my office from the outer door, great was my astonishment to see him lolling there on the rickety chair which he affectioned, and half asleep. I had some difficulty in rousing him. Apparently he had got rather drunk while he was out, and had then returned and slept some of his booze off, without thinking that I might be hungry and needing my luncheon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but, Sam, what am I {{going to}} do if that money isn't gotten back? The Sandersons can't afford to lose it, and even if I went to work right away, it would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> long time to earn four {{thousand}} dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> mighty <b>long</b> {{while to}} {{straighten}} this thing up; but I'll do it somehow," [...] he said, and Sam replied, roughly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time to find}} out!" [...] she said, rather ruefully; and {{she could}} promise me this {{satisfaction}} neither for that night nor for the next. I was patient now, however, for I felt that I had only to wait; and in fact {{at the end of}} the week, one lovely evening after dinner, she stepped into my gondola, to which in honor of the occasion I had attached a second oar.|$|R
6000|$|... "And this stuff," [...] he continued, [...] "will {{set you up}} {{in a day or}} two. It's as good as quinine, any day; and you've no notion what {{wonderful}} cures that medicine effects. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, too, to {{find the}} right tree. I wandered over two or three leagues of country before I came upon one. Luckily it was a fine sunny day, and I enjoyed it much. I wish you had been with me, Tom; but you'll be all right soon. I lay down, too, once or twice in the sunshine, and put my head in the long grass, and tried to fancy myself in a miniature forest. Did you ever try that, Tom!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's queer.... But perhaps--a son is different. Now I come {{to think}} of it--I've never talked of Mary.... Not to any one ever. I've never thought of that before. But I haven't. I couldn't. No. Losing a lover, that's a thing for oneself. I've been through that, you see. But a son's more outside you. Altogether. And more your own making. It's not losing a thing in you; it's losing a hope and a pride.... Once when I was a little boy I did a drawing very carefully. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time.... And a big boy tore it up. For no {{particular}} reason. Just out of cruelty.... That--that was exactly like losing Hugh...." ...|$|E
6000|$|It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, and it {{had cost}} us both much {{grateful}} and painful emotion, before I had finally managed to refuse his offer and compounded {{for a bottle of}} particular wine. He dropped the subject at last suddenly with a [...] "Never mind; that's all done with"; nor did he again refer to the subject, though we passed together the rest of the afternoon, and I accompanied him, on his departure, to the doors of the waiting-room at St. Lazare. I felt myself strangely alone; a voice told me that I had rejected both the counsels of wisdom and the helping hand of friendship; and as I passed through the great bright city on my homeward way, I measured {{it for the first time}} with the eye of an adversary.|$|E

"The {{animosity}} shown {{towards me}} by your father," [...] he wrote, in this coldest of marital epistles, [...] "is such that I cannot return again to a roof which is his, {{even though it}} shelters you. A parting is unavoidable, as you are sure {{to be on his}} side in this division. I am starting on a journey which will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way from Hintock, and you must not expect to see me there again for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{will not}} regard <b>me</b> as <b>a</b> madman, I am sure. It {{is a very}} {{rational}} aberration at least {{to try to put}} your beliefs into practice. Strangely enough, it has <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to see this distinctly with regard to my whole creed; but I have seen it at last, praised be my sickness and my leisure! I have seen it at last; the sun of my duty has risen; I have enlisted for the first time, and after long coquetting with the shilling, under the banner of the Holy Ghost![10] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Six dollars. Think of it! A boat like this! Of course I {{done a lot}} of work, an' {{the sail}} cost two dollars, the oars one forty, an' the paint one seventy-five. But just the same eleven dollars and fifteen cents is a real bargain. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time saving for it, though. I carry papers morning and evening--there's a boy taking my route for me this afternoon--I give 'm ten cents, an' all the extras he sells is his; and I'd a-got the boat sooner only I had to pay for my {{shorthand}} lessons. My mother wants me to become a court reporter. They get sometimes as much as twenty dollars a day. Gee! But I don't want it. It's a shame to waste the money on the lessons." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning I trekked very early from Umbezi's kraal--before he was up indeed, for the [...] "squareface" [...] made him sleep sound. My destination was Nodwengu, Panda's Great Place, where I hoped to do some trading, but, as I was in no particular hurry, my plan was to go round by Masapo's, and see for myself how it fared between him and Mameena. Indeed, I reached {{the borders of the}} Amasomi territory, whereof Masapo was chief, by evening, and camped there. But with the night came reflection, and reflection told me that I should do well to keep clear of Mameena and her domestic complications, if she had any. So I changed my mind, and next morning trekked on to Nodwengu by the only route that my guides reported to be practicable, one which <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way round.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{the road}} was clear, and about {{three o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} I was at St Denis, though it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> two hours to get from there to Paris, for {{the road was}} blocked with commissariat waggons and guns of the artillery reserve, which was going north to Marmont and Mortier. You cannot conceive the excitement which my appearance in such a costume made in Paris, and when I came to the Rue de Rivoli I should think I had {{a quarter of a mile}} of folk riding or running behind me. Word had got about from the dragoons (two of whom had come with me), and everybody knew about my adventures and how I had come by my uniform. It was a triumph--men shouting and women waving their handkerchiefs and blowing kisses from the windows.|$|E
5000|$|Borland writes {{songs by}} forming them in rough {{outlines}} and {{filling in the}} details later. According to Borland, [...] "I'm good at creating ideas while using a guitar in a new way, but it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. I can't just come up with stuff fast and rip it up. I think about constructing songs, and even riffs, {{in the same way}} as a painting, putting on a little bit at a time. They're sketchy at first, and then I know what I want, and I fit notes into places." ...|$|R
5000|$|Swift {{has said}} that the song was [...] "the hardest to write on the album", saying: [...] "it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> really <b>long</b> time to filter through {{everything}} I wanted to put in the song without it being a 10-minute song, which you can’t put on an album. I wanted a story that could work {{in the form of a}} song and I called my co-writer Liz Rose and said, ‘Come over, we’ve gotta filter this down,’ and it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> really <b>long</b> time to get it." [...] Rose also {{has said that}} the song was originally [...] "10, 12 or 15 minutes long" [...] before cutting down to [...] "the important pieces".
