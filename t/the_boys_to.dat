5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction from their mothers {{in the art of}} spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E
5|$|The three Miller boys played Australian rules {{football}} {{in winter and}} cricket in summer. Their {{father had been a}} successful local cricketer and taught <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> play with an orthodox and classical technique, relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford. At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south east. As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.|$|E
5|$|When King was a child, he befriended a {{white boy}} whose father owned a {{business}} near his family's home. When {{the boys were}} six, they started school: King had to attend a school for African Americans and the other boy went to one for whites (public schools were among the facilities segregated by state law). King lost his friend because the child's father no longer wanted <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> play together.|$|E

5|$|Drewett {{emigrated to}} Australia in 1884, causing <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> be uprooted {{as they went}} to live with Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined St Paul's School there. He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading {{literature}} and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic. A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in Shepherd's Bush, London, from 1884 to 1887. The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, Henry Cotton.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|Having {{misunderstood}} {{the news}} about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean, Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned, and asks <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> join him in becoming a pirate in {{what he describes as}} a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of their expectations.|$|E

5|$|In July 1906, Ernest Thompson Seton sent Baden-Powell {{a copy of}} his 1902 book The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians. Seton, a British-born Canadian-American {{living in}} the United States, met Baden-Powell in October 1906, and they shared ideas about youth {{training}} programs. In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called Boy Patrols. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds (from boy's schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole, Parkstone, Hamworthy, Bournemouth, and Winton Boys' Brigade units) and held a week-long camp in August on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset, England. His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training, allowed <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys ran {{across the street to}} tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} in the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers heard the story, he urged <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would get in trouble. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E
5|$|Two {{accounts}} exist {{regarding the}} adoption of Rakotomavo, whom Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana designated to rule after him as King Andriambelomasina. According to the first version, Rakotomavo and Mandriamohara were sons of Rangorimanana. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana sent messengers to Ranorimanana to bring <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> him with the instructions {{to take note of}} which child stood closer to the central pillar (andry, symbolic of strength) of their mother's house. When the boys entered the house, Rakotomavo stood closer to the pillar. The children's relatives refused to allow the messengers to take the children, so the king sent them back with rice, milk, honey and other goods and successfully lured the boys away.|$|E

5|$|Although Jones took {{no part in}} {{the raising}} of his {{children}} by Tuhbenahneequay, he did take an active interest in their welfare. In 1805, he secured a pair of two-square-mile plots of land {{near the mouth of}} the Credit River for his two sons from the local Mississauga Indians, but the government of Upper Canada would not recognise the title. In 1816, Jones feared that the Mississauga band his sons John and Peter lived with would fall apart, {{in the aftermath of the}} War of 1812, the famine of 1816's harvest and the influx of settlers to the area in recent years. Jones travelled to find the boys, and brought them to his farm in Stoney Creek. He arranged for <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> be schooled in Stoney Creek, as neither spoke much English. After nine months, Jones felt that Peter's command of English was sufficient, and took him out of school to teach him the farming craft. The next year, Jones and his family relocated to land along the Grand River, and Jones brought his son Peter with them. Peter lived with his father for seven years there.|$|E
5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E

25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>to</b> help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help.
