5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It {{appears to be a}} {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E

He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} major general, Godley, {{together with}} fourteen British Army officers seconded to the New Zealand Military Forces, was tasked with reorganising and instilling professionalism {{in the military}} establishment of the country. Compulsory military training had recently been introduced by the government but with little <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> to its implementation. In refining the New Zealand Military Forces, Godley drew heavily on the recommendations of Lord Herbert Kitchener, who had visited New Zealand {{earlier in the year}} on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|The ideal he {{expressed}} in a work of the period, Equilibru între antithesi ("A Balance between Antitheses") was moderate progressivism, with the preservation of social peace. In Tudor Vianu's view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, Equilibru, with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> well as vaguer ones from that of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Nonetheless, his system parted with Hegelianism in that, instead of seeking {{a balance between the}} Geist and existence, it considered the three states of human progress (Thesis, antithesis, synthesis) the reflection of a mystical number favored throughout history.|$|E

5|$|Amman has {{a mostly}} Sunni Muslim population, {{and the city}} {{contains}} numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-coloured walls and Persian carpets. It was built by a Circassian resident of Amman. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.|$|E
5|$|Now {{a prince}} (pangeran), Amir {{was given the}} title Tengku Pangeran Indra Putera. He lived with Kamiliah in their own home. By all accounts, she was a devout and loving wife, and in 1939 the couple had their only child, a {{daughter}} named Tengku Tahura. According to Dini, Amir professed to Kamiliah that he could never love her as he had Sundari and that he felt obligated to marry her, something which Kamiliah reportedly accepted. The poet retained an album with his Javanese sweetheart's photographs at home and would often isolate himself from his family, lost in <b>thought.</b> <b>As</b> a prince of Langkat, Amir became a court official, handling administrative and legal matters, and at times judging criminal cases. He once represented the sultanate at the funeral of PakubuwonoX in Java– Amir's last trip to the island.|$|E
