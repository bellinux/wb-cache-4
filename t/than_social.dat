5|$|Đính's {{political}} stay was brief, as General Nguyễn Khánh, who was disgruntled at {{not receiving}} a high position after Diệm's removal, deposed the MRC {{with the support}} of Khiệm on 30 January 1964, without firing a shot. Khánh used the coup to exact retribution against Generals Đôn, Đính, Xuan and Lê Văn Kim. Khánh had them arrested, claiming that {{they were part of a}} neutralist plot with the French government of President Charles de Gaulle to make a peace deal with North Vietnam that would not end communism. Khánh noted they had all served in the French-backed VNA prior to 1955, although he had as well. He also accused the four generals of discussing such a plan with some visiting politicians from de Gaulle's party during a dinner, although Đính and his accused colleagues denied that the meeting was anything more <b>than</b> <b>social.</b> The generals were flown to Mỹ Khe beach, near Đà Nẵng.|$|E

25|$|Environmental determinism, {{also known}} as climatic or {{geographical}} determinism, proposes that the physical environment, rather <b>than</b> <b>social</b> conditions, determines culture.

25|$|The {{frequency}} of lynchings rose during years of poor economy and low prices for cotton, demonstrating that more <b>than</b> <b>social</b> tensions generated the catalysts for mob {{action against the}} underclass. Researchers have studied various models to determine what motivated lynchings. One study of lynching rates of blacks in southern counties between 1889 and 1931 found a relation to the concentration of blacks {{in parts of the}} Deep South; where black population was concentrated, lynching rates were higher. Such areas also had a particular mix of socioeconomic conditions, with a high dependence on cotton cultivation.|$|E

25|$|The Mission, {{founded by}} Vivekananda in 1897, is an {{humanitarian}} organisation which carries out medical, relief and educational programs.

Though the Mission with its branches is a distinct legal entity, it {{is closely related to}} the Math. The elected trustees of the Math also serve as Mission's Governing Body. Vedanta Societies comprise the American arm of the Movement and work more in purely spiritual field rather <b>than</b> <b>social</b> welfare.|$|E
25|$|Finding himself disoriented, {{he sought}} shelter and solace in his {{friendship}} with the Tagore brothers. There he overcame his crisis and started moving towards a religious rather <b>than</b> <b>social</b> and political outlook on life. Along with Dvijendranath Tagore, Kedarnath started studying Sanskrit and theological writings of such authors as Kant, Goethe, Hegel, Swedenborg, Hume, Voltaire, and Schopenhauer, {{as well as the}} books of Brahmo Samaj that rekindled his interest in Hinduism. At the same time, Kedarnath daily met with Charles Dall, a Unitarian minister from the American Unitarian Association of Boston posted to Calcutta for propagating Unitarian ideas among the educated Bengalis. Under Dall's guidance, Kedarnath studied the Bible and the Unitarian writings of Channing, Emerson, Parker and others. While developing a fascination for the liberalism of Unitarian religious teachings, the young Kedarnath also studied the Qur'an.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{study of}} Chinese social science {{studies in the}} Social Sciences Citation Index found a slow {{increase}} until 1999. The 1999-2007 period saw a very rapid increase. However, in 2007 China still only contributed 1.39% of the studies and mainland China only surpassed Hong Kong in 2006. Economics & business had larger share <b>than</b> <b>social,</b> political & communication science and psychology. The low share of social sciences compared to natural sciences may reflect {{that this is a}} common pattern in Asian nations, that Chinese social scientists publish in national journals not included in the Index and have less career incitements regarding publishing in international journals, and that state ideology and control is more important for social sciences than natural sciences. In China natural sciences are administered by the Ministry of Science and Technology while social sciences are administered by the National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences which may hinder inter-disciplinary collaboration.|$|E

25|$|Having {{lived in}} the steel town of Wheeling, West Virginia, Davis had {{first-hand}} experience with the controversies and hardships associated with industrialism. She utilizes the theme of industrialism in Life in the Iron Mills by {{calling attention to the}} dark and dismal setting of the iron mills. She not only provides vivid imagery of the dismal landscape, but imagery of the working class as well. By exploring the effects of the iron mills on its inhabitants, Davis is able to depict her own concerns and frustrations associated with the marginalization of the working class. Davis's depiction of the daily routines of the laboring class is a common theme throughout her writing, and most importantly serves the purpose of unveiling the maltreatment of such individuals. Her goal in relating the physical and mental starvation that plagues the inhabitants of these mills is to urge her audience to form spiritual solutions to these issues rather <b>than</b> <b>social</b> solutions.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} is obligated {{under current law}} to make mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing. The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8trillion. This is the amount that {{would have had to}} be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding <b>than</b> <b>Social</b> Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62trillion. However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt, as shown in monthly Treasury reports of the national debt.|$|E
25|$|Demonstrating courage is {{fundamental}} to masculinity in Bara culture. Historically, kings were required to lead the advance in combat, placing themselves in danger first; the others {{were not allowed to}} protect him or come to his aid unless he was injured or exhausted. Cattle raiding is a major feature of Bara culture. Traditionally a rite of passage for young men to prove their worth and courage to a prospective wife's family and the larger community, the practice is currently outlawed but remains widespread throughout the southwest and south-central Bara territories. Young men could not expect to marry respectably without first having successfully stolen at least one or two cattle in a raid. Today, cattle rustlers (dahalo) are increasingly armed bandits stealing cattle for wealth rather <b>than</b> <b>social</b> prestige. Zebu wrestling is a sport practiced by Bara communities and involves Zebu being penned into an arena and whipped into frustration. Once the zebu is angry, players sneak up behind the Zebu and jump onto its hump, attempting to 'ride' as long as possible without being injured by the beast. It is seen as a rite of passage for young boys.|$|E
