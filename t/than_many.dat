5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for <b>than</b> <b>many</b> modern breeds.|$|E

5|$|As of the {{election}} of Vincent Schoemehl as the city's youngest mayor ever in 1981, St. Louis's problems were more significant <b>than</b> <b>many</b> other rustbelt cities. Several major development projects incomplete and the city's economic base crumbling. However, Schoemehl developed two projects early in his three terms in office that assisted St. Louis: Operation Brightside provided city beautification through plantings and graffiti cleanup. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address crime, known as Operation SafeStreet, which blocked access to certain through streets and provided low-cost security measures to homeowners. Crime declined starting in 1984, and despite a small resurgence in 1989, continued to decline through the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{were among}} the wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} agriculture. For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and migratory birds were eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better <b>than</b> <b>many</b> plant materials. For example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E
5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment <b>than</b> <b>many</b> of his colleagues on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v.

He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not {{within the scope of}} the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker <b>than</b> <b>many</b> of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
