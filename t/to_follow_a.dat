In central Orleans County, NY18 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at the Lakeside Beach State Park. The parkway then becomes the lakeside road, and NY18 veers south <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> more inland routing.|$|E

5|$|Darwaza was {{convinced}} that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking.

5|$|Most of NY37B west of Massena {{ran through}} a low-lying area along the St. Lawrence River.

As a result, NY37B was rerouted <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> new roadway along the fringe of Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY37 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY37 and NY37B in Louisville was designated as NY131 by 1960. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY37B on its modern alignment.|$|E

Congress sailed along in pursuit, but was interrupted when President began pursuing HMS Belvidera on 23 June. Congress trailed behind President during the chase and fired her bowchasers at the escaping Belvidera. Unable to capture Belvidera, the squadron returned {{to the pursuit of}} the Jamaican fleet. On 1 July they began <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaican fleet had left behind them. Sailing to within one day's journey of the English Channel, the squadron never sighted the convoy and Rodgers called off the pursuit on the 13th. During their return trip to Boston, Congress assisted in the capture of seven merchant ships, including the recapture of an American vessel.|$|E
5|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} ranges from , {{though it is}} generally unpredictable. More than 85% of annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. Precipitation is highly variable {{from year to year}} and appears <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E

The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah {{was trained}} as a {{barrister}} at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and {{took an interest in}} national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{was popular}} {{in the time of}} Ashoka but {{vanished}} by the 12th century CE. Certain Hindu communities such as the Kshatriyas, certain Ambalavasi castes, Nairs, Tiyyas and the Muslims around North Malabar used <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> traditional matrilineal system known as marumakkathayam, although this practice ended in the years after Indian independence. Other Muslims, Christians, and some Hindu castes such as the Namboothiris, most of the Ambalavasi castes and the Ezhavas followed makkathayam, a patrilineal system. Owing to the former matrilineal system, women in Kerala enjoy a high social status. However, gender inequality among low caste men and women is reportedly higher compared to that in other castes.|$|E
