Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E

5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the lip sync and {{did not think it}} would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
