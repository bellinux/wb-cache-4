25|$|End Winning Streak: If {{one player}} wins last three {{tricks of the}} round, it is worth either 3 points or 30. Some {{varieties}} include awarding points for winning <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> tricks with same point gauge. If this rule is enforced, and an opposing team ends a possible streak by taking the last trick, the points may be awarded to that team instead of the team who had the streak.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} in Foo Fighters are {{nonsensical}} lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As the frontman, Grohl explained, [...] "I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there was too much to say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I look at them and some of them seem to actually have meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as [...] "This Is a Call", defined as [...] "a 'hello' and a 'thank you'" [...] to everyone that had {{played a key role in}} Grohl's life; the playful [...] "For All the Cows"; and [...] "Wattershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's [...] "love of hardcore and old school punk rock".|$|E

Since meaningful Fisher effect tests critically depend on the integration and cointegration properties of the variables, we present some empirical evidence on these issues and we also apply the Kalman filter to estimate the time-varying parameters.

The possible reasons for the inability to detect a full Fisher effect are also discussed. ...|$|R

The concern is that chemotherapy could cause more harm than good in a palliative situation; this is even truer as the patient nears death.

METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of patient charts, we investigated whether cancer patients had been treated with chemotherapy during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> two weeks of life.

40|$|A {{modified}} two-component {{regulatory system}} {{consisting of two}} response regulators, CorR and CorP, and the histidine protein kinase CorS, regulates the thermoresponsive production of the phytotoxin coronatine (COR) in Pseudomonas syringae PG 4180. COR is produced at the virulence-promoting temperature of 18 6 C, but not at 28 6 C, the optimal growth temperature of PG 4180. Assuming that the highly hydrophobic N-terminus of CorS might be involved in temperature-signal perception, the membrane topology of CorS was determined using translational phoA and lacZ fusions, leading to a topological model for CorS with six transmembrane domains (TMDs). Interestingly, three PhoA fusions located downstream of the sixth TMD showed a thermoresponsive phenotype. Enzymic activity, immunoblot, and protease-sensitivity assays were performed to localize the CorS derivatives, to analyse the expression level of hybrid proteins and to examine the model. In-frame deletions of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four,</b> <b>or</b> all six TMDs gave rise to non-functional CorS.
