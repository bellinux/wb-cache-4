25|$|Mahavira: I shall {{describe}} the truly insupportable pains {{where there is}} distress and (the punishment of) evil deeds. Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings {{for the sake of}} his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run. Going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> a burning heap of coals on fire, and being burnt they cry horribly; they remain there long, shrieking aloud.|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E

3000|$|We {{have thought}} about it [moving] several times but we won’t be able <b>to</b> {{establish}} <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this somewhere else {{with this kind of}} house and these surroundings. (Interview # 16) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for this advice, Quartermaster, which is the more {{acceptable}} as it costs nothing; but I do not think it belongs to my gifts <b>to</b> yield <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this while food and water last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. The Tenth {{was ordered}} to Manchester, and they could hardly expect me to go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that. Besides, I found the major monstrous rude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean {{by coming}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this?" [...] Lessingham queried, {{looking around the}} crowded restaurant. [...] "We are not, in that case, the only sinners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should Mr. Dale come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this?" [...] {{he asked}} himself. He knew {{the teacher to}} be a model man, who did not drink or gamble.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would hardly}} go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Matching in your present position. There {{are so many}} people whom you should entertain! You would {{probably}} have two or three of the foreign ministers down for a time." ...|$|R
5000|$|Team {{president}} and chief operating officer Don Logan said [...] "It's disappointing that Vegas has the worst facility in our league when we have such a great town with the greatest hotels, the greatest dining, the greatest shopping. It's not becoming of this community <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father says}} it's very unusual for such <b>a</b> young man <b>to</b> be in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> his. Mr. Witherby really leaves {{everything}} to him, he says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tis dishgraceful,' he sez, 'that I {{would be}} {{expected}} to go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that. Was she a pretty woman?'' he sez, an' at that he set off double quick.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must be mistaken, Tom," [...] {{came from}} the eldest Rover boy. [...] "Old Crabtree must be around Cedarville or in Ithaca. He would have no call to come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fancy dresses even in calico {{are very}} expensive. Besides, I {{could not go}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Rotherwood without at least two new dresses, {{and it is not}} right to put papa to more expense.' ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Dr Jeremy Taylor [...] "sites like Burrough Hill {{were the}} nearest {{thing we have}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> town before <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Leicester ever existed".|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no. You're {{very far}} from the mark. Kenwardine {{certainly}} likes a bet and sometimes runs a bank, but all he wins wouldn't do much <b>to</b> keep up <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this. However, you can see for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I {{go to my}} work," [...] {{said the}} latter, [...] "it is my habit {{to sit here and}} enjoy the scenery and a few puffs. I suppose when you come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this you throw work to the winds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{knew how}} to do it, I'd like to give five or ten dollars to the child who dances. It must be a tough life, and her mother--the woman at the piano--looks ill. I wonder {{whatever}} brought them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, I seem to {{remember}} your admiring Freddy Dabney because he is so heroically poor. It's very good {{for you to come}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this. Now you know what it's like to be poor, Marky. You can see precisely how romantic it really is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I will, Bill; but you won't {{be able to}} {{see much}} of me. I shall have <b>to</b> get <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> the last. The man I was with said he would take me back again if I wanted to come, and you know I am all day in the shop or going out with parcels, and of course you would have to be busy too at something." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} arises {{because many}} {{people are willing to}} accept lower earnings and higher costs of living <b>to</b> live in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Hawaii, California, Florida, Colorado, the Okanagan region of British Columbia, or other <b>places</b> with <b>an</b> attractive climate.|$|R
5000|$|Okogie {{has been}} {{critical}} of American culture, especially {{as it relates to}} priestly vocations. He said “those people there, in the US, they don’t value anything any more. And how do you want priests <b>to</b> come from <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In all our trabels we's nebber come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> dat. It {{looks like}} de fag end ob creation.

6000|$|Vane disregarded the ironical question. [...] "She's Irish; that {{accounts}} for a good deal." [...] He paused and looked thoughtful. [...] "If I {{knew how to do}} it, I'd like to give the child who dances five dollars. It must be a tough life, and her mother--the woman at the piano--looks ill. I wonder why they came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Between ourselves, Dr Macphail, I don't {{say that}} I {{have formed a}} very {{favourable}} opinion of Mr Davidson, but I am bound to confess that he was within his rights in pointing out to me the danger {{that the presence of}} a woman of Miss Thompson's character was <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this where a number of enlisted men are stationed among a native population." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But she {{was better}} {{about it than}} I,' said Gillian; 'mamma, your trusting me in that way {{is better than a}} dozen balls. Besides, I know I should hate being there without you; I'm a great old thing, as Jasper says, neither fish nor fowl, you know, not come out, and not a little girl in the schoolroom, and it would be very horrid going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> grand <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that on one's own account.' ...|$|R
50|$|Automah: Automh {{province}} {{is located}} 16 kilometers to southwest of Dhamar city and far about 155 km {{to the southwest}} of Sana’a. Automah is rich in the tourist components, which is infrequently <b>to</b> find such <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this area subsequently, since it is declared as a protected natural area.|$|R
6000|$|Tom gave a great sigh. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "if I must, I must; I don't {{mind the}} part of it that you do. I only hate the name of it, and the being tied down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> country <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that, while you go out {{thousands}} of miles off to these savages; {{but if it is}} the only thing to content you, I wont stand in your way. I can't bear your looking disconsolate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{really ought}} to pay, Uncle," [...] {{declared}} Patsy, somewhat nettled by this flaccid reception of her pet scheme. [...] "All the children will insist on being taken <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that, for we shall show just the pictures they love to see. And, allowing {{there is no money}} to be made from the venture, think of the joy we shall give to innumerable little ones!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a {{beautiful}} sight, Gershom, and it almost makes me your friend! The man for whom a woman can feel so much concern--that a woman--nay, women; for you tell me your sister {{is one of the}} family- -but the man whom DECENT women can follow <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this, must have some good p'ints about him. That woman is a-weepin'; and it must be for joy at your return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or {{is there}} {{a girl in the}} case?" [...] he wrote. [...] "There must be, to tie you down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Lindsay for a year. Take care, master Eric; you've been too {{sensible}} all your life. A man is bound to make a fool of himself at least once, and when you didn't get through with that in your teens it may be attacking you now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{no doubt}} of it. Really, I'm not being funny, Miss Wetherford, when I say you've done {{something}} heroic. It's no easy thing <b>to</b> come into <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that and make it habitable. It shows immense courage and self-reliance on your part. It's {{precisely the kind of}} work this whole country needs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It must be mighty nice to {{have money}} enough <b>to</b> live in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] Seth said to himself. [...] "It would please Snip {{way down to the}} ground; but I mustn't think of it, 'cause there's no chance for a feller like me <b>to</b> earn <b>a</b> livin' here, an' we can't always count on folks givin' us what we need to eat." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} the tower {{received}} {{a fair share of}} criticism. [...] According to Cesar Pelli, the most damaging criticism came from Prince Charles, who said on national television, [...] "I personally would go mad if I had <b>to</b> work in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that". [...] Other criticisms came from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said that the building was [...] "not quite stunning".|$|R
