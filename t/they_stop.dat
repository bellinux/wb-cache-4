5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> {{the growth and}} reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in the ribosome. Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, linezolid appears {{to work on the}} first step of {{protein synthesis}}, initiation, unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit elongation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Taliban, Laila and Tariq return to Afghanistan. <b>They</b> <b>stop</b> in the village where Mariam was raised, and {{discover}} a package that Mariam's father left behind for her: a videotape of Pinocchio, a small sack of money, and a letter. Laila reads the letter and discovers that Jalil had regretted sending Mariam away. Laila and Tariq return to Kabul and use the money to fix up the orphanage, where Laila starts working as a teacher. Laila is pregnant with her third child, and if it is a girl, Laila has already named her Mariam.|$|E

5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the airport}} bar, Brian gets very drunk and, when Stewie comes to {{retrieve}} him, their plane tickets are stolen. <b>They</b> <b>stop</b> at a rundown motel, where Stewie tries calling home, but fails {{because he believes}} his phone number is 867-5309. The next day, they have to escape and hotwire a car because their credit card was rejected. To get home, Stewie and Brian masquerade as crop dusters to steal a plane, which they immediately destroy.|$|E
5|$|With Poland being {{a member}} of the Soviet Bloc, the party's pursuits of power and reform were {{permanently}} hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, acutely conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction). Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.|$|E

5|$|After {{watching}} Greg for hours, Leslie and Dave {{decide to}} go to Ann's party. <b>They</b> <b>stop</b> at the parks department to get Leslie's costume, {{only to find the}} office has been toilet papered and vandalized. Leslie immediately suspects Greg, even though they had been watching him all night. Dave reluctantly agrees to bring Greg in for questioning, but Greg insists he is innocent. Andy comes in and questions Greg, pretending to be an FBI agent named Burt Macklin, but Greg is so mean to him Andy soon starts crying. Greg's mother eventually arrives and takes him away after threatening to report the trio for holding her son without proof of his guilt.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When <b>they</b> <b>stop,</b> Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E
5|$|For over 62 years CMLL {{controlled}} NWA World Middleweight Championship, {{even after}} leaving the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in the late 1980s. Up until 2010 the NWA more or less ignored CMLL's use of the championship, but in March 2010 Blue Demon Jr., {{the president of the}} newly formed NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, demanding that <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> promoting the NWA-branded championships since they were not part of the organization. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship belt and named Averno, the final CMLL-recognized NWA World Middleweight Champion, as the inaugural champion.|$|E

5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a single lane of traffic: they move forward at a constant speed if there is open space in front of them, and otherwise <b>they</b> <b>stop.</b> Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of open road when traffic is light, and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E
5|$|Mercyful Fate was {{originally}} formed in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1981, following {{the dissolution of}} the band Brats. Brats had been a punk/metal band, featuring future Mercyful Fate members, vocalist King Diamond, and guitarists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner. After two studio albums and several line-up changes (including the addition of Diamond and the departure of Denner), Diamond and Shermann began writing new material that was much heavier than any of Brats' previous work. The band's record label CBS was not pleased with the material, and demanded <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> singing in English and become more commercial. As a result, Diamond and Shermann quit the group and went on to form Mercyful Fate. After several line-up changes and semi-professional demo tapes, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982. This line-up, consisting of King Diamond, Hank Shermann, bassist Timi Hansen, drummer Kim Ruzz and guitarist Michael Denner, would go on to record the group's first two studio albums.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E

5|$|Outraged by his wife's escapades and the mayor's {{threat of}} {{personal}} violence, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court and revokes Delta's charter. To take their minds off this action, Otter, Boon, Flounder, and Pinto go {{on a road}} trip. Otter is successful in picking up four young women from Emily Dickinson College as dates {{for himself and his}} Delta brothers. He elicits sympathy by posing as the fiancé of a young woman at the college who died in a recent kiln explosion. <b>They</b> <b>stop</b> at a roadhouse bar where Day's band is performing, not realizing it has an exclusively African-American clientele. A couple of hulking patrons intimidate the Deltas and they quickly exit, smashing up Flounder's borrowed car and leaving their dates behind.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. <b>They</b> <b>stop</b> often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her {{paraplegic}} brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), {{travel with}} three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), {{to visit the}} grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. <b>They</b> <b>stop</b> at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E

5|$|The credits appear over a {{flashback}} to a Christmas dinner {{where all the}} Scoobies are present, having a typical lighthearted conversation as Joyce and Buffy discuss a pie that drops on the floor. The scene snaps back to Buffy in the living room, shaking Joyce and screaming at her. She calls for an ambulance and attempts CPR, accidentally snapping a rib in the process, but to no avail. Buffy calls Giles. The paramedics arrive and work on Joyce and she revives, the paramedics declare it a miracle in the ambulance, and Joyce, Buffy, and Dawn rejoice in the hospital. The scene snaps back {{to the living room}} where the paramedics continue to work on Joyce until <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> and tell Buffy that Joyce is dead. They leave, and Buffy goes into the hall and vomits. Giles arrives and Buffy tells him not to move the body, shocking herself by using that word.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, <b>they</b> <b>stop</b> flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|E
