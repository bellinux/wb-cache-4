5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was then}} {{elected to the}} state Senate and served from 1832 to 1835. He {{was a member of}} the Committee for Internal Improvements. Upon the death of Governor John Breathitt in 1834, Lieutenant Governor James Turner Morehead was {{elevated}} to governor. The office of lieutenant governor then being empty, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> no presiding officer. In 1835, Clark was elected Speaker of the Senate, and presided in Morehead's absence.|$|E
5|$|In AD 39, {{relations}} between Caligula and the Roman Senate deteriorated. The subject of their disagreement is unknown. A number of factors, though, aggravated this feud. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> {{become accustomed to}} ruling without an emperor between the departure of Tiberius for Capri in AD 26 and Caligula's accession. Additionally, Tiberius's treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as Asinius Gallus.|$|E

5|$|News of Nero's death reached Vespasian {{as he was}} {{preparing}} to besiege the city of Jerusalem. Almost simultaneously <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> declared Galba, then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The Senate still {{controlled}} North Africa, {{an important}} regional producer of grain, {{as well as}} Illyria and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions. However, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions {{under the control of}} Augustus, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of direct election for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the Populist Party incorporated the direct election of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892. In 1908, Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska. Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non-binding primaries for Senate candidates, in which the candidates would be voted on by the public, effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote; reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method.|$|E
50|$|United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The US signed (16 Feb 1995) but <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>has</b> not {{ratified}} {{because of}} states' rights to execute children (minors tried as adults).

5|$|Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was {{accepted}} by the Senate for two reasons: {{for the removal of}} Caracalla, and for having received the loyalty of the army. The senators were less concerned by Macrinus' Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian social background and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion of him was reduced by his decisions to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked down upon.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine state, {{the emperor}} {{was the sole}} and {{absolute}} ruler, and his power was regarded as having divine origin. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> ceased to have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members. By {{the end of the}} 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of sakellarios is related to this change). The most important administrative reform, which probably started in the mid-7th century, was the creation of themes, where civil and military administration was exercised by one person, the strategos.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of parliamentary committees is mentioned in section 49 of the Constitution of Australia, which makes reference to 'The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate {{and of the}} House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House...' However, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> few committees, engaged in limited activities, until 1970. A number of domestic committees had operated since {{the establishment of the}} parliament, but prior to 1970 the only significant committee to be established was the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in 1932, one of the legislative scrutiny committees (see below).|$|E

5|$|To the north, Stefan Crnojević did {{not keep}} {{relations}} with Alfonso. Instead, he allied himself with Venice which gave him the Flag of St. Marc to bear. Crnojević thus became a Venetian vassal, who promised to protect Albania Veneta from Serbian and Turkish attacks. Skanderbeg grew agitated from the Venetian subtleties and threatened a renewed war against Venice under the pretext that <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> not been annually paying the 1,400 ducats promised to the Albanian in 1448. He had already moved his men towards Durazzo and Scutari, leaving the Republic with {{no choice but to}} ease their secretive diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in 2001, Bush stated his {{opposition}} to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the world's population and would have cost {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year. He also cited that <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.|$|E
5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium before <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew the proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|Keating {{had earlier}} taken several {{measures}} to oppose Gray and the FHLBB, including recruiting {{a study from}} then-private economist Alan Greenspan saying that direct investments were not harmful, and getting President Ronald Reagan to make a recess appointment of a Keating ally, Atlanta real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to an open seat on the FHLBB. By March 1987, however, Henkel had resigned, upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> changed control from Republican to Democratic during the 1986 Congressional elections, placing several Democratic senators in key positions, and starting in January 1987, Keating's staff was putting pressure on Cranston to remove Gray from any FHLBB discussion regarding Lincoln. The following month, Keating began large-scale contributions into Cranston's project to increase California voter registration. In February 1987, Keating met with Riegle and began contributing to Riegle's 1988 re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had a Republican majority for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>had</b> to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E
