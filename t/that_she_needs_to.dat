5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied.

5|$|In Madame Satan (1930), {{adultery}} {{is explicitly}} condoned {{and used as}} a sign for a wife <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest. In Secrets (1933), a husband admits to serial adultery, only this time he repents and the marriage is saved. The films took aim at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers. Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, {{the final year of}} the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation. Consequently, female characters, such as Ruth Chatterton's in Female, live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.|$|E
