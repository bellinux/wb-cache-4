5|$|Railroads {{have played}} an {{important}} role in South Dakota transportation since <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century. Some 4,420miles (7,113km) of railroad track were built in South Dakota during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but only 1,839miles (2,959km) of railroad are currently operational.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} this effort led the Tamils to think {{confidently}} of themselves as a community and prepared the way for their awareness of a common cultural, religious and linguisitic kinship in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|She {{published}} articles and books {{on her work}} and her lobbying {{was instrumental in the}} passage of several educational acts in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century. She was the first woman to have a paper published by the Statistical Society of London. She addressed many conferences and meetings and became {{known as one of the}} foremost public speakers of her time. Carpenter was active in the anti-slavery movement; she also visited India, visiting schools and prisons and working to improve female education, establish reformatory schools and improve prison conditions. In later years she visited Europe and America, carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform.|$|E

50|$|Henry Cooke, one of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century Byrne settlers, {{named the}} South African coastal village after {{the town of}} Kelso on the Tweed River in Scotland. Before modern transportation, the village of Kelso served as an important link in the transportation of sugar. Vessels launched on the Umzinto River could take their cargo out to the larger ships anchored at sea, off the river mouth.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} eighteenth century and towards <b>the</b> early and <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, when music of {{different}} 'Gharanas' were gradually assimilating around the Khayal style, the Dhrupad style continued flourishing among the musicians of Bishnupur.|$|R
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The {{anniversary of}} the Restoration (which was also Charles's birthday)—29 May—was {{recognised}} in England until <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century as Oak Apple Day, after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out. Charles II is commemorated by statues in London's Soho Square, in Edinburgh's Parliament Square, in St Mary's Square in Gloucester, and near the south portal of Lichfield Cathedral, and is depicted extensively in literature and other media. Charleston, South Carolina, and South Kingstown, Rhode Island, are named after him.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was {{the mainstay}} of the economy {{of this part of}} Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales, and nowadays, tourism is the main source of income in Clwyd.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} filmmakers {{involved}} were exiles from the Russian Revolution of 1917. The film's art direction was by Eduardo Gosch, César Lacca, Alexandre Lochakoff, Vladimir Meingard and Pierre Schild who recreated <b>the</b> atmosphere of <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century Tsarist Russia.|$|R
50|$|The {{euphonia}} was {{a talking}} machine created in <b>the</b> early to <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century by <b>the</b> Austrian inventor Joseph Faber and exhibited in 1845 in Philadelphia and in 1846 in London. An {{earlier version of}} the invention had been destroyed in 1844 by Faber.|$|R
50|$|The film, {{in all of}} its wild transformations, is {{a direct}} tribute to the by-then {{forgotten}} Incoherent movement. The title is a reference to <b>the</b> fantasmograph, a <b>mid-Nineteenth</b> Century variant of the magic lantern that projected ghostly images that floated across the walls.|$|R
5|$|Already before this, in 1430, FitzAlan had {{departed}} for France, where {{he held a}} series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. FitzAlan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot in the foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury. His final resting place was a matter of dispute until <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, when his tomb at Arundel Castle was revealed to contain a skeleton missing one leg.|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E
5|$|In poor {{condition}} in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, the nave walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans {{were made by}} William Butterfield. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867–84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages {{at a cost of}} £8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of the reconstruction of the nave, the lifting and paving of the chancel, {{the construction of a new}} altar and the reconstruction of the north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.|$|E
25|$|Accident {{services}} were already provided by workmen's compensation plans, railway companies, and municipalities in Europe and the United States by <b>the</b> late <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, but <b>the</b> first specialized trauma care {{center in the}} world was opened in 1911 in the United States at the University of Louisville Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, and was developed by surgeon Arnold Griswold during the 1930s. Griswold also equipped police and fire vehicles with medical supplies and trained officers to give emergency care while en route to the hospital.|$|R
50|$|In 1949-1950, the Senate Chamber {{underwent}} a reconstruction {{that involved the}} removal of the skylight and a redesign of the room's walls. In place of the chamber's original cast-iron pilasters, newer red Levanto marble pilasters were installed. The wooden rostrum was replaced with a newer, larger version made of marble. The iron and glass ceiling, including the skylight, was replaced with a ceiling of stainless steel and plaster. This redesign, in addition to improving the acoustic properties of the room, was to update <b>the</b> room's <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century decor, which was then out of date.|$|R
50|$|Once the Central American republics became {{independent}} in <b>the</b> early to <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, they had less power {{in relation to}} other nations than did Spain, and struggled to protect their own territorial interests against the more powerful Great Britain and the United States, which took an increasing strategic interest in the area.|$|R
5|$|In {{the land}} {{adjacent}} to Carthy's Castle is Orlagh House {{which has been}} owned by the Augustinian Order since <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century and is a retreat and conference centre run by the friars. It was built in 1790 by Mr Lundy Foot, a wealthy snuff merchant, who named the house Footmount. He was also a magistrate and was instrumental in condemning {{three members of the}} Kearney family to death for the murder of John Kinlan, the gamekeeper at Friarstown, near Bohernabreena, in 1816. Foot was subsequently murdered in 1835, an act that was attributed to relatives of the Kearneys. In fact, Foot was killed by James Murphy, the son of an evicted tenant farmer whose land Foot had bought following the eviction.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive {{the principles of the}} Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh coal {{industry}} employed 1,500 workers in 1800; {{and as the}} industry expanded, the workforce rose to 30,000 by 1864, and to 250,000 by 1913. As employment became available, many people moved {{to the area of}} the South Wales Coalfield; between 1851 and 1911 the population increased by 320,000. By 1913 the Welsh collieries were extracting 56.8million long tons of coal (63.6million short tons) a year, up from 8.5million long tons (9.5million short tons) in 1854; collieries in the region mined a fifth of all coal produced in the UK, and employed a fifth of its miners in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century. In 1913 Britain was responsible for 25 per cent of world coal production and 55 percent of all world coal exports.|$|E
50|$|During the Spanish War of Independence, on July 10, 1810, {{the town}} was taken by French General Régis Barthélemy Mouton-Duvernet, but {{with the fall of}} the ancien regime, it became a {{constitutional}} municipality of the region of Castilla la Vieja. The 1842 census recorded 484 households and 2400 residents in Almazán. In <b>the</b> 1850s, <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, <b>the</b> population grew significantly after Fuentelcarro and Tejerizas were merged into the municipality. In the 1981 census, the population again grew markedly after the incorporation of Cobertelada into the municipality, with the localities of Almántiga, Balluncar, Covarrubias and Lodares del Monte.|$|R
50|$|The film {{is based}} on <b>the</b> {{experiences}} of <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century frontier police officer Henry Heath, who finds out that someone has been systematically robbing the graves in the town cemetery, where his own young daughter is buried. In dealing with the criminal, Heath {{has to look at}} his own beliefs about justice and redemption.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> {{early and}} <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century <b>the</b> first Lao Sung {{including}} the Hmong, Mien, Yao and other Sino-Tibetan groups began settling {{in the higher}} elevations of Phongsali province and northeast Laos. The influx of immigration was facilitated by the same political weakness which had given shelter to the Haw bandits and left large depopulated areas throughout Laos.|$|R
5|$|The museum's {{earliest}} collections {{began to}} coalesce in 1836 {{through the work}} of Lewis C. Beck (1798–1853), a physician, botanist, entomologist, chemist and geologist, who taught at Rutgers in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century from 1830 {{until his death in}} 1853. Many of the exhibits feature items that are unique to New Jersey, including Native American artifacts, minerals, and fossils. These exhibits include a set of fossilized dinosaur tracks believed to belong to the carnivorous Grallator, from the Jurassic-period discovered near Towaco in Morris County, and the skeleton of a 10,000-year old mastodon (Mammut americanum) discovered in Salem County in 1869. The mastodon, found in a marl pit near Mannington, was sold by a local farmer to a travelling circus before it was acquired by Rutgers for display.|$|E
5|$|Trade in {{the region}} was {{negatively}} impacted {{by the development of}} an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center. In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya's port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the dilapidation of Alanya's suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, as it is today. During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility, and civil construction continued under the local dynastic Karamanid authorities. Bandits again became common across Antalya Province in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{increase}} in coin collecting among the public in <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> century, there arose considerable demand for older American coins. Mint Director James Ross Snowden began selling restrikes of Gobrecht dollars and trading them for rare medals (especially those depicting or relating to former President George Washington), which were then added to the Mint's coin collection, then known as a coin cabinet. The money generated from selling the restrikes went toward purchasing new items for the coin cabinet. The restrikes created under Snowden's tenure were likely struck in 1859 and 1860, but the practice was largely halted after the eruption of a public scandal; other Mint employees were creating and selling restrikes of early American coins for their own profit. All Gobrecht dollar restrikes, when tilted on their axis, depict the reverse eagle flying level, rather than upward as it is depicted on the coins struck during the official production run. It is unknown precisely why {{the orientation of the}} eagle was altered, though it is believed by many numismatists that Snowden did this intentionally to make restrikes distinguishable from originals. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggests that Snowden simply used the alignment because that was the same used on the Flying Eagle cent, which began production in 1856. Mint Engraver James B. Longacre, its designer, had borrowed Gobrecht and Peale's eagle reverse for the one-cent coin's obverse.|$|E

50|$|The Pahaquarry Copper Mine is an {{abandoned}} copper mine {{located on the}} west side of Kittatinny Mountain presently in Hardwick Township in Warren County, New Jersey in the United States. Active mining was attempted for brief periods during <b>the</b> mid-eighteenth, <b>mid-nineteenth,</b> and early twentieth centuries but was never successful despite developments in mining technology and improving mineral extraction methods. Such ventures were not profitable as the ore extracted proved to be of too low a concentration of copper.
