5|$|<b>Threefold</b> {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by <b>threefold</b> repetition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{carry out}} a {{systematic}} analysis of Calabi-Yau <b>threefolds</b> that are elliptically fibered with section (“EFS”) and have a large Hodge number h 2, 1. EFS Calabi-Yau <b>threefolds</b> live in a single connected space, with regions of moduli space associated with different topolo-gies connected through transitions that can {{be understood in terms}} of singular Weierstrass models. We determine the complete set of such <b>threefolds</b> that have h 2, 1 ≥ 350 by tuning co-efficients in Weierstrass models over Hirzebruch surfaces. The resulting set of Hodge numbers includes those of all known Calabi-Yau <b>threefolds</b> with h 2, 1 ≥ 350, as well as three appar-ently new Calabi-Yau <b>threefolds.</b> We speculate that there are no other Calabi-Yau <b>threefolds</b> (elliptically fibered or not) with Hodge numbers that exceed this bound. We summarize the theoretical and practical obstacles to a complete enumeration of all possible EFS Calabi-Yau <b>threefolds</b> and fourfolds, including those with small Hodge numbers, using this approach. ar X i...|$|R

5|$|The {{possibility}} of an en passant capture is relevant to claims of a draw by <b>threefold</b> repetition. Two positions whose pieces are {{all on the same}} squares, with the same player to move, are for this purpose considered different if there was an opportunity to make an enpassant capture in the first position, and of course that opportunity no longer exists the second time the same configuration of pieces occurs.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the most {{detailed}} account of the division, describing it as <b>threefold.</b> Olaf the Swede received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, his son in law, to hold as a vassal. Svein Forkbeard gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland {{and a part of}} Trondheim.

Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases.

5|$|Also around 1995, Kontsevich {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a quintic <b>threefold,</b> and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, Alexander Givental posted a paper that claimed to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, so there were doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent proof {{in a series of}} papers. Despite controversy over who had published the first proof, these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical proof of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry.

5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the <b>threefold</b> size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large woodcut with <b>threefold</b> rotational symmetry called Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings.

Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern scientific method.
