5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, {{he learned}} to fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days</b> per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days</b> at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke {{that he might be}} obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days,</b> as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeated}} army suffered greatly, {{not only}} from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water: before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too much water from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days,</b> the Byzantines, not aware that the enemy commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the process, up to a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days</b> may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43b is a dense Hot Jupiter {{with a mass}} of 1.78 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter, but a radius of 0.93 times that of Jupiter's. The planet orbits its host star at a mean {{distance}} of 0.0142 AU every 0.813475 days (19.5234 hours); this orbital period, {{at the time of}} WASP-43b's discovery, was the second-shortest orbit yet detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In addition, WASP-43b had the closest orbit to its host star (among Hot Jupiters) {{at the time of its}} discovery, comparable only to the Super-Earth planet GJ 1214b and to the planetary candidate orbiting KOI-961. While Hot Jupiters are known to have small orbital periods, planets with exceptionally small periods below <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days</b> are extremely rare; however, in the case of WASP-43b, the planet's proximity can be explained because its host star has a very low mass. The rarity of systems like that of WASP-43 and its planet suggest that Hot Jupiters do not usually occur around low-mass stars, or that such planets cannot maintain stable orbits around such stars.|$|E
5000|$|If {{audit fees}} {{are too high}} they will price the product out of the market, {{and if they are}} too low, it is not {{possible}} to do the audit specified, and the guarantee becomes meaningless. There are complaints that the Fairtrade audit and certification fees are so high that the cooperatives may receive little money after paying them. There are also concerns that the money paid for the audit in producing countries covers <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>day's</b> work [...] which is not enough to do any meaningful audit of the accounts, let alone the large number of criteria on the labour, governance, pesticide, and so on.|$|R

40|$|A repeated-measures {{experiment}} design including two between-unit factors and one within-unit factor {{was performed in}} order to examine the influence of gibberellic acid on cherry fruit quality. One of the two between-unit factors had two levels represented by two cherry cultivars ('Van', 'Sunburst') and the other consisted of two treatments: spraying with gibberellic acid and spraying with pure water as a control. An experimental unit was a cherry branch on which 20 cherries were sampled randomly and marked. The three variables which describe ripeness of cherries were measured over 6 time points at <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>day</b> intervals during maturation. After picking the cherries, measurements of fruit firmness were made on 3 different sides of each marked cherry. The univariate and multivariate repeated measures ANOVA was used for the analysis of two sets of data. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{consequences}} {{for the people of}} Liverpool were far greater than those in the capital.

25|$|Capello's {{link with}} United {{eventually}} came to nothing after Ferguson abandoned {{his decision to}} retire and signed a new contract, with Martin Edwards claiming that United had been <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days</b> away from appointing a new manager, believed to be Capello, when Ferguson changed his mind. The 2001–02 season developed into a battle between Roma and Juventus.

25|$|People {{come from}} all over Israel and many other nations for the annual dance festival in Karmiel, held in July. First held in 1987, the Karmiel Dance Festival is the largest celebration of dance in Israel, {{featuring}} <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days</b> and nights of dancing with 5,000 or more dancers and {{a quarter of a million}} spectators in the capital of the Galilee. Begun as an Israeli folk dance event, the festivities now include performances, workshops, and open dance sessions for a variety of dance forms and nationalities. Choreographer Yonatan Karmon created the Karmiel Dance Festival to continue the tradition of Gurit Kadman's Dalia Festival of Israeli dance, which ended in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Sensory and {{sensorimotor}} disturbances when {{arriving in}} low Earth orbit are well documented, the most known of these being space motion sickness (SMS). Individual differences, spacecraft size, and body movements cause SMS symptoms. Typically lasting the first <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>days</b> of weightlessness, symptoms range from headaches and fatigue to nausea and vomiting. The consequences vary from simple discomfort to possible incapacitation, creating potential problems during extra-vehicular activity, re-entry, and emergency egress from the spacecraft. The body receives {{a variety of}} conflicting signals from the visual, somato-sensory, and vestibular organs in weightlessness. These conflicting inputs {{are thought to be}} the primary cause of SMS, but the precise mechanisms of the conflict are not well understood. Medications currently used to alleviate the symptoms produce undesirable side effects.|$|E
