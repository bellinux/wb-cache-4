25|$|In 1995, Finch and Morgan-McClure {{decided to}} resurrect the No. 4 Kodak Busch Series car. Purvis would drive {{the car in}} nine races, the most starts in a season to date.

2500|$|In January 1933 monthly talks by Ford {{began with}} a {{regional}} conference of five communities held in Yonkers, New York.

60|$|The miner glanced {{round at}} the heap of ore which betrayed his craft, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the dark, bearded, impassive face.|$|E
60|$|Sitka Charley {{looked at}} me in swift surprise, <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the picture. It was evident {{that he had not}} {{reasoned}} the impression.|$|E

50|$|A British {{merchant}} ship is torpedoed by a German U-Boat and takes shelter {{in a neutral}} port. The Captain <b>then</b> strikes <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the German enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "And ugly. Don't forget that--and ugly. Look {{where you}} like. Look near you, here abroad where you are, and <b>then</b> look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> home, whence you came." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{threw back}} the curtain {{and took his}} arm. The table was laid for two. He looked at it in bewilderment and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{opened the}} door curiously, stared over Father's head at Mother, <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the little man with his pink, cheery face and whiff of {{delicate}} silver hair.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dixon {{tried to}} speak, but 'er temper {{was too much}} for 'er. She looked from her 'usband to Charlie and Bob and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 'im agin and caught 'er breath.|$|E
60|$|Addressed thus directly, {{the manager}} allowed {{his gaze to}} wander from the ceiling. He eyed Psmith for a moment like an elderly basilisk, <b>then</b> looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling again.|$|R
60|$|Mr Willet looked {{first at}} her, then <b>at</b> his son, <b>then</b> <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> Dolly, {{and then made}} an ineffectual effort to extract a whiff from his pipe, which had gone out long ago.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked away}} at Giovanelli, who was decorating {{himself with his}} almond blossom. <b>Then</b> looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Winterbourne, [...] "I shouldn't think you would let people be so unkind!" [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|He departed, {{closing the}} door behind him. Francis held out his hands to Margaret. She rose slowly to her feet, looked in the glass helplessly and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. She was very {{beautiful}} but a little dazed.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{mind was}} evidently {{occupied}} with watching Rollo. She looked {{first at the}} rock and island, where Mr. Holiday was pointing, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Rollo, until at length Mr. Holiday, perceiving that her mind was disturbed by Rollo's motions, said to him, ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{looked at}} each other, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the closed door. “That man can {{scarcely}} hobble, and his hands are tied,” said one. “Go back and rattle at the lock, and he will {{think it is the}} key. Then if you are quick you may find Tomasa while I tell the Alcalde.” ...|$|E
50|$|In March 1993, {{in order}} to switch from 89.1 to 91.9 and reduce {{interference}} to WECT, WFSS signed off for five days and <b>then</b> came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 30,000 watts before finally going back to 100,000 watts.|$|R

50|$|However, Silke bit {{off more}} than he could chew. Kingpin survived the {{assassination}} attempt and was carried out of the country by Vanessa Fisk, his wife. Vanessa <b>then</b> got <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Silke's men, having them killed and killing Richard herself.|$|R
60|$|His friend {{stared at}} him aghast, but made no movement. He looked at the {{unconscious}} Poppy, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the mouthing figure seated on the scuttle. His brain was numbed. Then a little performance on Charlie’s part {{a week or two}} before, which had cost that gentleman his berth, occurred to him, and he moved slowly forward.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that they}} were where the scheme could be carried into execution, Carrots {{was by no means}} {{confident}} it would be a success, and actually felt rather timid about making the attempt; but, urged on by Teenie, he finally mustered up courage to open the door of the office. He stood on the threshold, gazing first at the attorney and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> his friend.|$|E
60|$|A little {{spiral of}} curling smoke rose from {{one corner of}} the pyre--the flames licked upward, crackling. La stood there like a {{beautiful}} statue of despair gazing at Tarzan and at the spreading flames. In a moment they would reach out and grasp him. From the tangled forest came the sound of cracking limbs and crashing trunks--Tantor was coming down upon them, a huge Juggernaut of the jungle. The priests were becoming uneasy. They cast apprehensive glances {{in the direction of the}} approaching elephant and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> La.|$|E
6000|$|For {{all this}} island's creature-full, [...] (Kept happy not by halves) [...] Mild cows, {{that at the}} vine-wreaths pull, [...] <b>Then</b> low <b>back</b> <b>at</b> their calves [...] With tender lowings, to approve [...] The warm mouths milking them for love.|$|R
60|$|The blow {{from the}} bully angered Tom greatly, and skating forward {{he made a}} pass at Koswell. But the latter ducked, and <b>then</b> came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Tom with a blow that sent the fun-loving Rover into several {{students}} standing by.|$|R
60|$|Arthur Inglewood glanced curiously for {{an instant}} at the huge {{creature}} {{at the foot of}} the table, who was fitting a paper figure with a cocked hat, and <b>then</b> looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Dr. Pym, who was concluding in a quieter tone.|$|R
60|$|Next {{they turned}} to the {{business}} table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor's hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, {{to serve as a}} testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hoy shook hands,--Benyon {{gave him}} his before he knew it,--said he was very happy, smiled, looked at Benyon from head to foot, then at Georgina, then round the room, <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Benyon again,--at Benyon, who stood there, without sound or movement, with a dilated eye, and a pulse quickened to a degree of which Mr. Roy could have little idea. Georgina made some remark about their sitting down, but William Roy replied {{that he had n't}} time for that,--if Captain Benyon would excuse him. He should have to go {{straight}} into the library, and write a note to send back to his office, where, as he just remembered, he had neglected to give, in leaving the place, an important direction.|$|E
60|$|Her {{husband was}} pleased that she should remain so long before them. And for a while, as she stood lost in contemplation, he did not speak. Once she glanced at him, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the stern face of the General,--stern, yet kindly. The eyes, deep-set under bushy brows, like Hugh's, were full of fire; and yet the artist had made them human, too. A dark, reddish brown, close-trimmed {{mustache}} and beard hid the mouth and chin. Hugh had inherited the nose, but the father's forehead was wider and fuller. Hugh was at once a newer type, and an older. The face and figure of the General were characteristic of the mid-century American of the northern states, a mixture of boldness and caution and Puritanism, who had won his battles in war and commerce by a certain native quality of mind.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} his residency, Fallon {{spent six years}} practicing emergency medicine, first in the Atlanta, Georgia area, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> in Denver <b>at</b> Exempla Lutheran emergency group.|$|R
60|$|He laughed. It was {{absurd to}} admit it, but nothing had pleased {{him so much}} since the coming of his misfortune! She was {{thoughtful}} for some time, every now and <b>then</b> glancing <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the newspaper. Over their coffee she broke into a little reminiscent laugh.|$|R
60|$|James Van Teyl glanced curiously at the small, dark figure {{standing}} patiently before him, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> {{the wireless}} cable which he {{held in his}} fingers. He was just back from a tiring day in Wall Street, and was reclining in the most comfortable easy-chair of his Hotel Plaza sitting-room.|$|R
