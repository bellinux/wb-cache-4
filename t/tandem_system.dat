40|$|The {{problem of}} exact {{evaluation}} of the mean service cycle time in <b>tandem</b> <b>systems</b> of single-server queues with both infinite and finite buffers is considered. It is assumed that the interarrival and service times of customers form sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables with known mean values. We start with tandem queues with infinite buffers, and show that under the above assumptions, the mean cycle time exists. Furthermore, if the random variables which represent interarrival and service times have finite variance, the mean cycle time can be calculated as the maximum out from the mean values of these variables. Finally, obtained results are extended to {{evaluation of the}} mean cycle time in particular <b>tandem</b> <b>systems</b> with finite buffers and blocking. Comment: 12 pages.

40|$|Migrating common {{business}} oriented language (Cobol) {{applications from}} HP NonStop <b>Tandem</b> <b>systems</b> to IBM z/OS mainframes requires {{detailed analysis of}} program structuring, variable declaration and keywords and a methodical conversion approach. Executive Summary CIOs facing the rising challenges of higher total cost of operations (TCO) of HP NonStop <b>Tandem</b> <b>systems</b> need to find alternatives. 1 The bulk of applications created for these HP systems use the Cobol programming language. IBM z/OS mainframes provide an alternative with stability and reliability similar to the HP NonStop <b>Tandem</b> <b>systems.</b> However, migrating Cobol applications written for HP Tandem to IBM mainframes is fraught with complexity and is often time-consuming. This white paper delves into recent versions of Cobol on both systems and provides a comprehensive listing of code differences and similarities. The aim is to provide all the relevant information CIOs and application developers need when considering migrating from HP Tandem to the IBM z/OS mainframe. The differences and similarities covered include: • Environment division. • Data division. • Procedure division. Also included is a case study that offers insights into compilation issues found when recompiling an HP Tandem COBOL program on the IBM z/ OS mainframe COBOL Enterprise compiler. The paper concludes by assessing various conversion approaches and tools. Not covered {{is the use of}} Screen COBOL (SCOBOL) language to find differences. The SCO-BOL language on HP Tandem is similar to Cobol and is used to generate graphical user-based interfaces. In addition, we do not tackle embedded SQL programming. Program Organization and Format Figure 1 (on next page) illustrates the difference between the HP Tandem and IBM Cobol reference format. • Program organization and format. • Identification division...|$|R

50|$|The axles used {{in early}} Sisu models were {{produced}} by Timken. Later the axle housings were locally produced. In 1942 SAT started its own axle production; the first models {{were based on}} Timken products and produced in Helsinki. Kirkstall axles were later used in some applications. Soon after Vanajan Autotehdas was merged into SAT in 1968, the outstanding lifting <b>tandem</b> <b>system,</b> used previously in Vanaja lorries, was adopted to Sisu; the robust structure was most welcome because the SAT's own corresponding solution was suffering of fractures. Axle production was moved to Hämeenlinna in 1985 and axle production was split off as a separate company, Sisu Axles, and finally sold to investors in 1999. During the Renault partnership also Renault axles were in selection.|$|E
