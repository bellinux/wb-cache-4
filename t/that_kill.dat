5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, two deadly {{terrorist}} vehicle-based attacks {{occurred in}} Europe: the July attack in Nice, France, <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> 86; and the December attack in Berlin, Germany, <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> 12. This {{was followed by}} four other similar attacks in 2017: one in Jerusalem in January <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> four, one in London in March 2017 <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> three. The Stockholm attack at April 7th killed 5 people. a second attack in London in June <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> three and one in Barcelona in August <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> at least fourteen people. Other terrorist attacks of a similar M.O. have occurred intermittently in Western countries since 2014, though these produced no fatalities.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the shooting, {{there had}} been three attacks in Jerusalem in 2017. A January 8 truck attack <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> four Israeli {{soldiers}} and injured 17, an April 14 stabbing on the Jerusalem Light Rail <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> 1 and injured 2, and a June 16 attack targeting Israeli police <b>that</b> <b>killed</b> one female officer and injured four.|$|R

5|$|Several {{species of}} entomopathogenic {{nematode}} are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective {{stage in the}} soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, {{but it is the}} bacteria <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{bacteria}} kill and then consume other microorganisms, these species are called predatory bacteria. These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> and digest any bacteria they encounter. Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey {{in order to}} digest them and absorb nutrients, such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus, or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol, such as Daptobacter. These predatory bacteria {{are thought to have}} evolved from saprophages that consumed dead microorganisms, through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms.|$|E
5|$|The egg {{parasite}} Trichogramma {{is frequently}} released inundatively to control harmful moths. Similarly, Bacillus thuringiensis and other microbial insecticides {{are used in}} large enough quantities for a rapid effect. Recommended release rates for Trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according {{to the level of}} pest infestation. Similarly, nematodes <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> insects (that are entomopathogenic) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests.|$|E

50|$|This vengeance {{is usually}} {{specifically}} targeted against the tormentor, but {{can sometimes be}} a general hatred toward all living humans. This untargeted wrath {{can be seen in}} Furisode, a story in Hearn's book In Ghostly Japan about a cursed kimono <b>that</b> <b>kills</b> everyone who wears it. This motif is repeated in the film Ring with a videotape <b>that</b> <b>kills</b> all who watch it, and the film Ju-on with a house <b>that</b> <b>kills</b> all who enter it.|$|R
5|$|Dig Me Out is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album Call the Doctor, released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. Call the Doctor confirmed the band's {{reputation as one}} of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of Call the Doctor, drummer Janet Weiss of Quasi joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and current drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill Rock Stars, another independent record label which singer and guitarist Corin Tucker thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked <b>that</b> <b>Kill</b> Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that Call the Doctor only took four days to record while Dig Me Out was recorded over the period of eight days.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{realizes that}} September's message was literal, {{and returns to}} his home, where he is knocked out by Jones' men. He is brought to the same {{facility}} as Olivia and tied up. As they prepare to torture him, Olivia begins to use her powers to activate the lights, {{not only on the}} box but within the facility, creating electrical sparks <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> one of Jones' men. As Jones and Nina retreat, Olivia frees Peter and they give chase, though Olivia suffers from a seizure, following excessive use of her powers. They catch up to Jones and Nina as they are crossing back to the parallel universe, but the two are able to escape. Peter contacts the authorities to bring medical help for Olivia. As they are waiting, Peter admits to Olivia that he fears what he has done to her memories, and has seen his original Olivia through the Observer's mind. He leaves her, believing that staying away from this Olivia would be for the best.|$|E

25|$|Two {{telomerase}} vaccines {{have been}} developed: GRNVAC1 and GV1001. GRNVAC1 isolates dendritic cells and the RNA that codes for the telomerase protein {{and puts them}} back into the patient to make cytotoxic T cells <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> the telomerase-active cells. GV1001 is a peptide from the active site of hTERT and is recognized by the immune system that reacts by killing the telomerase-active cells.|$|E
25|$|Healthy adult mustangs {{have few}} natural predators aside from {{mountain}} lions, {{and to a}} lesser extent, the grizzly bear and the gray wolf. The mountain lion is well known for predation on feral horses, and the larger members of the species may hunt both horses and moose. They are very effective predators <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> by either leaping onto an animal or chasing it down in a sprint, then grabbing the prey with their front claws and biting the neck, either at the windpipe or the spine.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of methyl {{parathion}} and azinphos methyl, citing the risks they pose to children. Both {{methyl parathion}} and azinphos methyl are organophosphates. Organophosphates are pesticides <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides {{have the same}} effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another organophosphate, (chlorpyrifos), that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that chlorpyrifos caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats.|$|E
25|$|Estuaries {{tend to be}} {{naturally}} eutrophic because land-derived nutrients {{are concentrated}} where runoff enters the marine environment in a confined channel. The World Resources Institute has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan. In the ocean, there are frequent red tide algae blooms <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes are {{generally}} grown from seed potatoes â€“ these are tubers specifically grown to be disease free and provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, {{the areas where}} seed potatoes are grown are selected with care. In the USA this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of the 50 states that grow potatoes. These locations are selected for their cold hard winters <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> pests and long sunshine hours in the summer for optimum growth. In the UK, most seed potatoes originate in Scotland in areas where westerly winds prevent aphid attack and thus prevent spread of potato virus pathogens.|$|E

25|$|Wolves were {{generally}} revered by Aboriginal Canadians that survived by hunting, but were thought little of by those that survived through agriculture. Some Alaska Natives including the Nunamiut of both northern and northwestern Alaska respected the wolf's hunting skill {{and tried to}} emulate the wolf in order to hunt successfully. First Nations such as Naskapi as well as Squamish and Lil'wat view the wolf as a daytime hunting guide. The Naskapis believed that the caribou afterlife is guarded by giant wolves <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> careless hunters who venture too near. The Netsilik Inuit and Takanaluk-arnaluk believed that the sea-woman Nuliayuk's home was guarded by wolves. Wolves were feared by the Tsilhqot'in, who believed that contact with wolves would result in nervous illness or death. The Denaâ€™ina believed wolves were once men, and viewed them as brothers.|$|E
25|$|In Statistics of Deadly Quarrels Richardson {{presented}} data {{on virtually}} every war from 1815 to 1945. As a result, he hypothesized a base 10 logarithmic scale for conflicts. In other words, {{there are many}} more small fights, in which only a few people die, than large ones <b>that</b> <b>kill</b> many. While no conflict's size can be predicted beforehandâ€”indeed, it is impossible to give an upper limit to the seriesâ€”overall they do form a Poisson distribution. On a smaller scale he showed the same pattern for gang murders in Chicago and Shanghai. Others have noted that similar statistical patterns occur frequently, whether planned (lotteries, with many more small payoffs than large wins), or by natural organisation (there are more small towns with grocery stores than big cities with superstores).|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{jumped out}} of the {{airplane}} near the base of the airfield control tower and picked up a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) from a Marine who did not need it anymore. A member of the All Navy Pistol Team and a longtime pistol and bird shooter, Arnold was an excellent marksman, and shot down a torpedo plane coming in to strafe the new control tower next to which he was standing. The plane crashed on the field. Between the two waves, Jack and a couple of sailors went over to look at the wreckage. Discovering it belonged to the first waveâ€™s Torpedo Squadron Commander, they drank the downed pilot's sake and returned to the battle. <b>That</b> <b>kill</b> from the ground was later to make Jack the only known pilot who shot down five aircraft (one with a BAR, two with an Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, and two with a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter) who was not an ace.|$|E
