5000|$|Statistics {{show that}} anocracies are {{ten times more}} likely to {{experience}} intrastate conflict <b>than</b> democracies, and <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> autocracies. One explanation for the increase in violence and conflict within anocracies is a theory known as More Murder in the Middle (MMM). The theory argues that the unstable characteristics of anocratic regimes, which include the presence of divided elites, inequality, and violent challengers who threaten the legitimacy of the current social order, cause governing elite to resort to political repression or state terror at a much higher rate than democratic or authoritarian regimes. This leads to high levels of what are termed [...] "life-integrity violations" [...] which include state-sponsored genocide, extrajudicial executions, and torture.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{demographic}} characteristics and risk behaviors for hepatitis B infection among {{injection drug users}} younger than 30 years with those aged 30 or older and to evaluate participants' knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of infection, screening, and vaccination against hepatitis B virus. Design A systematic sample of injection drug users not currently in a treatment program were recruited and interviewed at needle exchange programs and community sites. Participants 135 injection drug users younger than 30 years and 96 injection drug users aged 30 or older. Results Injection drug users younger <b>than</b> 30 were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> drug users aged 30 or older to report having shared needles in the past 30 days (36 / 135 [27 %] vs 12 / 96 [13 %]). Injection drug users younger than 30 were also <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to report having had more than two sexual partners in the past 6 months (80 / 135 [59 %] vs 29 / 96 [30 %]). Although 88 of 135 (68 %) young injection drug users reported having had contact with medical providers within the past 6 months only 13 of 135 (10 %) had completed the hepatitis B vaccine series and only 16 of (13 %) perceived themselves as being {{at high risk of}} becoming infected with the virus. Conclusion Few young injection drug users have been immunized even though they have more frequent contact with medical providers and are at a higher risk for new hepatitis B infection than older drug users. Clinicians caring for young injection drug users and others at high risk of infection should provide education, screening, and vaccination to reduce an important source of hepatitis B infection...|$|R

Design: A prospective descriptive study design with a multicentre observational approach was followed. Method: All patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery, whether elective or emergency, during a three-month period (15 August– 15 November 2005) {{were included in}} the study. Demographic data, pre-operative medical status, intra-operative, as well as post-operative information were collected using a self-designed structured initial assessment form (SIA). Means and standard deviations were calculated where applicable. Relationships between different variables were analyzed by means of: ANOVA, correlations, linear and logistic regressions. Where it appeared that the ANOVA assumptions were violated, non-parametric bootstrap techniques were employed. Results: Two hundred and forty five patients were admitted to the seven hospitals which provide CABG surgery in the Cape metropolitan area in the allotted period. The profile of patients admitted to private and state institutions were similar. The mean age of the sample was 60 (± 10). The mean LOS of the total cohort was 12 (± 5. 5) days, with patients in the state hospitals staying longer 13. 4 days (± 7. 1). Patients who were older <b>than</b> 60 were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to have a LOS > 12 days (odds ratio = 2. 49; 95 % confidence interval = 1. 33 to 4. 65). The development of a pleural effusion or pneumothorax was associated with an increased LOS (p 12 days in the current cohort. Patients were most likely to develop a PPC on day three after CABG surgery. Physiotherapeutic intervention, if any, would be well aimed at those patients older than 60 years of age. Screening of patients in the first three post-operative days for the development of PPCs is also advised...|$|R

25|$|Continuity of supply. The 2015 Impact Report reports {{an average}} supply of 18 hours per day, up from 14 hours in 2006-07. Only in nine mostly small WSPs water is {{provided}} continuously 24 hours per day. In Nairobi water is provided on average for 18 {{hours a day}} and in Mombasa for 6 hours. Nonetheless, instances of water scarcity (defined as more than five days without or with insufficient water supply) still occur in Kenya. In 2006 in Kisumu over 40% of households (both poor and non-poor) connected to water mains reported scarcity. The greatest difference between the poor and non-poor was recorded in Nairobi, where poor households were more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to say they experienced scarcity. A higher percentage of kiosk users reported scarcity than households with mains connections, suggesting that in times of scarcity kiosks are less likely to receive water than domestic connections.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{tested the}} effects of {{exposure}} to different doses of lead acetate (either 0, 25, 100, or 400 ppm) {{on the development of}} aggressive behavior in male golden hamsters. Pups were tested for offensive responses across puberty, as they were maturing from play fighting to adult aggression. Our data show a dose-specific effect of lead exposure on the development of aggression during puberty at doses resulting in blood levels well below 20 mg/dl. Animals exposed to 25 ppm lead acetate were faster and performed more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> many attacks on intruders by late puberty. They were also <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to initiate adult instead of play-fighting attacks around mid-puberty. These observations were independent of any effect on growth.
