Although the driver and his assistant jumped to safety, they rose to see the engine trundling towards a cottage at high speed. Fortunately for the occupants, the steering wheel made contact with an obstacle on the road, causing the engine to veer to the left and collide with a railway bridge, causing damage which is still visible today.|$|R

Keep whatever is pretty in itself, or is illustrative of your every-day life, or that of the savages, in the way of arms, utensils, and dresses. Make careful drawings of your encampment, your retinue, and whatever else you may in indolence have omitted to sketch, that will possess an after-interest.

40|$|This article aims to {{experimentally}} {{determine how}} the tractor’s weight distribution changes during loading by drawbar pull, and how the tractor’s weight affects its drawbar pull properties. Drive wheel ballasting has {{a significant effect on}} the drawbar pull and wheel slip of the tractor - <b>travelling</b> <b>gear</b> losses. To achieve these objectives, we conducted experimental measurements on the tractor Case IH Magnum 370 CVX. The results show that higher drawbar pull is achieved in tractors with a higher weight. The measured increase of drawbar pull was 15, 8 kN between maximal and minimal weight (∆ 2320 kg). All variants show an equal percentage increase in the weight on the rear axle of the tractor (+ 6 %). Increasing the tractor’s weight affected the drawbar pull as well as the wheel slip. As the tractor’s weight increases, there is a smaller increase in wheel slip as the drawbar pull increases. The results confirmed that tractor ballasting is important in order to achieve optimum drawbar pull properties, but it is necessary {{to keep in mind that}} the higher the weight of the machine or equipment, the larger the effect on the soil...|$|R
