40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds on the antioxidative defense system and oxidative stress in rats fed a high fat · high cholesterol diet.

Supplementation of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds groups (HEA, HEB and HEC) resulted in significantly increased activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and catalase.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds powder on lipid metabolism in rats fed high fatㆍhigh cholesterol diet.

Each diet was fed to three replicate batteries of hens with each battery consisting of a row of five cages of hens with two hens per cage (n = 3). In Exp. 2, 180, thirty-wk old, Hyline Brown laying hens, housed similarly to those in Exp. 1, were fed an unsupplemented basal diet as well as treatments in which the basal diet was supplemented with 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed in a laboratory blender to an average particle size of 300 μm, 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill (44 μm) and finally 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill but mixed with 5 % Na 2 CO 3 either before or after grinding. A diet supplemented with 0. 3 ppm carophyll red pigment was also included (n = 3). In both experiments, hens were fed the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder or pigment for 14 days.
