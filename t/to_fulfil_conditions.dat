40|$|This study {{proposes to}} address the issue of the {{effectiveness}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Special and Differential Treatment (S&D) provisions in helping developing countries, in the sense of whether or not the provisions have achieved their ends. To address this issue, the following question will be asked: to what extent have the S&D provisions been effective, both in their implementation in practice by the WTO Members, and in their enforcement in dispute settlement process? Three main legal research methods have been employed for this study, namely ormative and empirical legal studies, and case studies. This study argues that the implementation and enforcement of the S&D provisions have been mostly ineffective. In the implementation, the unenforceability of the S&D provisions has been the most significant contributing factor to their ineffectiveness. In the dispute settlement, factors for the ineffectiveness have been the failure of developing countries <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>conditions</b> required by the S&D provisions; the failure of developing countries to submit adequate prima facie evidence to support their claims or defences; and strict and narrow interpretation of the provisions by panels and the Appellate Body...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} a modular {{approach to the}} design of integrated social surveys. The approach consists of grouping variables into ‘modules’, each of which is then allocated to one or more ‘instruments’. Each instrument is then administered to a random sample of population units, and each sample unit responds to all modules of the instrument. This approach offers a way of designing a system of integrated social surveys that balances the need to limit the cost and the need to obtain sufficient information. The allocation of the modules to instruments draws on the methodology of split questionnaire designs. The composition of the instruments, that is, how the modules are allocated to instruments, and the corresponding sample sizes are obtained as a solution to an optimisation problem. This optimisation involves minimisation of respondent burden and data collection cost, while respecting certain design constraints usually encountered in practice. These constraints may include, for example, the level of precision required and dependencies between the variables. We propose using a random search algorithm to find approximate optimal solutions to this problem. The algorithm is proved <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>conditions</b> that ensure convergence to the global optimum and can also produce an efficient design for a split questionnaire...|$|E

The redimensioning of propulsion system, increasing the number of thrusters and theirs possibilities gives the benefits in dynamic positioning accuracy, but increases the investment costs.

Euler equation branching {{is a type of}} differential inclusion x ̇ ∈ {f(x), g(x) }, where f, g: X ⊂ Rn → Rn are continuous and f(x) 6 = g(x) in every point x ∈ X. Stockman and Raines in [15] defined so-called chaotic set in plane R 2 which existence leads to an existence of Devaney, Li-Yorke and distributional chaos. In this paper, we follow up on [15] and we show that chaos in plane R 2 with two ”classical ” (with non-zero determinant of Jacobi’s matrix) hyperbolic singular points of both branches not lying in the same point in R 2 is always admitted.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the question, whether there is an order barrier p≤ 2 for time {{integration}} in computational elasto-plasticity. In the analysis we use an implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method of order p= 3 for integrating the evolution equations of plastic flow within a nonlinear finite element framework. We show that two novel algorithmic conditions are necessary to overcome the order barrier, (i) total strains must have the same order in time as the time integrator itself, (ii) accurate initial data must be calculated via detecting the elastic-plastic switching point (SP) in the predictor step. Condition (i) is for a consistent coupling of the global boundary value problem (BVP) with the local initial value problems (IVP) via displacements/strains. Condition (ii) generates consistent initial data of the IVPs. The third condition, which is not algorithmic but physical in nature, is that (iii) the total strain path in time must be smooth such that condition (i) can be fulfilled at all. This requirement is met by materials showing a sufficiently smooth elastic-plastic transition in the stress-strain curve. We propose effective means <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>conditions</b> (i) and (ii). We show in finite element simulations that, if condition (iii) is additionally met, the present method yields the full, theoretical convergence order 3 thus overcoming the barrier p≤ 2 for the first time. The observed speed-up for a 3 rd order RK method is considerable compared with Backward Euler...|$|E
