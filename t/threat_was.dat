Alekry said that while walking him, riot police also broke his nose and damaged his left eye so badly in the process that he {{temporarily}} lost his sight. He was then taken to a police bus, where his pants were pulled down by an officer who threatened Alekry with sexual assault; though the <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> not carried out.|$|E
5|$|The Ferdinand <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> {{continued}} until 8 September, {{to support the}} Allied efforts in France and Italy. It was 'A' Force's last major operation, a brief follow up called Braintree was designed but never implemented because the overall Bodyguard strategy had been mothballed in late August.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Night Interception Committee on 2 May it was decided that the bomber <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> greater than submarines, and the {{decision}} was made to move 80 of the 140 ASV Mk. I transmitters to AI, adding to 70 being constructed by EKCO (E.K. Cole). These would be turned into 60 IIIA's and 40 IIIB's. At a further meeting on 23 May, Tizard, perhaps prompted by comments from Director of Signals (Air), suggested that the units were not suitable for operational use, especially due to low reliability, and should be confined to daylight training missions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the updated}} version of the theory, the four {{components}} {{have been reduced to}} two basic types - realistic and symbolic <b>threats.</b> Realistic <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> <b>threats</b> to a group’s power, resources, and general welfare. Symbolic <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> <b>threats</b> to a group’s religion, values, belief system, ideology, philosophy, morality, or worldview.|$|R
50|$|A death <b>threat</b> can <b>be</b> communicated via a {{wide range}} of media, among these letters, {{newspaper}} publications, telephone calls, internet blogs, and e-mail. If the <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> made against a political figure, it can also be considered treason. If a <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> against a non-living location that frequently contains living individuals (e.g. a building), it could <b>be</b> a terrorist <b>threat.</b> Sometimes, death <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> part of a wider campaign of abuse targeting a person or a group of people (see terrorism, mass murder).|$|R

5|$|In the 16th century, the Marsamxett Harbour {{was one of}} the {{two major}} {{harbours}} in the Maltese city of Valletta. In the centre of the harbour was an island, originally known as l'Isolotto and now known as Manoel Island after the fort, which overlooked the city. Shortly after Valletta's construction, the Order of Saint John realised this was a potential vulnerability in the city's defences. As early as 1569, it was proposed that a small fort with a cavalier be built on the Isolotto to prevent the enemy from taking the island and building batteries on it. The <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> again highlighted by the Spanish military engineer Scipione Campi in 1577, and by Giovanni Battista in 1582.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, there were still some intermittent, mainly artillery, attacks from Serb-held areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Dubrovnik area and elsewhere. The {{remaining}} Serb-held area in Croatia, in Eastern Slavonia, was faced {{with the possibility of}} military confrontation with Croatia. Such a possibility was repeatedly stated by Tuđman after Storm. The <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> underlined by the movement of troops to the region in mid-October, as well as a repeat of an earlier threat to intervene militarily—specifically saying that the Croatian Army could intervene if no peace agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers {{with the ability}} to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter this threat, Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets.|$|E
50|$|A death <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> a <b>threat,</b> {{often made}} anonymously, by one {{person or a}} group of people to kill another person or group of people. These <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> often {{designed}} to intimidate victims in order to manipulate their behavior, and thus a death <b>threat</b> can <b>be</b> a form of coercion. For example, a death <b>threat</b> could <b>be</b> used to dissuade a public figure from pursuing a criminal investigation or an advocacy campaign.|$|R

50|$|The main <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> {{habitat loss}} due to urban and {{recreational}} development, afforestation, invasive vegetation, agricultural expansion and chemical pollution.

5|$|Maine {{continued}} to be difficult, with a rebellion by Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine, probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at Sainte-Suzanne by William's forces {{for at least two}} years, but he eventually made his peace with the king and was restored to favour. William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear– he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but may have been in England before then to collect the danegeld assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King Cnut IV of Denmark. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2009, a posting on the 4chan /b/ {{board said}} there would be a school {{shooting}} at St Eskils Gymnasium in Eskilstuna, Sweden, leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated. A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster. Police said that the suspect called it off as a joke, and they released him after they found no indication that the <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> serious.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm Gun M3 was {{the first}} {{dedicated}} anti-tank gun fielded by United States forces in numbers. Introduced in 1940, it became the standard anti-tank gun of the U.S. infantry with its size enabling it to be pulled by a jeep. However, the continuing improvement of German tanks quickly rendered the 37mm ineffective and, by 1943, it was being gradually replaced in the European and Mediterranean theaters by the more powerful British-developed 57 mm Gun M1. In the Pacific, where the Japanese tank <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> less significant, the M3 remained in service {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|The relief {{force of}} Clinton and Grey arrived at Newport on 1 September. Given that the <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> over, Clinton instead ordered Grey to raid several {{communities}} on the Massachusetts coast. Admiral Howe was unsuccessful {{in his bid}} {{to catch up with}} d'Estaing, who held a strong position at the Nantasket Roads when Howe arrived there on 30 August. Admiral Byron, who succeeded Howe as head of the New York station in September, was also unsuccessful in blockading d'Estaing: his fleet was scattered by a storm when it arrived off Boston, while d'Estaing sailed away, bound for the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
50|$|Maintaining {{financial}} stability involves protecting against {{threats to the}} whole financial system. <b>Threats</b> <b>are</b> detected by the Bank's surveillance and market intelligence functions.

Based on a duopoly market, we first derive the equilibrium for all possible constellations regarding the timing of threats. Our analysis surprisingly justifies the early timing of threats as suggested by Nash (1953). ...|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> {{potential}} <b>threats</b> {{to program}} sustainability. The most common <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> funding. Coordinators who take {{lead of the}} program worry {{that if they are}} to leave the school no one would replace them and the program <b>was</b> cease. Another <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> the potential stigma for students participating in the program. This speaks to the idea of school breakfast programs being available to all students. Programs that are mainly directed at at-risk students report stigma. Another <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> catering to students’ food allergies and religious and cultural dietary restrictions.|$|R
5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bessell's efforts {{ensured that}} {{for the time being}} the Scott <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> kept at bay. The missing {{insurance}} card meant that Scott's wife, who was pregnant, could not claim maternity benefits. Scott threatened to talk to newspapers, but the matter was resolved by the issue of an emergency card after Bessell's intervention at the Department of Health and Social Security. In 1970 Scott's marriage collapsed; he blamed Thorpe, and again threatened exposure. Bessell successfully prevented Thorpe's name being mentioned in court during the divorce proceedings, and arranged that Thorpe would anonymously pay the legal costs. Early in 1971 Scott moved to a cottage in the village of Talybont in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones. He sufficiently persuaded her of his mistreatment at the hands of Thorpe that she contacted the Liberal MP for the adjoining constituency of Montgomeryshire—Emlyn Hooson, on {{the right wing of the}} party and a friend of neither Thorpe nor Bessell. Hooson suggested a meeting at the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{organised}} {{themselves into}} powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations {{to be largely}} unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the Manigramam, the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam. Local guilds were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled Ainnurruvar, {{also known as the}} 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations (Vira Bananjudharma or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions (prasasti). Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.|$|E
40|$|<b>Threats</b> against psychiatrists <b>are</b> common, but {{existing}} {{studies on}} the subject lack descriptive information {{about the nature and}} resolution of the threat.

5|$|The spring {{still exists}} {{and is now}} the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in {{dissolved}} calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.|$|E
5|$|This fourth IARC {{mission was}} {{conducted}} at the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab using the McKenna MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) site, which replicates a complete German village created for war gaming when the main cold war <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> perceived {{to come through the}} Fulda Gap into Germany. The fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes—a feat considered by the organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth mission was terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established.|$|E
5|$|When William Rufus became king of England {{after his}} father's death, Malcolm did not {{intervene}} in the rebellions by supporters of Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, William Rufus confiscated Edgar Ætheling's lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, Malcolm marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege Newcastle, built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This {{appears to have been}} an attempt to advance the frontier south from the River Tweed to the River Tees. The <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> enough to bring the English king back from Normandy, where he had been fighting Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus's approaching army, Malcolm withdrew north and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, Malcolm was prepared to fight, but a peace was arranged by Edgar Ætheling and Robert Curthose whereby Malcolm again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.|$|E
