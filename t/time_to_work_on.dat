5|$|During the {{shooting}} in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time. Forster wished he had more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the free-fall scene.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of her 1986 film Shanghai Surprise, Madonna decided to sign another comedy film titled Slammer, which was later renamed to Who's That Girl. However, she had to {{convince}} both Warner Bros. and the producers of the film that she {{was ready for the}} project. Madonna enlisted her friend James Foley to direct the film. Shooting began in New York in October 1986, and continued until March 1987. Production was halted during December due to snowfall in New York. Madonna utilized the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> her next tour and the soundtrack of the film.|$|E
5|$|At the Nintendo Media Conference at E3 2007, it was {{announced}} by Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé that Super Smash Bros. Brawl would be released on December 3, 2007 in the Americas. However, just 2 months before its anticipated December release, the development team asked for more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the game. During the Nintendo Conference on October 10, 2007, Nintendo Co., Ltd. president Iwata announced the delay.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with the}} British settlers, Anglo-Indians came into Burma during colonial <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the {{railways}} and customs departments; intermarriage {{between the groups}} (Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Burmese) was frequent, especially in Yangon ("Rangoon") as both communities were innately drawn to one another. Community clubs were a mainstay of life during British rule, with most attending what was commonly called the [...] "Anglo-Indian/Domiciled European Club".|$|R
5|$|The band {{decided to}} release a live album after their {{producer}} Tony Visconti {{did not have enough}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a full studio session. The group listened through various archive recordings from earlier tours and compiled the album from the best versions. Various studio overdubs were made to the live recordings during early 1978 in Paris; exactly how much of the album is overdubbed has been a contentious topic since its release. The album reached No.2 in the UK album charts, ultimately selling over half a million copies. It has continued to attract critical acclaim and it has appeared in several lists of the greatest live albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus {{their eyes on the}} target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a fortunate time. The crew {{were looking for}} a script which could go immediately into production in order to free up <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> other scripts which needed more work. She handed it to executive producer Michael Piller, who thought it didn't need much work. He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers chased the production crew for updates. The script was then purchased, and Bailey, Bischoff and White were informed that it was due to go into production a week later.|$|E

50|$|Martel {{was born}} in Capreol, Ontario, into a French {{speaking}} family and was educated at an English-speaking boarding school that forced him to stop speaking his family's native language. He quit school three <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the railroad, and at Inco. He finally completed secondary school {{and then went to}} Laurentian University to major in history. After university, he went to North Bay Teacher's College. He worked as a teacher and high school principal in the Sudbury area before entering politics.|$|R
5|$|Two {{of the new}} {{characters}} {{introduced in}} the episode, a 19th-century crimefighter Silurian named Madame Vastra and her assistant Jenny have proven quite popular among fans, with numerous forums and SFX calling for the BBC to commission a spin-off series. Steven Moffat stated {{in an interview that}} he did not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a spin-off but was open to the possibility of the characters returning. Vastra and Jenny, as well as a revived Strax, were made a recurring part of the seventh series.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work {{even before he}} had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to find <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E

5|$|Gowing {{attempted}} to negotiate better {{conditions at the}} University of Kent that would allow more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the books, but this was denied. She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair {{in the history of}} science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in history or science.|$|E
5|$|In {{the letter}} column of issue 26, Rucka {{announced}} a six-issue limited series titled Lazarus: X+66 {{would be released}} monthly beginning July 2017. The series is written by Rucka and Troutman, and each issue focuses on an individual supporting character from the main series. Lark is involved as a consultant, and each issue is drawn by a different artist. This {{decision was made to}} give Lark <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> something unrelated to Lazarus, which had been his only project since the series began. He will return with the main series in 2018. A four-page preview of the first installment, drawn by Steve Lieber, was included with the book's solicitation in Image Plus #16.|$|E
5|$|Various incarnations of a Doctor Strange film {{had been}} in {{development}} since the mid-1980s, until Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights in April 2005, on behalf of Marvel Studios. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson and Spaihts were hired to direct and re-write the film, respectively. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. The film began principal photography in November 2015 in Nepal, {{before moving to the}} United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and concluding in New York City in April 2016.|$|E

50|$|David {{has stated}} that he tries to block out {{different}} days and different <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> different projects. He usually works in the morning, for example, on novels, and does comics-related work in the afternoon. Having previously used Smith Corona typewriters, he writes on a Sony Vaio desktop computer, using Microsoft Word for his comics and novel work, and Final Draft for his screenplays. When writing novels, he sometimes outlines the story, and sometimes improvises it as he is writing it. Following his stroke in December 2012, David began using DragonDictate to write. Todd McFarlane's original art for the cover of The Incredible Hulk #340, featuring Wolverine, which McFarlane gave to David as a gift, hangs in David's office.|$|R

25|$|The {{new release}} date also gave the {{producers}} more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> editing and visual effects during post-production. The film was first released in Australia, on September 25, 2015. It was then released in key markets two weeks later, including Germany, Russia, Korea, and Brazil, on October 8. That {{was followed by}} Mexico and Spain the next day.|$|E

50|$|After writing 300 pages, Goldman {{took some}} <b>time</b> off <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> Broadway, {{and when he}} {{returned}} to the book he experienced writer's block, so he wrote another novel instead, No Way to Treat a Lady (1968). Goldman then returned to the novel and eventually finished it, despite being in great physical pain much of the time.|$|R
50|$|A {{few months}} after leaving The Uncanny X-Men, Smith {{returned}} as the regular artist on Doctor Strange. He <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> that series from #65 to #73, drawing seven of those issues. Smith's brief run on X-Men left a large impact, {{and most of it}} was later reprinted in the From The Ashes trade paperback. Eventually his entire X-Men run was reprinted in Essential X-Men Vol. 4. He bookended the Marvel Fanfare series, pencilling a short Daredevil story in issue #1, and writing, drawing and lettering a sequel to that Daredevil tale in #60, the final issue of the book. Smith would briefly revisit the X-Men, drawing the X-Men / Alpha Flight limited series as well as a brief stint on the X-Men spin-off X-Factor. Over the subsequent years Smith would return numerous <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> various books of the X-Men franchise.|$|R
25|$|Vought's {{design team}} had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the new fighter {{if it was}} {{to compete in the}} Air Corps competition, and changes made to the design {{purchased}} from Northrop were relatively small, with an enlarged rudder being fitted in a bid to solve the handling problems of the XFT and 3A, while the undercarriage and engine cowling were also modified. In this form, the prototype fighter, designated Vought V-141 by the manufacturer, made its maiden flight on 29 March 1936, piloted by Paul S Baker. Like the 3A, the V-141 was a low-wing monoplane with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit. It was powered by a 750hp (560kW) Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp Junior radial engine, a slightly more powerful version of the engine that powered the 3A.|$|E
25|$|While {{writing the}} stories in the collection, Tatsumi was running a {{publishing}} house for manga rental shops so {{he did not have}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> his own manga. At the same time, manga rental shops were declining in favor of manga magazines. According to Tatsumi in a 2004 interview, because he felt like an outcast in the manga industry, he wanted to sincerely portray the working class around him in slice of life portraits. He was also influenced by police reports and human interest stories in newspapers. When he was given an assignment, he would choose three stories from twenty of his ideas and show the layouts for his editor to choose one. He would draw the actual stories without assistants using Kent paper and calligraphic pens.|$|E
25|$|The Villa’s {{interior}} {{architecture and}} decoration perhaps {{makes it the}} most notable example of Art Deco style in Portugal. This was a comparatively late intervention, {{in comparison with the}} majority of Art Deco buildings in Europe - explained by the many visits and contacts made by the owner and also the delays that occurred in construction of the building itself. Indeed, the 2nd Count of Vizela first became acquainted with the canons of this style in France, where he lived, and he visited the leading Art deco exhibition held in Paris in 1925. He then invited some of the leading figures from the international artistic panorama of that <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the project. Émile-Jacques Ruhlman designed the dining room, hall, salon, cloakroom and billiard room. Alfred Porteneuve, who worked in the same atelier, endowed Serralves with its charismatic pink colouring. René Lalique designed the large skylight of the main hall’s ceiling, on the first floor.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his later}} years Moody devoted much of his <b>time</b> <b>to</b> his <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the board of {{directors}} of Moody Gardens.

Towards the end of his life, he published several collections of chansons, notably the Chansons nationales et populaires de France, published in two volumes in 1866.|$|R
5000|$|Rennie {{became a}} {{familiar}} face on television, taking the role of Harry Lime in The Third Man (1959-65), an Anglo-American syndicated television series very loosely derived from the film. It ran for several years but the schedule meant Rennie had plenty of <b>time</b> off <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> other projects. [...] "Every scene of every show I do for money", he said.|$|R
