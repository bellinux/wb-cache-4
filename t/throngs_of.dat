5|$|Unlike {{a number}} of other Soviet-era {{communist}} leaders, Castro's government did not intentionally construct a cult of personality around him, although his popularity among segments of the Cuban populace nevertheless led to one developing {{in the early years of}} his administration. By 2006, the BBC reported that Castro's image could frequently be found in Cuban stores, classrooms, taxicabs, and on national television. Throughout his administration, large <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> supporters gathered to cheer at Castro's fiery speeches, which typically lasted for hours and which were delivered without the use of written notes. During speeches Castro regularly cited reports and books he had read on a wide variety of subjects, including military matters, plant cultivation, filmmaking, and chess strategies.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin {{had been}} {{completed}} three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell {{on the shoulders of}} the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.|$|E
5|$|Caligari {{was filmed}} in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), Weißensee, a {{north-eastern}} suburb of Berlin. Decla {{had been making}} films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, Die Pest in Florenz (1919) and the two parts of Fritz Lang's The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none {{of which could be}} achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.|$|E

5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E

25|$|The {{violence}} intensified.

When a bomb exploded at the Independence Depot near Victor, Colorado on June 6, 1904, killing thirteen strikebreakers, Sheriff H.M. Robertson went to investigate. The situation became very volatile, with <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> angry men gathered in the streets.|$|E
25|$|Because he was photographing rapidly {{changing}} events during the celebrations, Eisenstaedt {{did not have}} an opportunity to get the names and details.

A {{crowd of}} over 90,000 attended the festivities, {{in addition to}} the <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> supporters who lined the 2-mile parade route. The Coliseum peristyle was redesigned in purple and gold regalia to commemorate the team and the Lakers' court was transported from Staples Center to the Coliseum field to act as the stage. Past parades had ended at Staples Center, but due to the newly constructed L.A. Live complex, space was limited around the arena.|$|E
25|$|The army's {{entry into}} the city was blocked at its suburbs by <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> protesters. Tens of {{thousands}} of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city. While the Army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across {{the country for a}} final assault.|$|E
25|$|Still, dwellers in {{the complex}} are not {{prohibited}} from leaving the camp or using services and facilities outside it. <b>Throngs</b> <b>of</b> school-going Nepalese children regularly leave and enter the camp everyday, wearing the uniforms of national schools. The camp's close proximity to Bartley Secondary School has seen {{a significant number of}} Nepalese children being enrolled there, although they can also be found in schools much further away as the children become gradually assimilated into Singaporean society and culture. They cannot sink their roots deeply, however, as most of them are in the country on dependent passes, and are compelled to leave Singapore when they turn 21.|$|E

25|$|Huntington {{had envisioned}} the work {{depicting}} {{a history of}} Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific 'Vision of Spain', eventually opting for {{a representation of the}} regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain. Despite the immensity of the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted. He completed the final panel by July 1919.|$|E

The theatre was filled with many of the most prominent people of the ballet world, along with <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> newspaper and television reporters from around the world. The production was a resounding success, with Nureyev being honored with the prestigious Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture.

25|$|On 14 February, exactly {{three years}} from the day Premier Hariri was assassinated on the Beirut seafront, <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> protesters rallied in Martyr's Square to commemorate the occasion. The crowd came from all over Lebanon. Hundreds of {{thousands}} of protesters filled the square and its immediate surrounding. In the mountainous areas, the weather conditions prevented several processions from reaching Beirut. Also, processions closed all roads east, north & south Beirut leading to Martyr's Square. Hundreds of boats embarked on a ride from the Jounieh port in the coast of Mount Lebanon to the Beirut Marina defying the winter waves. The rally was reaching its end while thousands of vehicles carrying protesters were still trapped in traffic in the Eastern Suburbs of Beirut. The crowds stood for more than 5 hours under the pouring rain. The protesters transformed this event into an occasion to blame Syria and renew their oath to remain united and defiant for Lebanon's sake. At the exact time the explosion occurred 3 years ago at 12:55, the crowds fell silent as the Islamic Adhan sounded through the mosques' muezzin along with the tolling of church bells symbolizing the Muslim-Christian unity. The leaders of the Anti-Syrian coalition gave fiery speeches blaming Syria & Iran for Lebanon's woes. Saad Hariri, the coalition's most popular leader, {{was the last to}} take the stand as supporting cheers blared from the crowds. In the end and after the crowds have stood for four consecutive hours under the pouring rain, the rally was concluded and the area was evacuated.|$|E
25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among <b>throngs</b> <b>of</b> American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E
