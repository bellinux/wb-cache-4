5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia {{to such an}} extent that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{agriculture}} {{was the biggest}} industry in Ireland. In 1876, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned half of the country between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates.|$|E

5|$|In total, the war caused 500,000 {{refugees}} and displaced persons. Around 196,000 to 247,000 (in 1993) Croats and other non-Serbs were displaced {{during the war}} from or around the RSK. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said that 221,000 were displaced in 2006, of which 218,000 had returned. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> displaced during the initial fighting and during the JNA offensives of 1991 and 1992. Some 150,000 Croats from Republika Srpska and Serbia have obtained Croatian citizenship since 1991, many due to incidents like the expulsions in Hrtkovci.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1915, Royal Edward {{embarked}} 1,367 {{officers and}} men at Avonmouth. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> reinforcements for the British 29th Infantry Division, {{with members of}} the Royal Army Medical Corps. All were destined for Gallipoli. Royal Edward was reported off the Lizard on the evening of the 28th, and had arrived at Alexandria on 10 August, a day after sister ship Royal George had sailed from Devonport. Royal Edward sailed for Moudros on the island of Lemnos, a staging point for the Dardanelles.|$|E

5|$|Others {{are less}} sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common {{iconography}} of {{power on the}} Pacific and Gulf coasts.

5|$|Polish science {{reached its}} {{culmination}} {{in the first}} half of the 16th century. The medieval point of view was criticized, more rational explanations were attempted. Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, published in Nuremberg in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into an understanding of the physical universe, doing away with its Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the explosion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> of urban, rather than noble origin.|$|E
5|$|The few Turks {{who survived}} the {{massacre}} fled into the mountains, where <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> killed by the local population. Ali, who spoke Romanian put on some peasant clothes and fled to Wallachia. Some 30,000 Turks died in the battle, whereas Báthory lost 8,000 Hungarians and some 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons and Transylvanian Wallachians. The two commanders feasted together with their troops, with Kinizsi dancing with a dead Turk as his companion.|$|E

5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|The offensives were {{accompanied}} by the displacement {{of most of the}} Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> soon settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed ethnic cleansing and civil-rights abuses. These accusations were contested by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). A month after the operation, the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass fanlight depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E

Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, Irish {{people began to}} arrive in large numbers in Coatbridge. The 1851 UK Census {{recorded}} that Irish people constituted 35.8% of the local population. Although while {{a significant proportion of}} these immigrants were Protestant, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> Catholic. By 1901 UK Census, the percentage of Irish-born people in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15%, but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland. In the 2001 UK Census, Irish ethnicity was recorded at just over 1%, although just over half the population claimed their religious denomination as Roman Catholicism. In 1985, 56% of the population of Coatbridge were Roman Catholic.|$|E

5|$|Excavations {{carried out}} before the {{flooding}} of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from {{the second half of}} the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 Miliarense and 671 Siliqua all dating to the period AD 337– 367. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{launched}} an offensive against France and, {{adhering to the}} Manstein Plan also attacked the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940. That same day British forces landed in Iceland and the Faroes to preempt a possible German invasion of the islands. The U.S., in close co-operation with the Danish envoy to Washington D.C., agreed to protect Greenland, laying the political framework for the formal establishment of bases in April 1941. The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics {{in a few days}} and weeks, respectively. The French-fortified Maginot Line and {{the main body of the}} Allied forces which had moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes region, mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. As a result, the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> taken prisoner, whilst over 300,000, mostly British and French, were evacuated from the continent at Dunkirk by early June, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.|$|E
5|$|In Russia and {{the other}} nations of the former Soviet Union, golden jackals are {{considered}} furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the dressing process. Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>were</b> exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E
