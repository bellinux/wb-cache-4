5|$|He is the {{commanding}} officer of the Niren Corps. Although he has <b>the</b> <b>aura</b> of a commanding officer, he also exudes that of a friendly middle-aged man. Both Yuri and Flynn are under his command. Niren was voiced by Takashi Taniguchi in Japanese and Christopher Sabat in English.|$|E
5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and <b>the</b> <b>aura</b> of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was put off by <b>the</b> <b>aura</b> of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It {{was the kind of}} book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

5|$|While {{playing as}} Aiden, the game becomes monochromatic. Amongst the shades of greys, {{interactive}} objects are highlighted by an aura shining {{in one of}} several colours, with the colour of <b>the</b> <b>aura</b> indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead {{to speak to the}} living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.|$|E
5|$|Most {{religious}} traditions in the Greco-Roman world {{centered on a}} particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion, only public ritual. In contrast, the cult of Isis, like Christianity and some other mystery cults, {{was made up of}} people who joined voluntarily, out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others. Christianity has its own initiation ritual, baptism, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians began to refer to their sacraments, like baptism, with the word mysterion, the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite. In this case, the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non-Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them. Their rites thus acquired some of <b>the</b> <b>aura</b> of secrecy that surrounded the mystery cults. Furthermore, if Isiac initiates were thought to benefit in the afterlife from Osiris's death and resurrection, this belief would parallel the Christian belief that the death and resurrection of Jesus make salvation available to those who become Christians.|$|E
5|$|The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is {{responsible}} for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and is physically located in Baltimore, Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up <b>the</b> <b>AURA</b> consortium. STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment. The Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), established at Garching bei München near Munich in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.|$|E

50|$|The work {{features}} {{three women}} in varying stages of age, symbolizing {{the cycle of}} life. The three women are central on the canvas and are {{the focal point of}} the work. The background has a lack of depth, making it look very two dimensional. The colors are neutral and create a restful effect. Klimt's common use of colorful motifs is also evident in this work. There are two vertical <b>auras</b> that <b>the</b> women are in. The two younger women are in a blue aura that has a fluid pattern of cool colors. The old woman is in an aura by herself, and it is filled with a less fluid pattern with more distinct separations in the design. The colors of this aura are warm, earthy tones that contrast with the cool colors of <b>the</b> other <b>aura.</b> <b>The</b> woman and <b>the</b> <b>auras</b> overlap slightly. <b>The</b> leg of the young woman goes behind <b>the</b> left <b>aura</b> and <b>the</b> old woman's head comes in front of <b>the</b> right <b>aura.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>Aura</b> {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the steering wheel {{has been criticized for}} being too big for some drivers and that rear headroom was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. <b>The</b> <b>Aura</b> was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls on the steering wheel cannot be operated while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Aura</b> is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|E
25|$|The Saturn Aura is a midsize family sedan {{that was}} {{produced}} by Saturn. It debuted as a concept car at the North American International Auto Show in January 2005. The production model of <b>the</b> <b>AURA</b> was shown at the 2006 New York Auto Show in April, with production commencing in North America {{in the summer of}} 2006 for the 2007 model year. <b>The</b> <b>Aura</b> replaced the Saturn L-Series, which was discontinued after the 2005 model year.

50|$|<b>The</b> name <b>Aura</b> {{originates}} from <b>the</b> Old High German Uraha. The word ur meant Aurochs, and {{the word}} aha meant stream, meaning it was a river where Aurochs lived. The river gives <b>the</b> Gemeinde <b>Aura</b> im Sinngrund its name.|$|R

25|$|The {{interior}} of <b>the</b> <b>Aura</b> also marked a new interior direction for Saturn, {{moving to a}} more European-style interior. The design of the {{interior of}} <b>the</b> <b>Aura</b> differed {{from that of the}} Ion, which was highly criticized. On the upscale XR model, the interior came with an option for saddle leather and paddle shifters, as well as an option for back seat radio controls. Despite being praised for its design and fit and finish, the Aura's interior was criticized for using cheap materials.|$|E

25|$|The {{expense of}} playing hockey {{initially}} kept Conacher off the ice. He {{did not learn}} to skate until he was 16. Consequently, hockey was among his weakest sports. He played with the Toronto Century Rovers, and then <b>the</b> <b>Aura</b> Lee Athletic Club, but saw limited ice time. Determined to improve his game, he closely watched the top players from the bench and sought to emulate what made them successful. His efforts paid off, and by 1918–19, was considered a star defenceman for Aura Lee. He joined the Toronto Canoe Club Paddlers, a team of all-star calibre players in 1919–20, and with them won the Memorial Cup, Canada's national junior championship. Conacher then returned to <b>the</b> <b>Aura</b> Lees to play for their senior team for two years.|$|E

Some of the earliest film references include The Hasher's Delirium (1910) by Émile Cohl, an early pioneer in the art of animation, as well as two different silent films, each entitled Absinthe, from 1913 and 1914 respectively.|$|E

But what it refused to facilitate was the racial objectification of the artist’s body.
