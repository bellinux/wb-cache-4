To the number wizard's shock, Milo proves that the two have agreed to disagree, and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.|$|E

25|$|The {{material}} {{used for}} the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to England, to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad, especially from South America and the West Indies. Bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid 19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> preceded them.|$|E
25|$|In 73 {{individual}} cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces to childhood favorites, and also included popular {{songs from the}} radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> may seem familiar to the patient, which indicated why certain childhood or familiar songs were heard.|$|E

25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E

Jerry says that he feels uncomfortable [...] "breaking up with" [...] Horneck, so George suggests that he should pretend that Horneck is a woman and break up normally. Jerry therefore attempts to break up with Horneck at Monk's Café, but Horneck bursts into tears. Deeply uncomfortable, Jerry assures Horneck he didn't mean it, and agrees {{to take him to}} see the New York Knicks, although he was supposed to take George.|$|E

500|$|Musicologist Dale Cockrell {{argues that}} [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] {{represents}} {{a bridge between}} the percussive blackface songs of the 1830s and the more refined compositions of songwriters such as Stephen Foster. Cockrell says that, unlike previous minstrel songs, [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] is meant for more than just dancing; its tune is developed enough to stand on its own. Contemporary critics certainly noticed the difference. Y. S. Nathanson called it [...] "the best of what I have denominated the ancient negro ballads. The melody is far superior <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> had preceded it." [...] Nathanson compared the song to works by Gaetano Donizetti and Daniel Auber.|$|E

500|$|The actress {{described}} {{the filming of}} the rape as easier than the scenes depicting its aftermath, which she called [...] "psychologically ..... physically hard". Strickland and Brendon agreed on a safeword when they filmed the rape, due to its brutality. The scene affected Strickland {{to the extent that}} she found it difficult to act on the set on which the rape was shot. The actress called the filming process [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "truthful", but [...] "by no means is any of that even comparable <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> women and men have had experience with". Brendon was cast against type as McHenry, King's rapist, since he is primarily known for portraying the comedic Xander Harris in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Strickland said that Brendon's character should not be interpreted as crazy, because perpetrators of rape are [...] "people who are around us all the time"; she called Brendon's acceptance of the role [...] "brave".|$|E
500|$|Hoffman was {{selected}} by the Cincinnati Reds in the 11th round with the 288th overall selection of the 1989 MLB draft, and he signed for $3,000. Prior to the draft, Reds scout Jeff Barton talked to Hoffman about playing another position. [...] Hoffman was open <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might advance his career, and they talked about catching or pitching with his exceptional arm. [...] Barton ranked Hoffman's arm an 80 on a 20–80 scale, where 60 was above average and 80 was a rarity. [...] Hoffman played shortstop and third base for the Reds' Single-A affiliate Charleston. [...] In his first 103 games, he only batted [...]212 with 23 runs batted in. [...] Not showing much batting potential, Hoffman was converted to pitcher in 1991 {{at the suggestion of}} Charleston manager Jim Lett, who also grew tired of Hoffman overthrowing first base. Hoffman threw [...] and recorded a 2.90 ERA with 169 strikeouts in [...] minor league innings over two seasons while alternating between relieving and starting at Single-A Cedar Rapids, Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Nashville.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the opera}} itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: [...] "There were neither {{fishermen}} in the libretto nor pearls in the music". He considered that on every page the score displayed [...] "the bias {{of the school}} to which [...] belongs, that of Richard Wagner". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. [...] "Nevertheless", he wrote, [...] "there is a talent floating {{in the midst of}} all these regrettable imitations". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: [...] "The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: [...] "I persist in finding in [...] the rarest virtues". The youthful composer Émile Paladilhe told his father that the opera was superior <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> the established French opera composers of the day, such as Auber and Thomas, were capable of producing.|$|E
