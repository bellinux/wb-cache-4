5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> the conn for the battleship would {{remain on the}} eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E
5|$|On 19August 1942, while British {{commando}} units attacked bunker {{positions on}} the outskirts of Dieppe, forces of the 2nd Division landed on four beaches. The easternmost, Blue Beach, which was situated {{at the foot of a}} sheer cliff, presented the most difficulties; the Royal Regiment of Canada, with a company of the Black Watch, was held at bay by two platoons of German defenders. Only six percent of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> landed on Blue Beach returned to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment {{was soon}} posted back to Cape Town, {{where many of}} the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of {{fighting}} in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> they would see action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded {{due to a lack of}} personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.|$|E

5|$|The Bomber Mafia were {{a close-knit}} group of American {{military}} men {{who believed that}} long-range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not share their belief, and who were frustrated by the insistence of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding.|$|E

5|$|After a brief stay in Sydney {{where the}} battalion's {{equipment}} deficiencies were made good and some reinforcements were received from local recruit training depots, they embarked again on 10 January in company with HMAS Canberra, and proceeded through the Bass Strait. As {{they were under}} way, the troops were kept occupied with training on the Bren light machine gun and the Thompson sub-machine gun, quantities of which were hastily added to the battalion's equipment scale. They reached Fremantle, Western Australia, on 15 January and overnight, {{a large number of}} 2/4th men defied orders to stay aboard ship and went ashore to spend time with their families; when the Aquitania sailed the next day, 94 men were left behind. The situation in Malaya was grave as the Japanese were steadily pushing the British and Commonwealth defenders south down the peninsula and as the gravity of the situation dawned upon the Australian government, a knee-jerk reaction saw the dispatch of 150 partially trained reinforcements from Northam. They arrived just as the Aquitania departed, being ferried out to Rottnest Island where they joined the ship's company late in the afternoon of 16 January. Although the reinforcements made good <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> had been left behind, they were only partially trained and ill-prepared for the fighting that would follow.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> survived as {{prisoners of}} war were repatriated to Australia. Returning by {{aircraft}} and ship, this was largely completed by October, and later that year the battalion was officially disbanded. A total of 1,323 men served in the battalion throughout its existence, including reinforcements and personnel that were transferred. The battalion's battle casualties amounted to 80 killed and 10 wounded in Malaya, as well as 175 killed and 238 wounded in Singapore. On top of this 225 men from the 2/18th died in captivity as prisoners of war. For their involvement in the war, members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Military Cross, two Distinguished Conduct Medals, one Military Medal, two Members of the Order of the British Empire, and 11 Mentions in Despatches.|$|E
5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping to rebuild their friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's killings in the south, which the survivors are ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they will be left in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to take them off the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E
5|$|New {{orders were}} {{subsequently}} issued demanding further executions. According to eyewitness accounts, the Wehrmacht went {{from house to}} house over the next several days, arresting all males between the ages of 14 and 60. They were herded into a makeshift detention centre at a former rolling-stock factory. Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the Wehrmacht ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy machine guns. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> were rounded up had been killed.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the ocean at night. It then shows a mansion by the water, in which Buena is seen {{standing}} by a balcony. The following scene shows Range entering the mansion as two men open the doors for her. Buena is shown walking {{in the middle of}} a masquerade ball, in which she captures the attention of a man. The Sugababes are shown on a couch, where Buchanan holds a man's hand; they all then walk down the mansion's staircase. Each group member begins to dance with a man at the ball. Buena walks towards a mirror which depicts a reflection of the Sugababes, while Buchanan drops her white mask which subsequently shatters. Towards the end of the video, they are shown leaving the ball before Buchanan jumps off the balcony and into the water.

5|$|Washington and {{the army}} were {{surrounded}} on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs. As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly coming closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British {{would not have to}} cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before. Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> came over were two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts. In command of the Pennsylvanian troops was Thomas Mifflin who, after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington. In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, it began to rain and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.|$|E
5|$|While {{they were}} training, the Allies {{launched}} the August Offensive {{in an attempt}} to break the deadlock that had developed on the Gallipoli Peninsula following the initial landing. The offensive largely failed and heavy casualties resulted. In order to replace <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> were lost and give the survivors a rest, the decision was made by Allied commanders to move the 2nd Division from Egypt. After being moved to Lemnos Island, the 23rd Battalion embarked for Gallipoli on 4 September, arriving there at 9:30pm that evening. A day of familiarisation followed before the battalion took up defensive positions at Lone Pine. On 12 September, the 23rd, along with their sister battalion, the 24th, took over responsibility for the post from the 1st Division battalions that had held it previously. During the stalemate that followed, manning positions that, in some places, were only a few metres from the Ottoman lines, the 23rd Battalion began countermining operations after Turkish mining operations were discovered. For the next three months, due to the intensity of the fighting in the sector, the battalion alternated their position with the 24th Battalion almost every day until the evacuation of Allied troops from the peninsula occurred, embarking with the last troops to leave on the night of 19/20 December 1915.|$|E

5|$|Irataba also welcomed {{bands of}} Yavapai onto the {{reservation}} {{after they had}} been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> they killed.|$|E
5|$|Serbs who {{neglected}} {{to join the}} uprising were brutalized in equal measure. Males who could not produce an adequate excuse for why they were not fighting were killed and their houses torched. While most of the rebels were Serbs, the Pashalik's Romani (Gypsy) residents, the majority of whom were Muslim, also actively {{took part in the}} revolt. In 1806, the rebels twice dispatched the diplomat Petar Ičko to Constantinople to negotiate with the Porte. The two parties eventually reached an understanding, which {{came to be known as}} Ičko's Peace, in which the Ottomans agreed to grant the rebels extensive autonomy. Due to the Balkans' poor communications and transport infrastructure, it took several months for news of the Porte's offer to reach the rebels. In August 1806, the rebels defeated the Ottomans at the Battle of Mišar. Later that month, they scored another victory at the Battle of Deligrad. Smederevo was captured in November and made the capital of Karađorđe's revolutionary state. Belgrade, with the exception of its imposing fortress, fell in early December. The outbreak of the Russo-Ottoman War that month, compounded by Russia's avowal to provide extensive materiel and financial support to the rebels should they continue fighting, convinced Karađorđe not to accept anything short of complete independence. He promptly refused to accept the terms of the agreement negotiated by Ičko. In March 1807, Karađorđe issued a promise to Suleiman Pasha, the Governor of Belgrade, that he and his garrison would be granted safe passage if they vacated the city's besieged fortress. When Suleiman and his garrison emerged from the fortress, they were ambushed. Adult men were killed on the spot. Women and girls were converted to Christianity, and forced to marry or re-marry <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> had captured them, while children were placed in the care of Christian families. One contemporary account suggests that as many as 3,000 non-Christians – mostly Muslims, but also Jews – were converted. Jews that resisted conversion were either killed or expelled. The city's mosques were destroyed or turned into churches.|$|E
