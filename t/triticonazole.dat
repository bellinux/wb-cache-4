Em laboratório os fungicidas triflumizol, triadimenol, <b>triticonazole,</b> thiabendazole e tiofanato metílico reduziram significativamente a incidência de F. graminearum nas sementes em relação à testemunha. Thiabendazole e tiofanato metílico foram superiores ao triflumizol e triadimenol; os demais fungicidas comportaram-se de maneira semelhantes à testemunha. Não houve influência dos fungicidas na germinação das sementes. Em casa de vegetação a emergência e velocidade de emergência de plântulas, também não foram afetadas. Por outro lado, triadimenol interferiu negativamente na altura de plântulas aos sete DAS e captana, trticonazole, tebuconazole e triadimenol aos 14 DAS.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Plant PathologyMegan KennellyDollar spot {{disease of}} turfgrass, {{caused by the}} fungus Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, is the most {{economically}} important disease of intensively managed turfgrass such as creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) in golf course fairways and putting greens. While several cultural management practices can lessen {{the severity of the}} disease, fungicide applications are necessary to manage the disease to acceptable levels. Host resistance is another avenue of improving the quality of turfgrass in response to dollar spot disease, but more information on cultivar susceptibility levels is necessary. Many fungicides are available to control dollar spot, but S. homoeocarpa has shown resistance to both demethylation inhibitor (DMI) and benzimidazole class fungicides. The objectives of this thesis were: (1) to evaluate 15 cultivars of creeping bentgrass under putting green and fairway management for both overall quality and disease severity of dollar spot in the presence and absence of fungicide applications; (2) to determine the sensitivity of Kansas S. homoeocarpa isolates to the DMI fungicides propiconazole, metconazole, tebuconazole, and <b>triticonazole</b> using in vitro mycelia growth assays; (3 to determine a best discriminatory dose concentration for each DMI fungicide that will provide for rapid testing of relative sensitivity, and (4) to sequence the entire β-tubulin gene of several resistant and sensitive isolates to determine mutations associated with resistance. There were differences in turfgrass quality among the 15 cultivars at putting green height but not fairway height. There {{were no significant differences in}} disease. In the fungicide resistance assays, the mean EC 50 values were 0. 0163, 0. 038, 0. 0612, and 0. 0994 µg/ml for metconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, and <b>triticonazole,</b> respectively. Correlations were significant and positive for all pairwise comparisons of log 10 EC 50 values. Regressions using discriminatory concentrations tested were significant. The most predictive concentrations were 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 05, and 0. 10 µg/ml a. i, for metconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, and <b>triticonazole,</b> respectively.

We developed a novel quantitative evaluation method to assess {{the development of the}} zebrafish embryo based on specific endpoints in time, the general morphology score (GMS) system. For teratogenic effects a separate scoring list was developed. The relative effects of eight glycol ethers and six 1, 2, 4 -triazole anti-fungals were evaluated in this system and results were compared with in vivo developmental toxicity potencies. Methoxyacetic acid and ethoxyacetic acid appeared as the most potent glycol ether metabolites, inducing growth retardation and malformations. Other glycol ethers showed no developmental toxicity. Flusilazole appeared the most potent triazole, followed by hexaconazole, cyproconazole, triadimefon, myclobutanil and <b>triticonazole,</b> respectively. In general, the potency ranking of the compounds within their class in the ZET was comparable to their in vivo ranking. In conclusion, the ZET with the GMS system appears an efficient and useful test system for screening embryotoxic properties of chemicals within the classes of compounds tested. This alternative test method may also be useful for the detection of embryotoxic properties of other classes of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Commercially grown orchids {{are among}} the most {{valuable}} ornamental crops produced in the United States. Hawaii is one of the three largest orchids-growing states in the nation, producing the greatest variety of tropical species and unique intergeneric hybrids. A decrease in orchid production has been observed in Hawaii in association with spot and blights of shoots and flowers, as well as root rot that result in rapid death of juveniles and slow decline of mature plants. Such decline is now commonly observed in nearly all nurseries across the Oahu and the Island of Hawaii. Fungal pathogens are speculated {{to be one of the}} important sources of diseases in orchids in Hawaii. In the present study 16 fungal genera were isolated from 60 plant samples collected from Oahu and the Island of Hawaii. Fusarium was the most prevalent genus, with 78 % of the isolates and frequently associated with several orchid cultivars, including over 9 genera and hybrids. Eleven Fusarium species, namely F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. subglutinans, F. poae, F. begoniae, F. bulbicola, F. anthophilum, F. denticulatum, F. circinatum and F. semitectum were found. Fusarium oxysporum was identified and was the most commonly isolated species from all the samples followed by F. proliferatum and F. solani. All Fusarium species were tested for pathogenicity on four orchid genera. Among the 11 Fusarium species, 6 were found pathogenic on 4 orchid genera. Three species, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum and F. solani, showed moderate to high virulence on Dendrobium, Cymbidium and Miltonia. Fusarium circinatum and F. poae were low to moderate virulent on Dendrobium and Cymbidium whereas F. begoniae caused very low virulence on Dendrobium and Miltonia. Cattleya was susceptible to F. oxysporum only. Pathogenicity assays of Fusarium isolates on different cultivars of orchids resulted in identification of pathogenic Fusarium species was followed by testing efficacy of three fungicides, Pyraclostrobin, a. i. at 25 %, Azoxystrobin a. i. at 50 % and <b>Triticonazole,</b> a. i. at 20 % on mycelial inhibition on four most prevalent Fusarium species namely-F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. subglutinans. <b>Triticonazole</b> was the most effective fungicide in the in vitro tests and was further evaluated for its efficacy in on Dendrobium plants in vivo against the most aggressive species of Fusarium, F. proliferatum under greenhouse conditions. This dissertation provides a thorough study to identify pathogenic Fusarium species on orchids and provides information regarding pathogenicity on orchid genera other than Dendrobium, and viable chemical methods to manage Fusarium species on orchids in Hawaii...|$|E
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} embryo {{is considered}} to provide a promising alternative test model for developmental toxicity testing. Most systems use morphological assessment of the embryos, however, microarray analyses may increase sensitivity and predictability of the test by detecting more subtle and detailed responses. In this study, we investigated the possibility of relating gene expression profiles of structurally similar chemicals tested in a single concentration, to a complete transcriptomic concentration-response of flusilazole (FLU). We tested five other triazoles, hexaconazole (HEX), cyproconazole (CYP), triadimefon (TDF), myclobutanil (MYC), and <b>triticonazole</b> (TTC) at equipotent concentrations based on morphological evaluation. Results showed that every compound had a different degree of regulation within their anti-fungal and developmental toxicity pathways, steroid biosynthesis and retinol metabolism, respectively. Assuming that the ratio between these pathways is relevant for efficacy compared to developmental toxicity, we found TTC was more efficient and CYP was more toxic {{compared to the other}} triazoles. With the approach used in this study we demonstrated that gene expression data allow more comprehensive assessment of compound effects by discriminating relative potencies using these specific gene sets. The zebrafish embryo model can therefore be considered a useful vertebrate model providing information of relevant pathways related to anti-fungal mechanism of action and toxicological activity...|$|E

Na detecção de F. graminearum em sementes de trigo da cultivar BR 23 foram utilizados os seguintes métodos: meio semi-seletivo (MSS); MSS + 2, 4 - D (0, 02 %); MSS + KCl (- 0, 8 MPa); papel de filtro (PF) com e sem o congelamento das sementes; PF + 2, 4  D (0, 02 %); restritores hídricos (KCl, NaCl, manitol e sacarose) nos potenciais osmóticos de  0, 4, - 0, 6, - 0, 8 e  1, 0 MPa. A maior incidência do patógeno foi observada com a utilização de MSS + 2, 4  D e a menor percentagem de sementes germinadas foi observada com o uso de PF com congelamento. A germinação de 30 diferentes genótipos de trigo foi significativamente influenciada pela quantidade de sementes mortas com a presença de F. graminearum, contudo não foi encontrada correlação entre a incidência do patógeno e a germinação das sementes. Também foi constatado que o fungo não afeta a emergência das plântulas, contudo verificou-se que a sua taxa de transmissão para diferentes partes da plântula (raiz, colo e haste) é variável de acordo com a com o genótipo infectado. O inóculo da semente pode contribuir para o desenvolvimento de epidemias no campo. Verificou-se que maiores doses de N promovem o aumento da incidência do patógeno nas sementes, enquanto que a aplicação da mistura de fungicidas promove a redução. Não houve diferenças significativas entre as cultivares IAC  250, IAC  350 e IAC  370 na incidência do patógeno. No tratamento químico de sementes de trigo da cultivar BR 18 Terena, as menores incidências do fungo foram observadas empregando-se os fungicidas tiofanato metílico e tebuconazole. Não houve influência dos fungicidas tanto na germinação quanto na emergência e velocidade de emergência de plântulas. Por outro lado, fungicidas como o captana, <b>triticonazole,</b> tebuconazole e triadimenol afetaram negativamente a altura de plântulas, interferindo no desempenho das mesmas.

In the detection of F. graminearum in wheat seeds of the cultivar BR 23 the following methods were used: semiselective media (MSS); MSS + 2, 4 -D (0, 02 %); MSS + KCl (- 0, 8 MPa); blotter (PF) with and without the freezing of the seeds; 2, 4 PF + - D (0, 02 %); hidric restrictors (KCl, NaCl, manitol and sacarose) in the osmotic potentials of - 0, 4, - 0, 6, - 0, 8 and - 1, 0 MPa. The highest incidence of the pathogen was observed with the use of MSS + 2, 4 - D and the lowest percentage of germinated seeds was observed with the use deep freezing blotter method of PF with freezing. The germination of 30 different wheat genotypes was significantly influenced by the quantity of dead seeds with the presence of F. graminearum. However, correlation between the incidence of the pathogen and the germination of the seeds was not found. It was found that the fungus does not affect the emergence of seedlings, however it was verified that its rate of transmission for different parts of seedling is variable in accordance with the infected genotype. It was also verified that higher doses of N promote the increase of the incidence of the pathogen in the seeds, and that the application of the mixture of fungicides promotes the reduction. There was no effect of cultivars IAC  250, IAC  350 e IAC  370 on the incidence of pathogen. Regarding the chemical treatment of wheat seeds of cultivar BR 18 Terena, the lowest incidences of the fungus were observed using the fungicides methylic tiophanate and tebuconazole.

40|$|Net blotch {{caused by}} Pyrenophora teres {{is a serious}} disease of barley in many cereal {{production}} areas world-wide, including the Western Cape province of South Africa. The pathogen occurs as two forms, P. teres f. teres, which produces net-blotch symptoms, and P. teres f. maculata which produces leaf spots. Pyrenophora japonica and P. hordei, which have also been reported in South Africa, also produce spots on susceptible barley cultivars. Using RAPD markers, spot-forming isolates from the South African population {{were found to be}} relatively uniform. Single ascospores were obtained from pseudothecia after in vitro mating had occurred between a verified P. teres net-blotch isolate from Denmark and a representative Pyrenophora leaf spot isolate from South Africa. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and RAPD markers, recombination was demonstrated in the progeny which had DNA banding patterns different from the two parental isolates. Pathogenicity trials also confirmed that recombination had taken place during mating. Inoculations were conducted on differential cultivars susceptible to the net-blotch or leaf spot forms. The two parents induced typical net-blotch or leaf spot symptoms whereas the progeny mostly induced a jagged symptom on each cultivar. Fungicide sensitivity tests using the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors triademinol, bromuconazole and <b>triticonazole</b> showed that, due to recombination, some progeny could have increased resistance to these fungicides. Due to mating and subsequent recombination between a net blotch isolate of P. teres and a representative leaf spot isolate, it was concluded that the latter was P. teres f. maculata. These results contrast with the earlier that Pyrenophora leaf spot isolates in the Western Cape are P. japonica and P. hordei. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Conazole {{fungicides}} {{are widely}} used in agriculture despite their suspected endocrine disrupting properties. In this study, the potential (anti-) androgenic effects of ten conazoles were assessed and mutually compared with existing data. Effects of cyproconazole (CYPRO), fluconazole (FLUC), flusilazole (FLUS), hexaconazole (HEXA), myconazole (MYC), penconazole (PEN), prochloraz (PRO), tebuconazole (TEBU), triadimefon (TRIA), and <b>triticonazole</b> (TRIT) were examined using murine Leydig (MA- 10) cells and human T 47 D-ARE cells stably transfected with an androgen responsive element and a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Six conazoles caused a decrease in basal testosterone (T) secretion by MA- 10 cells varying from 61 % up to 12 % compared to vehicle-treated control. T secretion was concentration-dependently inhibited after exposure of MA- 10 cells to several concentrations of FLUS (IC 50 = 12. 4 μM) or TEBU (IC 50 = 2. 4 μM) in combination with LH. The expression of steroidogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes was not changed by conazole exposure. Also, there were no changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation that could explain the altered T secretion after exposure to conazoles. Nine conazoles decreased T-induced AR activation (IC 50 s ranging from 10. 7 to 71. 5 μM) and effect potencies (REPs) were calculated relative to the known AR antagonist flutamide (FLUT). FLUC {{had no effect on}} AR activation by T. FLUS was the most potent (REP = 3. 61) and MYC the least potent (REP = 0. 03) AR antagonist. All other conazoles had a comparable REP from 0. 12 to 0. 38. Our results show distinct in vitro anti-androgenic effects of several conazole fungicides arising from two mechanisms: inhibition of T secretion and AR antagonism, suggesting potential testicular toxic effects. These effects warrant further mechanistic investigation and clearly show the need for accurate exposure data in order to perform proper (human) risk assessment of this class of compounds...|$|E

Over {{the period}} of 2014 - 2015, on the {{experimental}} field of the Institute of Agriculture in Karnobat, Bulgaria, was set a field trial with twenty cultivars of barley – 15 two-row: Obzor, Emon, Perun, Orfey, Lardeya, Asparuh, Kuber, Zagorets, Imeon, Sayra, Devinya, Sitara, Krami, Vicky, Potok; 3 four-row: Veslets, Aheloy 2, Tamaris; and 2 six-row cultivars – IZ Bori and Bozhin. All the cultivars were grown in three types of farming: conventional, organic and biodynamic. In conventional farming were applied pesticides and nitrogen fertilization. In the organic production were not used pesticides, mineral and organic fertilizers; and in biodynamic farming was applied biodynamic compost prepared from manure and biodynamic preparations (also organic). In conventional farming, the seeds were disinfected before sowing with Kinto plus (<b>Triticonazole</b> 20 g/l + Prochloraz 60 g/l), {{at a rate of}} 150 ml/ 100 kg seeds. In organic and biodynamic farming were used nondisinfected seeds. In the phenophase of full maturity of barley was conducted monitoring survey for plants infected with loose smut in all 2 the trial variants, the number of infected plants per m were counted and the infection rates were calculated. Infected plants of Tamaris grown in the three types of farming underwent microscopic analysis and measurement of 100 teliospores from each variant. The aim of this experiment was to investigate varietal susceptibility of barley to Ustilago nuda, grown in three types of farming, and to establish if the growing method affects the size of the teliospores of the pathogen. With two-row barley were found plants of Lardeya, Kuber, Devinya, Krami and Vicky infected with Ustilago nuda. Krami manifested the lowest resistance in the three types of farming. With four-row barley, Tamaris was found to be highly susceptible and Veslets was poorly resistant. Both cultivars expressed weaker susceptibility in conventional and biodynamic farming and stronger in organic. With six-row cultivars was found no infection. The cultivars of Obzor, Emon, Perun, Orfey, Asparuh, Zagorets, Imeon, Sayra, Sitara, Potok, Aheloy 2, IZ Bori and Bozhin were resistant to Ustilago nuda and are suitable to be grown in the three types of farming.

The effect of Fusarium and M. nivale inoculation on coleoptile growth retardation (CGR) was analysed with respect to host and {{the origin of the}} isolates. Of F. culmorum, F. graminearum and F. poae, there is no significant influence of host (barley or wheat kernels) and isolates origin on pathogenicity of the species. Of M. nivale and F. avenaceum, the pathogenicity was significantly influenced by the host and isolates origin. F. avenaceum was more pathogenic to barley than M. nivale, on wheat opposite. The pathogenicity of tested species towards barley seeds (expressed as CGR) was assessed in downward order: F. culmorum, F. graminearum, F. avenaceum, M. nivale, F. poae. Of the wheat, the order was following: F. culmorum, F. graminearum, M. nivale, F. avenaceum, F. poae. The most aggressive pathogen towards both hosts was F. culmorum and F. graminearum. The weakest pathogen of both hosts was F. poae. The fungicide efficacy (FE) of all fungicides tested was decreased towards the species with higher pathogenicity. The higher FE in wheat than in barley was observed. The significant influence of isolates origin on FE was observed by M. nivale and F. graminearum only. The average FE of difenoconazole, tebuconazole and tebuconazole + thiram against certain Fusarium and M. nivale species decreased in following order: F. poae, F. culmorum, F. avenaceum, F. graminearum, M. nivale. The FE of quazatine was decreased as follows: F. avenaceum, F. poae, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, M. nivale.

Consequently, all maize seed is treated with a mixture of fungicides that improves seedling emergence and yield. Data on the interaction between Fusarium spp. and seed treatment fungicides are limited. The effectiveness of seven fungicide active ingredients against seed-borne F. verticillioides was assessed under controlled environmental conditions. In addition the effects of fungicide seed treatments on seedling blight development and early season growth and physiology of maize were evaluated in the field at two locations in Iowa. Under controlled environmental thiabendazole, captan, ipconazole and <b>triticonazole</b> significantly reduced (P= 0. 0306) the recovery of F. verticillioides from seeds and decreased infection of shoots and radicle tissues by the fungus in both experiments. In field experiments at V 2, the incidence of Fusarium infection in plants grown from fungicide treated seed was lower than the control. The incidence of each Fusarium spp. isolated changed with time: at growth stage V 2, F. graminearum was predominant while incidence of F. subglutinans and F. verticillioides increased as the growing season progressed at both locations. The distribution of each species among plant tissues also varied; F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, and F. solani were predominantly isolated from roots and mesocotyl tissues, whereas F. proliferatum F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans were more frequently isolated from crown tissues. Fungicide seed treatments significantly reduced the proportions of roots, mesocotyl and crown sections colonized by F. graminearum, F. subglutinans and F. verticillioides. A significant relationship between the severity of mesocotyl rot at V 2 and severity of crown rot at V 6 was observed and there was some evidence of a relationship between crown rot at V 6 and stalk rot at R 6 at one location. Photosynthetic performance, as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, significantly decreased with increased incidence of Fusarium spp. at growth stages V 2 and V 4 and with greater root, mesocotyl, crown and stalk rot disease severity. This work provide more knowledge about the pathology of fungicide seed treatments against seed-borne F. verticillioides and against colonization of soil-borne F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. solani, F. subglutinans and F. verticillioides.

The highest non phytotoxic doses of each treatment were selected, applied again to seeds and these were distributed on experimental field, where it was verified the effect of each seed treatment with and without foliar application of fungicides, in the management of soybeanś asian rust. Ciproconazol + azoxystrobin (10, 0 + 25, 0 g a. i. / 100 kg of seeds), difenoconazol (50, 0), epoxiconazol (2, 5), fluquinconazole (50, 0), flutriafol (10, 0), flutriafol TS (5, 0), flutriafol + thiophanate-methyl (10, 0 + 50, 0), tebuconazole (10, 0), tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin (10, 0 + 5, 0), tetraconazole (10, 0), <b>triticonazole</b> (25, 0), acibenzolar-S-methyl (50, 0) and rock powder (2, 0) did not present phytotoxicity and were compared in field. Ciproconazol + azoxystrobin (25, 0 + 10, 0 g a. i. / 100 kg of seeds) and epoxiconazol (2, 5) decreased the seedlingś emergency in field. In the experiment with only seed treatment, with no foliar fungicide application, tebuconazole and tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin decreased asian rust in soybean plants. When the application of foliar fungicide was integrated, fluquinconazole, tebuconazole and tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin the asian rust severity decreased. Despite there was no increase in the culture yield, seed treatment can contribute in asian rust´s management, increasing the safety an the revenue of the producer...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Barley leaf scald, {{caused by}} Rhynchosporium secalis, {{is the most}} {{important}} disease of barley (Hordeum vulgare) in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The disease was first reported from South Africa in 1937. The present study is the first attempt to characterise the South African R. secalis population. Topics such as pathogenesisrelated proteins, virulence spectra, variability of pathotypes, sources of variation, host resistance, breeding strategies, molecular characterisation and fungicide sensitivity are summarised in Part 1 of this dissertation. In succeeding Parts {{the focus is on the}} characteristics of the local R. secalis population regarding virulence spectrum, DNA polymorphisms, in vitro as well as in vivo fungicide sensitivity. These aspects are treated as separate entities, leading to some duplication which is unavoidable. In Part 2 the virulence spectra of 50 R. secalis isolates from a population in the. Western Cape province were determined. Twenty-one races were detected using 17 differential barley cultivars. The two most prevalent races, namely races 4 and 7 had three and four virulence genes respectively. Both race 4 and 7 were virulent on the most susceptible cultivars, namely West China, Steudelli, C. I. 8618 and C. I. 2226. Considering the resistance genes reported for cultivars Atlas 46, Turk, and C. I. 3515 which showed no susceptible cultivar-pathogen interaction, it would appear that the Rh- Rh 3 -Rh 4 complex is primarily involved in conferring resistance to the local R. secalis isolates. A total of 20 races (47 isolates) characterised in Part 2 were selected for further characterisation by means of DNA fingerprinting. In Part 3 an anonymous multilocus DNA probe was used to characterise the genotypic structure of these isolates by means of RFLP analysis. No correlation between any particular fingerprint pattern, race, district, field or lesion was found. The two most prevalent races, 4 and 7, did not share the same genotypes, even when isolated from the same field or lesion. The genotypic diversity of the isolates studied was 46. 5 % of the theoretical maximum diversity. The high level of genotypic variation observed in the South African R. secalis population resembled the genotypic diversity observed in other cereal pathogens with known sexual structures. Although no teleomorph has yet been observed, these data suggest that sexual recombination may operate within the local population of R. secalis. In South Africa barley scald is primarily controlled by means of fungicides. The continued use of fungicides on cereal crops results in the build-up of fungicide resistance in the population, which could lower the efficacy of these compounds. These aspects were investigated in Part 4, where isolates (collected during 1993 to 1995) were evaluated in vitro for sensitivity to triadimenol, tebuconazole, flusilazole and propiconazole. The sensitivity fluctuated but in 1995 isolates were significantly less sensitive towards triadimenol than in the previous two years. In a second experiment, isolates collected from two fields with a 5 - 6 year-history of triadimenol seed treatments and tebuconazole applications, were evaluated for their fungicide sensitivity. A significant positive correlation was observed between tebuconazole and triadimenol sensitivity among,R. secalis populations from these fields. However, such a correlation was not found within the R. secalis population collected during 1993 - 1995 where shorter crop rotation patterns and a range of fungicides was applied. In a third experiment, the fungicide sensitivity of local R. secalis isolates was evaluated towards two new triazole fungicides, namely bromuconazole and <b>triticonazole.</b> Correlation coefficients observed between these new triazoles and those previously applied in South Africa were not significantly positive. The lack of significant cross-resistance has important practical implications regarding the management of fungicide resistance. In Part 5, isolates with different minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) towards tebuconazole in vitro (1, 3 and 10 ug/ml) were compared in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine how MIC values would influence virulence (leaf area affected) and sporulation. Results indicated that all isolates were equally fit to induce lesions and sporulate in the absence of tebuconazole. Thus no fitness cost was associated with the degree of tebuconazole sensitivity in the present study. All R. secalis isolates were able to induce lesions on tebuconazole treated leaves, but differed significantly with respect to the percentage leaf area affected. Isolates, least sensitive (MIC = 10 ug/rnl) towards tebuconazole were more adapted on tebuconazole treated leaves, being able to repeatedly cause larger lesions than sensitive R. secalis isolates (MIC = 1 ug/rnl), Sporulation was not significantly different between isolates on lesions of untreated or tebuconazole treated leaves. Larger leaf areas affected and adequate sporulation suggest that a less sensitive population would result in more disease in tebuconazole treated fields. In conclusion, this study revealed the variability associated with the South African R. secalis population regarding virulence spectrum and genotypic structure. The data in this study suggest that it is likely that the local population will easily adapt to newly introduced, single gene resistance. For more durable resistance, higher levels of quantitative resistance should be introduced. This type of resistance is, however, more difficult to identify and incorporate than single gene resistance. Consequently, barley scald control will remain dependent on the efficacy of fungicide applications. Furthermore, the lack of cross-resistance and low frequency of resistant isolates indicates a low risk for the development of fungicide resistance in the local R. secalis population. Other factors such as current crop rotation practices and the range of fungicides being ~pplied also contribute to this low risk level. However, the status of these factors can change over time. The in vivo tebuconazole sensitivity study has indicated that a resistant field population of R. secalis may be able to build-up. It is, therefore, necessary to monitor the fungicide sensitivity of R. secalis isolates at timely intervals with view to successful barley cultivation in the future. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Blaarvlek op gars (Hordeum vulgare), veroorsaak deur Rhynchosporium secalis, is die belangrikste siekte van gars in die Wes-Kaap provinsie van Suid-Afrika. Die voorkoms van R. secalis op gars is in Suid-Afrika vir die eertse keer in 1937 gerapporteer. Hierdie studie is die eerste poging tot karakterisering van die plaaslike R. secalis-populasie. Aspekte soos proteïene betrokke by patogenese, virulensiespektra, variabiliteit van patotipes, bronne van variasie, gasheerweerstand, teeltprogramme, molekulêre karakterisering en swamdodersensitiwiteit word in Deel I van die tesis opgesom. In die daaropvolgende gedeelte is die fokus op die karakterisering van die R. secalis-populasie en behels DNA karakterisering, virulensiespektrum, en swamdodersensitiwiteit in vitro asook in vivo. [...] In Deel 2 is die virulensiespektra van 50 R. secalis isolate van 'n populasie in die. Wes-Kaap geëvalueer teenoor 17 differensiëel weerstandbiedende gars kultivars en hieruit is 21 rasse geïdentifiseer. Die twee mees algemene rasse (rasse 4 en 7), met onderskeidelik drie en vier virulensie gene, het virulent vertoon teenoor die mees vatbare kultivars soos West China, Steudelli, C. I. 8618 en C. I. 2226. Geen vatbare kultivar-patogeen interaksies is met kultivars Atlas 46, Turk en C. I. 3515, wat al drie die Rh-Rh 3 -Rh 4 kompleks dra, gevind nie. Dit wil dus voorkom asof hierdie genekompleks effektiewe gasheerweerstand teen die plaaslike R. secalis isolate kan bied. 'n Totaal van 20 rasse (47 isolate), gekarakteriseer in Deel 2, is geselekteer vir verdere karakterisering met behulp van DNA bandpatrone. In Deel 3 is 'n anonieme multilokus DNA peiler gebruik om deur middel van RFLP analise die genotipiese struktuur van hierdie R. secalis-isolate te bepaal. Geen assosiasie is gevind tussen DNA bandpatroon en ras, distrik, garsland of letsel nie. Die twee rasse (4 en 7) wat mees algemeen voorkom, het nie dieselfde bandpatroon vertoon nie, ook nie dié afkomstig vanuit dieselfde garsland of letsel nie. Die genotipiese diversiteit van isolate was 46. 5 % van die teoretiese maksimum diversiteit. Die hoë vlak van variasie waargeneem in die R. secalis populasie is soortgelyk aan variasie waargeneem in ander graanpatogene wat oor 'n geslagtelike stadium in die lewenssiklus beskik. Alhoewel geen geslagtelike stadium tot dusver geidentifiseer is nie, dui die vlak van variasie daarop dat geslagtelike rekombinasie moontlik wel plaasvind binne die plaaslike R. secalis populasie. In Suid-Afrika word blaarvlek op gars primêr deur swamdoders beheer. Die toenemende gebruik van swamdoders op graangewasse veroorsaak moontlik 'n opbou van swamdoderweerstand in die populasie. Dit kan die effektiwiteit van swamdoders verlaag. Hierdie veronderstelling is in Deel 4 ondersoek, waar die sensitiwiteit van isolate in vitro teenoor triadimenol, tebukonasool, flusilasool en propikonasool geëvalueer is. Die triasooi sensitiwiteit van R. secalis isolate wat gedurende die 1993 - 1995 seisoen versamel is het gewissel en slegs vir triadimenol was daar 'n tendens na meer weerstandbiedenheid. 'n Swamdoder-evaluasie is in 'n aparte eksperiment op isolate gedoen wat versamel is vanaf twee garslande met 'n 5 - 6 jaar geskiedenis van triadimenol saadbehandelings en tebukonasool bespuitings. 'n Betekenisvolle positiewe korrelasie is waaJ~geneem tussen tebukonasool en triadimenol sensitiwiteit in R. secalis isolate afkomstig vanaf hierdie twee garslande. 'n Soortgelyke korrelasie is egter nie gevind in die populasie wat gedurende die 1993 - 1995 seisoene versamel IS me. Laasgenoemde kan moontlik toegeskryf word aan korter wisselboupatrone en die toediening van 'n verskeidenheid van swamdoders. In 'n derde eksperiment is die sensitiwiteit van plaaslike R. secalis isolate teenoor twee nuwe triasole, naamlik bromukonasool en tritikonasool getoets. Die korrelasie waargeneem tussen die twee nuwe triasole en triasooi swamdoders reeds voorheen in gebruik in die Wes-Kaap was me betekenisvol positief me. Die gebrek aan betekenisvolle kruisweerstandbiedendheid het belangrike praktiese implikasies vir die bestuur van swamdoder -weerstandbiedendheid. In Deel 5 is isolate met wisselende minimum inhiberende konsentrasies (MIKs) teenoor tebukonasool in vitro (1, 3 en 10 ug/ml) en in vivo vergelyk. Die doel van hierdie studie was om te bepaal hoe wisselende MIK-waardes virulensie (blaaroppervlakte geïnfekteer) en sporulasie sal beïnvloed. Resultate dui daarop dat alle R. secalis isolate in hierdie studie ewe fiks was om, in die afwesigheid van tebukonasool, letsels te induseer en te sporuleer. Die bevinding is dat die verlies in fiksheid nie geassosieer is met die mate van tebukonasool weerstand nie. Alle R. secalis isolate het die vermoë gehad om letsels op tebukonasool-behandelde blare te veroorsaak maar het betekenisvol verskil ten opsigte van die blaaroppervlakte geaffekteer. Isolate wat minder sensitief (MIK = 10 ug/rnl) teenoor tebukonasool in vitro is, het meer aangepastheid op tebukonasool-behandelde blare getoon. Gevolglik het hierdie isolate herhaaldelik meer letsels veroorsaak as sensitiewe isolate (MIK = 1 ug/ml), Sporulasie het nie betekenisvol verskil tussen isolate vanaf letsels op ondehandelde of tebukonsoolbehandelde blare nie. Hierdie resultate dui egter daarop dat 'n minder sensitiewe populasie tot meer siektevoorkoms in tebukonasool-bespuite lande kan lei. Die studie het die veranderlike karakter van die Suid-Afrikaanse R. secalispopulasie aangaande virulensiespektrum en genotipiese struktuur blootgelê. Dit is dus baie moontlik dat die R. secalis-populasie maklik sal aanpas by teelmateriaal met nuwe enkelgeen-weerstand. Vir volgehoue gasheerweerstand is dit egter nodig dat hoër vlakke van kwantitatiewe weerstand ingeteel moet word. In die praktyk is hierdie tipe weerstand egter baie moeiliker om te identifiseer en by nuwe teelmateriaal in te sluit as in die geval van enkelgeen-weerstand, Dit bring mee dat blaarvlekbeheer afhanklik bly van swamdodertoedienings as beheermaatreël. Die resultate van hierdie studie dui daarop dat daar tans 'n lae risiko vir die ontwikkeling van swamdoderweerstand in die plaaslike populasie is, as gevolg van die afwesigheid van kruisweerstandbiedendheid en die lae voorkoms van weerstandbiediende isolate. Ander faktore soos die wisselboustelsels wat toegepas word en die verskeidenheid van swamdoders toegedien dra ook daartoe by. Ten spyte hiervan kan die status van hierdie faktore egter oor tyd verander. Die in vivo tebukonasool studie het daarop gedui dat 'n weerstandbiedende veldpopulasie van R. secalis die potensiaal het om te vermeerder. Gevolglik is die tydige monitering van swamdodersenisitiwiteit van R. secalis isolate noodsaaklik om 'n volhoubare garsproduksie te verseker...|$|E
