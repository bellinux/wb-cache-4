50|$|The {{core shroud}} is {{composed}} of multiple cylindrical thermal shields stacked {{on top of each}} other. In between each thermal shield is a horizontal, stainless steel cylindrical plate that helps keep the thermal shields in place. The plates are then welded together with the thermal shields so that they create one solid structure.Vertical <b>tie</b> <b>bolts</b> are then used to reinforce each horizontal plate with their adjacent thermal shields, stabilizing the cylindrical core shroud. The thermal shields are needed because the core shroud exists near the nuclear reactor core where heat is constantly present. The thermal shields prevent heat from damaging the core shroud by absorbing or reflecting the heat.|$|E
50|$|After the {{war ended}} in November 1918 and the Ministry {{restrictions}} were lifted, AJS restarted motorcycle production at a new factory at Graisley Hill in Wolverhampton and the Model D was resurrected with the capacity increased to 748cc and a new design of saddle and fuel tank. The idea of detachable cylinder heads was reintroduced with a cross strap and <b>tie</b> <b>bolts</b> to help ensure that they remained oil tight. At the Graisley Hill works AJS had their own foundry, enamelling facility, frame works and press {{as well as the}} motorcycle production line. Except for a few electrical and rubber components, the whole of the Model D was made in-house and the company also supplied engines to Brough Superior, OK Supreme and the Morgan Motor Company.|$|E

5000|$|In July 1924 {{the patent}} {{application}} for the pole design was submitted in both English and French, and accepted in November 1925. Stobie described his invention as"an improved pole adopted {{to be used}} for very many purposes, but particularly for carrying electric cables, telegraph wires... it consists of two flanged beams of iron or steel, preferably rolled steel joist of ''''H'''' or of channel sections, placed one beside the other with their flanges inward and preferably at a very slight angle one with the other and held together by means of <b>tie</b> <b>bolts,</b> the space between them being filled with cement concrete." [...] Stobie and John Brookman were so confident of the new pole that they formed The Stobie Pole Syndicate for the purpose of patenting the design and then selling the patent or manufacturing rights. The Hume Pipe Company became their first agents and, while there were numerous international enquiries, South Australia has largely remained the only place where they are widely used.|$|E
40|$|A high-strength, low-weight {{pressure}} vessel dome was {{designed specifically to}} house a high-pressure [2, 000 psi (approx. = 13. 8 MPa) ] electrolyzer. In operation, the dome is filled with an inert gas pressurized to roughly 100 psi (approx. = 690 kPa) above the high, balanced pressure product oxygen and hydrogen gas streams. The inert gas acts to reduce the clamping load on electrolyzer stack <b>tie</b> <b>bolts</b> since the dome pressure acting axially inward helps offset the outward axial forces from the stack gas pressure. Likewise, radial and circumferential stresses on electrolyzer frames are minimized. Because the dome is operated at a higher pressure than the electrolyzer product gas, any external electrolyzer leak prevents oxygen or hydrogen from leaking into the dome. Instead the affected stack gas stream pressure rises detectably, thereby enabling a system shutdown. All electrical and fluid connections to the stack are made inside the pressure dome and require special plumbing and electrical dome interfaces {{for this to be}} accomplished. Further benefits of the dome are that it can act as a containment shield in the unlikely event of a catastrophic failure. Studies indicate that, for a given active area (and hence, cell ID), frame outside diameter must become ever larger to support stresses at higher operating pressures. This can lead to a large footprint and increased costs associated with thicker and/or larger diameter end-plates, tie-rods, and the frames themselves. One solution is to employ rings that fit snugly around the frame. This complicates stack assembly and is sometimes difficult to achieve in practice, as its success is strongly dependent on frame and ring tolerances, gas pressure, and operating temperature. A pressure dome permits an otherwise low-pressure stack to operate at higher pressures without growing the electrolyzer hardware. The pressure dome consists of two machined segments. An O-ring is placed in an O-ring groove in the flange of the bottom segment and is trapped by the flange on the top dome segment when these components are bolted together with high-strength bolts. The pressure dome has several unique features. It is made (to ASME Pressure Vessel guidelines) in a high-strength aluminum alloy with the strength of stainless steel and the weight benefits of aluminum. The flange of the upper dome portion contains specially machined flats for mounting the dome, and other flats dedicated to the special feedthroughs for electrical connections. A pressure dome can be increased in length to house larger stacks (more cells) of the same diameter with the simple addition of a cylindrical segment. To aid in dome assembly, two stainless steel rings are employed. One is used beneath the heads of the high-strength bolts in lieu of individual hardened washers, and another is used instead of individual nuts. Like electrolyzers could be operated at low or high pressures simply by operating the electrolyzer outside or inside a pressurized dome...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the second in a two-part series {{describing}} research sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to study the structural integrity of joint bars. In Part I, observations from field surveys of joint bar inspections conducted on revenue service track were presented [1]. In this paper, finite element analyses are described to examine the structural performance of rail joints under various loading and tie-ballast support conditions. The primary purpose of these analyses is to help interpret and understand the observations from the field surveys. Moreover, the finite element analyses described in this paper are applied to conduct comparative studies and to assess the relative effect of various factors on the structural response of jointed rail to applied loads. Such factors include: discrete tie support (i. e. supported joint versus suspended joint with varying spans between effective <b>ties),</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern (four versus six bolts), initial bolt tension, and easement. In addition, results are shown for 90 lb rail joined with long-toe angle bars compared to 136 lb rail joined with standard short-toe joint bars...|$|R

40|$|Out-of-plane {{collapse}} of masonry walls in unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings {{has been identified}} as a major local failure mechanism affecting the global stability of a structure. Continuity between structural elements maintains proper load paths during seismic action, discouraging the formation of out-of-plane mechanisms. This is a key factor for an engineer to consider when trying to fully utilize the in-plane capacity of a masonry wall. This paper focuses on the seismic retrofit of wall-to-floor connections of URM buildings with wood diaphragm floors. The solution consists of a <b>tie</b> rod <b>bolted</b> to a timber floor joist and anchored to the masonry wall using an anchor plate. Several cyclic pull-out tests were carried out to characterize the behaviour of the strengthened connection so that an ‘engineered’ strengthening can be developed. The resultant behaviour has the contribution of different failures from yielding of the steel components to masonry cone breakout. The strengthen connection presents a higher increase in tensile capacity, displacements, and consequently energy dissipation...|$|R

40|$|Finite element {{models were}} {{developed}} and analyses performed for the tie plate, inner tie block assembly, and corner tie block assembly of a 25 port fuel rack assembly designed for installation in Pool 1 of Building 666 at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. These models were specifically developed {{to investigate the}} adequacy of certain welds joining components of the fuel storage rack assembly. The work scope for the task was limited to {{an investigation of the}} stress levels in the subject subassemblies when subjected to seismic loads. Structural acceptance criteria used for the elastic calculations performed were as found in the overall rack design report as issued by the rack`s designer, Holtec International. Structural acceptance criteria used for the plastic calculations performed as part of this effort were as defined in Subsection NF and Appendix F of the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code. The results of the analyses will also apply to the 30 port fuel storage rack design that is also scheduled for installation in Pool 1 of ICPP 666. The results obtained from the analyses performed for this task indicate that the welds joining the inner tie block and corner tie block to the surrounding rack structure meet the acceptance criteria. Further, the structural members (plates and blocks) were also found to be within the allowable stress limits established by the acceptance criteria. The separate analysis performed on the inner tie plate confirmed the structural adequacy for both the inner tie plate, corner tie plate, and <b>tie</b> block <b>bolts.</b> The analysis results verified that the inner tie and corner tie block should be capable of transferring the expected seismic load without structural failure...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} settlers of Lime Ridge, as {{they arrived}} in the late 1850s, cleared the land of timber to plant crops, though others used the hardwood to make and sell railroad <b>ties</b> and stave <b>bolts.</b> The first post office was established in 1858. In 1867, Wesley Marsh opened a store, which was sold {{a few years later}} to John T. Pollock, and again in 1876 to Robert L. Bohn, an Ohio family that also built a dam and sawmill. Bohn bought hardwood timber from area farmers and converted it to barrel staves shipped to urban markets. Bohn also opened a hotel and in 1909 founded the State Bank of Lime Ridge. In 1874, the United Brethren opened a house of worship, used too by Baptists and Methodists in the community. In 1890, an Adventist church served members of that faith. After the population of German immigrants rose, in 1906 Trinity Lutheran church was built to serve that community. In 1912, St. Boniface Church was formed to serve the Catholic community.|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, we have {{developed}} computer vision methods for measurement of rail gauge, and reliable identification and localization of structural defects in railroad tracks. The rail gauge is {{the distance between the}} innermost sides of the two parallel steel rails. We {{have developed}} two methods for evaluation of rail gauge. These methods were designed for different hardware setups: the first method works with two pairs of unaligned video cameras while the second method works with depth maps generated by paired laser range scanners. We have also developed a method for detection of rail defects such as damaged or missed rail fasteners, <b>tie</b> clips, and <b>bolts,</b> based on correlation and MACH filters. Lastly, to make our algorithms perform in real-time, {{we have developed}} the GPU based library for parallel computation of the above algorithms. Rail gauge is the most important measurement for track maintenance, because deviations in gauge indicate where potential defects may exist. We have developed a vision-based method for rail gauge estimation from a pair of industrial laser range scanners. In this approach, we start with building a 3 D panorama of the rail out of a stack of input scans. After the panorama is built...|$|R

Practically, {{it is not}} possible to inspect the thousand of miles of railway track by trained human inspector. This inspection takes too much time to inspect the defected railway track and then inform to the railway authority people. In this way it may lead to disaster. Hence to avoid delay and improve the accuracy, our propose system will automatically inspect the railway track by using vision based method and vibration based method. This method proposes continuous monitoring and assessment of the condition of the rail tracks which prevent major disasters. Our proposed system will inspect the rail track component such as missing <b>bolts,</b> <b>tie</b> plates, anchors etc by using vision based method and simultaneously do the calibration of railway track by using vibration based method. The system provides real-time monitoring and structural condition for railway track using vision based method and calibration to search the fault location on the track. Inspections include detecting defects on tracks, missing <b>bolts,</b> anchor, <b>tie</b> plate and clips etc. In vision based method camera we will use to capture the images or videos.

40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into {{the roof and}} a cross member that <b>ties</b> the angled <b>bolts</b> together. The load on the cross member is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the cross member is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of cross members. Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar cross member was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable cross members, yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar cross members yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection. At 25 cm of deflection individual cable strands started breaking at 133 and 111 kN of vertical load for the 17 and 15 mm cable cross members respectively.

40|$|The old {{bridge across}} the Brenta River in Bassano del Grappa (Italy) is {{documented}} since 1209; the current bridge was built by Andrea Palladio in 1569 and it is described in a table of his treatise “The Four Books of Architecture”. The structure was repaired many times because of river floods and damages caused by war, but {{the one that is}} admired today is essentially the same bridge designed by the famous architect. The structure is a 5 span truss bridge, made entirely with wooden framework. In recent years significant deformations of the deck have caused concerns about its stability. In 2014 the bridge was subjected to a thorough diagnostic campaign to assess its structural conditions. An accurate survey using laser scanning provided the precise measurement of subsidence and deformation of the current structure, which were recognized as very relevant. To carry out the consequent inspection, it was necessary to have direct access to the structural elements with positioning techniques by ropes. In this way excessive overload to the already damaged bridge and limitations to the passage on the roadway were avoided. This technique also provided an economic saving for the municipality. The direct inspection has allowed close observation of the wooden trusses in order to detect sections, construction details and reinforcing elements (plates, <b>bolts,</b> <b>tie</b> rods). The visual inspection of all structural elements has provided the preliminary survey of the state of degradation of the wood, and additional direct tests were performed by a mechanical drilling instrument (Resistograph).
