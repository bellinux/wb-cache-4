25|$|The fastest ever {{integrated}} circuit is announced by DARPA, achieving one <b>terahertz</b> (1012 Hz), or a trillion cycles per second. This is 150 billion cycles {{faster than the}} existing world record of 850 gigahertz set in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} was {{the first}} source of energy used for spectroscopic studies. Techniques that employ electromagnetic radiation are typically classified by the wavelength region of the spectrum and include microwave, <b>terahertz,</b> infrared, near infrared, visible and ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Although QCA solves {{most of the}} {{limitations}} of CMOS technology, it also brings its own. Research suggests that intrinsic switching time of a QCA cell is at best in the order of <b>terahertz.</b> However, the actual speed may be much lower, in the order of megahertz for solid state QCA and gigahertz for molecular QCA, due to the proper quasi-adiabatic clock switching frequency setting.|$|E
25|$|Cellular automata are {{commonly}} implemented as software programs. However, in 1993, Lent et al. proposed a physical implementation of an automaton using quantum-dot cells. The automaton quickly gained popularity {{and it was}} first fabricated in 1997. Lent combined the discrete nature of both cellular automata and quantum mechanics, to create nano-scale devices capable of performing computation at very high switching speeds (order of <b>Terahertz)</b> and consuming extremely small amounts of electrical power.|$|E
25|$|Light is {{electromagnetic}} radiation {{within a certain}} portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and {{is responsible for the}} sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10−7 to 7.00 × 10−7m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430–750 <b>terahertz</b> (THz).|$|E
25|$|Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs {{single crystal}} {{exhibits}} much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO2). Considering the atomic arrangement is different along the (100) and (110) plane, {{one might think}} the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the wavelength range from 880–1,600nm. Based on the large Faraday rotation, one {{might be able to}} use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the <b>terahertz</b> electromagnetic wave which requires very fast response time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.|$|E

2500|$|At {{very high}} {{frequencies}} , the function [...] starts to exponentially decrease to zero. At room temperature this transition {{occurs in the}} <b>terahertz,</b> far beyond the capabilities of conventional electronics, {{and so it is}} valid to set [...] for conventional electronics work.|$|E

2500|$|Research in the {{microwave}} range continues with split-ring resonators and conducting wires. Research also continues in the shorter wavelengths with this configuration of materials and the unit cell sizes are scaled down. However, at around 200 <b>terahertz</b> [...] issues arise which make using the split ring resonator problematic. [...] "Alternative materials become more suitable for the <b>terahertz</b> and optical regimes." [...] At these wavelengths selection of materials and size limitations become important. For example, in 2007 a 100 nanometer mesh wire design made of silver and woven in a repeating pattern transmitted beams at the 780 nanometer wavelength, {{the far end of}} the visible spectrum. The researchers believe this produced a negative refraction of 0.6. Nevertheless, this operates at only a single wavelength like its predecessor metamaterials in {{the microwave}} regime. Hence, the challenges are to fabricate metamaterials so that they [...] "refract light at ever-smaller wavelengths" [...] and to develop broad band capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|A major area of {{research}} is to develop higher frequency rectifiers, that can rectify into <b>terahertz</b> and light frequencies. [...] These devices are used in optical heterodyne detection, which has myriad applications in optical fiber communication and atomic clocks. [...] Another prospective application for such devices is to directly rectify light waves picked up by tiny antenna, called nantennas, to produce DC electric power. [...] It is thought that arrays of nantennas could be a more efficient means of producing solar power than solar cells.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{blurring}} is {{not caused}} by random processes, such as light scattering, but can be well defined by the optical properties of the image formation in the microscope imaging system. If one considers a small fluorescent light source (essentially a bright spot), light coming from this spot spreads out further from our perspective as the spot becomes more out of focus. Under ideal conditions, this produces an [...] "hourglass" [...] shape of this point source in the third (axial) dimension. This shape is called the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope imaging system. Since any fluorescence image {{is made up of}} a large number of such small fluorescent light sources, the image is said to be [...] "convolved by the point spread function". The mathematically modeled PSF of a <b>terahertz</b> laser pulsed imaging system is shown on the right.|$|E
2500|$|In {{general the}} {{physical}} properties of natural materials cause limitations. Most dielectrics only have positive permittivities, ε > 0 [...] [...] Metals will exhibit negative permittivity, ε < 0 at optical frequencies, and plasmas exhibit negative permittivity values in certain frequency bands. Pendry et al. {{demonstrated that the}} plasma frequency {{can be made to}} occur in the lower microwave frequencies for metals with a material made of metal rods that replaces the bulk metal. However, in each of these cases permeability remains always positive. At microwave frequencies it is possible for negative μ to occur in some ferromagnetic materials. But the inherent drawback is they are difficult to find above <b>terahertz</b> frequencies. In any case, a natural material that can achieve negative values for permittivity and permeability simultaneously has not been found or discovered. Hence, all of this has led to constructing artificial composite materials known as metamaterials in order to achieve the desired results.|$|E
2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. [...] Microwaves are {{a form of}} non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. [...] Microwave ovens use frequencies {{in one of the}} ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. [...] Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)—a wavelength of —while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect; such resonances occur only at above 1 <b>terahertz</b> (THz). Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of dielectric loss mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.|$|E
50|$|A <b>terahertz</b> {{metamaterial}} is a {{class of}} composite metamaterials designed to interact at <b>terahertz</b> (THz) frequencies. The <b>terahertz</b> frequency range used in materials research is usually defined as 0.1 to 10 THz.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Terahertz</b> {{tomography}} is a {{class of}} tomography where sectional imaging is done by <b>terahertz</b> radiation. Because <b>terahertz</b> radiation can [...] "see" [...] what visible light and IR can not see, unique information {{can be obtained by}} <b>terahertz</b> tomography. This is in a sense similar to X-ray except without all the hazardous effects of X-ray.|$|E
50|$|Electron {{mobility}} can {{be calculated}} from time-resolved <b>terahertz</b> probe measurement. Femtosecond laser pulses excite the semiconductor and the resulting photoconductivity is measured using a <b>terahertz</b> probe, which detects changes in the <b>terahertz</b> electric field.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic {{metamaterials}} show {{promise to}} fill the <b>Terahertz</b> gap (0.1 - 10 THz). The <b>terahertz</b> gap is caused by two general shortfalls. First, almost no naturally occurring materials are available for applications which would utilize <b>terahertz</b> frequency sources. Second is the inability to translate the successes with EM metamaterials in the microwave and optical domain, to the <b>terahertz</b> domain.|$|E
50|$|Zinc {{telluride}} {{together with}} lithium niobate {{is often used}} for generation of pulsed <b>terahertz</b> radiation in time-domain <b>terahertz</b> spectroscopy and <b>terahertz</b> imaging. When a crystal of such material is subjected to a high-intensity light pulse of subpicosecond duration, it emits a pulse of <b>terahertz</b> frequency through a nonlinear optical process called optical rectification. Conversely, subjecting a zinc telluride crystal to <b>terahertz</b> radiation causes it to show optical birefringence and change the polarization of a transmitting light, making it an electro-optic detector.|$|E
50|$|Later, a {{magnetic}} response in these materials were demonstrated at 100 <b>terahertz,</b> {{and in the}} infrared regime. Proving the magnetic response was an important step towards later controlling the refractive index. Finally, negative index of refraction was achieved for <b>terahertz</b> wavelengths at 200 <b>terahertz</b> using layer pairs metallic nanorods in parallel. This work is also complemented by surface plasmon studies in the <b>terahertz</b> regime.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Terahertz</b> {{radiation}} - {{also known}} as submillimeter radiation, <b>terahertz</b> waves, tremendously high frequency, T-rays, T-waves, T-light, T-lux or THz - consists of electromagnetic waves within the ITU-designated band of frequencies from 0.3 to 3 <b>terahertz</b> (THz; 1 THz [...] 1012 Hz). Wavelengths of radiation in the <b>terahertz</b> band correspondingly range from 1 mm to 0.1 mm (or 100 μm). Because <b>terahertz</b> radiation begins at a wavelength of one millimeter and proceeds into shorter wavelengths, it is sometimes known as the submillimeter band, and its radiation as submillimeter waves, especially in astronomy.|$|E
5000|$|Graphene {{accommodates}} a plasmonic surface mode, observed recently via {{near field}} infrared optical microscopy techniques and infrared spectroscopy [...] Potential applications {{are in the}} <b>terahertz</b> to mid-infrared frequencies, such as <b>terahertz</b> and midinfrared light modulators, passive <b>terahertz</b> filters, mid-infrared photodetectors and biosensors.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with carrier}} {{acceleration}} in semiconductors and polymers, optical rectification {{is one of}} the main mechanisms for the generation of <b>terahertz</b> radiation using lasers. This is different from other processes of <b>terahertz</b> generation such as polaritonics where a polar lattice vibration is thought to generate the <b>terahertz</b> radiation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terahertz</b> {{metamaterials}} interact at <b>terahertz</b> frequencies, usually {{defined as}} 0.1 to 10 THz. <b>Terahertz</b> radiation {{lies at the}} far end of the infrared band, just after the end of the microwave band. This corresponds to millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths between the 3 mm (EHF band) and 0.03 mm (long-wavelength edge of far-infrared light).|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{potential}} <b>terahertz</b> frequency {{applications are}} being researched globally. Two recently developed technologies, <b>Terahertz</b> time-domain spectroscopy and quantum cascade lasers {{could possibly be}} part of a multitude of development platforms worldwide. However, the devices and components necessary to effectively manipulate <b>terahertz</b> radiation require much more development beyond what has been accomplished to date (2012).|$|E
50|$|The first images {{generated}} using <b>terahertz</b> radiation {{date from}} the 1960s; however, in 1995, images generated using <b>terahertz</b> time-domain spectroscopy generated {{a great deal of}} interest.|$|E
50|$|TeraView has {{developed}} a number of instruments that harness the properties of <b>terahertz</b> radiation. <b>Terahertz</b> light has some interesting application. Many common materials and living tissues are semi-transparent and have ‘terahertz fingerprints’, permitting them to be imaged, identified, and analyzed. Moreover, the non-ionizing properties of <b>terahertz</b> radiation and the relatively low power levels used, indicate that it is safe.|$|E
5000|$|Answering this need, {{there are}} {{proposals}} for [...] "active metamaterials" [...] which can proactively control {{the proportion of}} transmission and reflection components of the source (EM) radiation. Strategies include illuminating the structure with laser light, varying an external static magnetic field where the current does not vary, and by using an external bias voltage supply (semiconductor controlled). These methods lead to the possibilities of high-sensitive spectroscopy, higher power <b>terahertz</b> generation, short-range secure THz communication, an even more sensitive detection through <b>terahertz</b> capabilities. Furthermore, these include the development of techniques for, more sensitive <b>terahertz</b> detection, and more effective control and manipulation of <b>terahertz</b> waves.|$|E
50|$|Far-infrared laser or <b>terahertz</b> laser (FIR laser, THz laser) is a laser with output {{wavelength}} {{in between}} 30-1000 µm (frequency 0.3-10 THz), {{in the far}} infrared or <b>terahertz</b> frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Float-zone silicon is {{typically}} used for power devices and detector applications. It is highly transparent to <b>terahertz</b> radiation, {{and is usually}} used to fabricate optical components, such as lenses and windows, for <b>terahertz</b> applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terahertz</b> {{nondestructive}} evaluation pertains to devices, and techniques of analysis {{occurring in the}} <b>terahertz</b> domain of electromagnetic radiation. These devices and techniques evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.|$|E
50|$|In physics, <b>terahertz</b> time-domain {{spectroscopy}} (THz-TDS) is a spectroscopic {{technique in}} which the properties of a material are probed with short pulses of <b>terahertz</b> radiation. The generation and detection scheme is sensitive to the sample material's effect on both the amplitude and the phase of the <b>terahertz</b> radiation. In this respect, the technique can provide more information than conventional Fourier-transform spectroscopy, which is only sensitive to the amplitude.|$|E
