After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second <b>tractor-trailer,</b> who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the <b>tractor-trailer</b> that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many <b>tractor-trailer</b> accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E

5|$|In the Poconos, in Carbon County, The Mansion Hill (SR 209) exiting Jim Thorpe towards Lehighton {{was closed}} {{for most of the}} 14th due to snow slides {{blocking}} the major artery or <b>tractor-trailer</b> trucks becoming stuck and blocking the travel lanes. The road reopened about 2:30 PM on the 14th, however it was shut down again at 3:06 PM due to an accident. This was a main trouble spot as the snow and sleet reportedly drifted on the hill across part of the highway. Drifts were reported to be higher than some vehicles. At 8:20 AM on the 14th, it was decided that drifting was occurring more frequently than road crews could clear, resulting in the heavily traveled road being closed. All schools in the county canceled classes as early as the evening of the 13th. Lansford continued their state of emergency on the 15th, which was issued on the 14th. This means that all non-essential travel should be avoided. One accident occurred when a <b>tractor-trailer</b> jack-knifed on the Mansion House Hill, Route 209, in Jim Thorpe at about 4 AM on the 14th. The Pennsylvania Turnpikes Lehighton interchange was closed because of a <b>tractor-trailer</b> crash on the 14th, and state police closed Interstate 81 late in the afternoon of the 14th, deeming it impassable. Interstate 380 also was closed because of bad road conditions.|$|E
5|$|Bourdon {{was killed}} {{instantly}} in a motorcycle collision in Lamèque, New Brunswick, near {{his hometown of}} Shippagan on May 29, 2008, when he hit a <b>tractor-trailer</b> after losing control of his 2009 Suzuki GSX-R1000 and crossing the centre line. Environment Canada showed winds gusting to more than 50km/h (31mph) in the area {{at the time of}} the accident. The RCMP stated that Bourdon's inexperience with motorcycles may have been a factor in the crash.|$|E

The National Transportation Safety Board determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E

5|$|On June 8, 1999, a <b>tractor-trailer</b> {{carrying}} a backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a <b>tractor-trailer</b> that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the {{afternoon}} of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The combination of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation made it more difficult for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, slippery road conditions contributed to a <b>tractor-trailer</b> accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{competition}} forced diversification and AMT added {{new product}} lines, specifically trucks. For example, its early Dirt Hauler kit {{was merely a}} generic <b>tractor-trailer</b> with dumping trailer. Then, in 1969, AMT released the California Hauler 359 kit. This new kit was a revolution for model building, a realistic model of a Peterbilt 359 <b>tractor-trailer,</b> the design having been copied from the manufacturer's specifications. It also had an authentic 8V71 Detroit Diesel engine under the hood. The kit lacked a sleeper cab, {{but there was a}} coupon that could be sent in along with ten cents to get it. The following year, the second version was issued with a sleeper cab.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} efforts {{under way at}} NIOSH to help reduce the {{incidence}} of preventable disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) among heavy-truck and <b>tractor-trailer</b> drivers and, concomitantly, the life-threatening accidents to which the disorders lead, improve {{the health and safety of}} workers who are assigned to shift work or who work long hours, and {{reduce the incidence of}} falls among iron workers.|$|E

25|$|Because of its height, the narrowness of the spans (there are no hard shoulders), the low guardrails, and the {{frequency}} of high winds, it is {{known as one of the}} scariest bridges in the world, especially in higher <b>tractor-trailer</b> trucks. Several incidents related to the bridge have occurred. In some cases, these have caused significant closures and traffic congestion on either side approaching the bridge.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} and decades {{following}} Executive Order 12564, efforts to begin random drug testing and pre-employment drug screening of truck drivers were not expedited, leaving the change to occur gradually, {{out of concern for}} the dangers of excessively rapid change in economic infrastructure. Since then, a large number of <b>tractor-trailer</b> operators have left the industry in search of other employment, and a new generation of drivers has come in. Subsequent to the measure it became extremely difficult for truck drivers to engage in drug abuse and remain undetected.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of those who escaped unharmed were workers {{in the front of}} the building who left through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke. Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got out through a loading bay. The bay was initially blocked by a <b>tractor-trailer,</b> but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle. Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.|$|E

A second pile-up on Highway 401 near Kingston caused a rig to leaked over 300 liters of fuel into a creek. Another pile-up involving a <b>tractor-trailer</b> was reported on Autoroute 40 west of Montreal forcing the shutdown {{of it as the}} trailer overturned and spilled kerosene on the roadway. Autoroutes 20 and 440 and Highways 132, 138 and 175 north and east of Quebec City were shut down due to heavy and blowing snow.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} fatal {{accident}} involving a Model S {{occurred when the}} autopilot was active in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016. In June 2016, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when a <b>tractor-trailer</b> made a left turn {{in front of the}} Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use {{at the time of the}} crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.|$|E
