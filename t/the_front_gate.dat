5|$|While {{admissions and}} a dog kennel have always existed outside <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate,</b> one ride now exits the park. Leviathan, a roller coaster which opened in 2012, {{encroaches}} into the visitor parking lot and entrance area.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the entire}} street was {{lit up with}} 300,000 lights for the {{nighttime}} show Starlight Spectacular, featuring animated effects projected on to Wonder Mountain. Overlooking <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> is the Maple Room, a small, higher-end events facility.|$|E
5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> to Corkscrew. Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including {{the lights on the}} stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights to the base of Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E

5|$|Originally Allen & Unwin {{planned to}} {{illustrate}} the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water, The Trolls, The Mountain Path, The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate, Beorn's Hall, Mirkwood, The Elvenking's Gate, Lake Town, <b>The</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Gate,</b> and The Hall at Bag-End. All {{but one of the}} illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.|$|E
5|$|Lord Selkirk was {{involved}} with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both {{in the area of}} present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The Métis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue in downtown Winnipeg.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in captivity, men from the 2/18th {{undertook}} a number of subversive activities including building a radio transmitter, which they used to contact local resistance groups who provided them with assistance {{in the form of}} medicine and intelligence. They were also involved in numerous escape attempts, some of which were successful, alongside Australians from other units. One of these successful escapes involved a group of eight men who escaped from the camp on Berhala Island in two groups. One group escaped while out of camp on a work detail, while the other simply walked out <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> to use the ablutions and never came back. After meeting up outside the camp, the men split up again. One group included Lieutenant Charles Wagner, who had previously been decorated with the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions around the Nithsdale Estate and who had been commissioned in the field. Having bribed one of the camp guards, Wagner's group had contacted the local guerillas and arranged to rendezvous with a fishing vessel. After hiding out for three weeks, the vessel eventually arrived offshore and took them on board. The group then met up with the other escapees on Tawi-Tawi where in mid-1943 they began working with the Filipino guerilla forces, fighting alongside them {{until the end of the}} war. Other escapes occurred later in the war, including one in which five men escaped from Ranau over the course of two days in early July 1945 during one of the death marches. After effecting their escape, these men were helped by locals who provided food and information, before the men were able to meet up with some Australians from Z Special Unit.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the film}} is set in Austria, it was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic. The city of Vienna is {{represented}} in the film by Tábor and Prague, while the scenes set in Eisenheim's childhood village were shot in Český Krumlov. The Crown Prince's castle is actually the historical fortress of Konopiště (located near Benešov), formerly the home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>gates</b> of Leopold's Vienna palace (the Hofburg) were actually <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gates</b> of Prague Castle. All other shots were at Barrandov Studios in Prague.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> of {{the main}} mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetan rioters {{attempting}} to storm the building while Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted and their shops and restaurants destroyed in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.

25|$|In the American and European {{versions}} of the attraction, guests {{make their way to}} the Hollywood Tower Hotel through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate.</b> Guests then walk along a cracked, curved pathway that leads to the hotel. The pathway goes past overgrown gardens, signs pointing to the stables, a bowling green, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a vine-covered pavilion. In most parks, 1930s jazz music plays in the queue area.|$|E
50|$|Coolers {{are allowed}} into the park with food and drinks, but glass or alcohol are not permitted. Coolers will be checked at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gates</b> before {{entering}} into the park. All beverages are required to be factory sealed.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{building}} {{not having any}} bureaucratic function, {{it has been the}} location of protests, such as when farmers drove their tractors in a convoy past <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> property in 2006 and when Greenpeace activists chained themselves to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gates</b> in March 2007.|$|R
25|$|A {{small-scale}} protest {{took part}} outside Leinster House on Kildare Street {{on the day}} the Fianna Fáil-led Government announced the budget for the upcoming year. One man was arrested after parking a cherry picker at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gates</b> of Leinster House.|$|R
25|$|A mob {{tried to}} storm the Lhasa Great Mosque and succeeded in {{setting fire to}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate.</b> Shops and {{restaurants}} in the Muslim quarter were destroyed.

Also burnt were stationery shops, banks, and a wholesale market at Tsomtsikhang, {{one of the most}} important Tibetan markets, where many shops are owned by Hans and Hui Muslims.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 2003, {{with the}} park packed with people for Mother's Day, two guests were {{involved}} in a fight at the front gates of the park, which led to a shooting death. It was thought to have followed a prior dispute involving the two over a drug exchange, according to York Regional Police. The park has since added metal detectors at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate,</b> with additional security.|$|E
25|$|The shrines are now empty. However the {{paintings}} in the 12-column ranga-mandap at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> are well preserved. An upper band shows people worshiping the Tirthankaras. Two of the bands below show processions with horses, elephants, planquins, chariots, indoor and outdoor scenes etc. {{and one of the}} bands has paintings of the Tirthankaras. Such paintings are now quite rare, since paintings of this period in India have generarally been painted over.|$|E

25|$|A small {{graveyard}} near <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> contains three burial plots, {{those of}} Lt. Col. Charles R. Williams, Camp Williams' namesake; his son, Private Robert W. Williams, {{who died in}} France during World War I; and Brigadier General Hugh M. Simonson, Adjutant General of the Wisconsin National Guard from 1977 until 1979. It also contains a memorial marker for Lt. Jerome Volk, for whom the installation was named, as his body was never recovered after being shot down over North Korea in 1951.|$|E
25|$|After this incident, Upham was {{considered}} extremely dangerous and {{was placed in}} solitary confinement. He was only allowed to exercise alone, while accompanied by two armed guards and while covered by a machine gun in a tower. Despite these precautions, Upham bolted from his little courtyard, straight through the German barracks and out through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> of the camp. The guard in the machine-gun tower later told other prisoners that he refrained from shooting Upham out of sheer respect, and as he could see German soldiers coming up the road whom he expected to capture Upham. Upham was soon recaptured {{and sent to the}} infamous Oflag IV-C (Colditz) on 14 October 1944.|$|E
25|$|The {{funeral service}} and requiem mass went ahead as planned, and the cortege {{made its way}} to Milltown Cemetery, off the Falls Road. Present were {{thousands}} of mourners and top members of the IRA and Sinn Féin, including Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Two RUC helicopters hovered overhead. Stone claimed that he entered the graveyard through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gate</b> with the mourners. Some eyewitnesses claimed to have seen Stone enter the graveyard from the M1 motorway with three other people (two men and a woman). The others walked across the graveyard and later left on the Falls Road side. As the third coffin was about to be lowered into the ground, Stone threw two grenades—which had a seven-second delay—toward the republican plot and began shooting.|$|E

50|$|Destroyed in World War II, <b>the</b> First <b>Front</b> <b>Gate</b> {{formed a}} square {{together}} with <b>the</b> Second <b>Front</b> <b>Gate,</b> and included a smaller side gate with a gabled and tiled roof. The wall section under <b>the</b> <b>front</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> {{was covered in}} wooden tiles, and the gate itself was iron-plated. Rocks could be dropped from a machine on the second-storey. The door on the smaller gate was latticed for reinforcement.|$|R
25|$|Ceremonies {{are held}} {{annually}} on Memorial Day and on Veterans Day at Camp Nelson National Cemetery. In the past these {{were held in}} the walled-off old section, but since 1997, they have been held at the assembly area at the flagpole near <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|R
