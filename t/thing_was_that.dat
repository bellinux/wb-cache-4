5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of September 25, the fire emitted was quite {{extraordinary}} and accompanied by terrifying rumblings.

25|$|Just {{after the}} station of Bolzano the track {{branched}} {{off from the}} Brennerbahn and ran along the Eisack river. The line crossed the Talfer river and after two small stations (Ponte Roma and Ponte Resia) the line became split: one track proceeded to Meran and further to the Vinschgerbahn and one track branched away leftwards toward the low mountain range plateau of Überetsch. After a long bridge over the Adige river, the line got steeper and after two short tunnels reached the Überetsch plateau. Here the trains only stopped in Eppan, Kaltern and Sankt Anton, near the Mendel Funicular station. The strange <b>thing</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> the track to the Sankt Anton station left the mainline before it arrived to the Kaltern station, so the trains had to run to Kaltern station, drive back to the switch, change driving direction again and then go further to the Sankt Anton station.|$|E

25|$|In early 1962, Mangeshkar {{was given}} slow poison. A doctor was called. He came with an x-ray machine to examine her, {{and gave her}} an {{injection}} to render her unconscious, because she was in pain. For three days, she had a close brush with death. After ten days, she began to recover. The doctor told her that somebody had given her slow poison. The slow poison incident rendered her very weak. She was bedridden for nearly 3 months. The most surprising <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> soon after the incident, the cook {{who used to work}} at Lataji's home, suddenly vanished without taking his wages. The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm. Majrooh used to first taste the food and then allow Lata to eat. He used to recite poems and stories to keep Lata in good humour.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, he {{won three}} of the first eight races of the season (Darlington, Texas, and Martinsville) and resumed the points lead (trading it with Jeff Gordon, with {{the two of them}} having the same point totals for a few {{different}} weeks) but won only one more time {{over the course of the}} year and faded back to fifth in the standings. This was a good and bad year for Jarrett; the good <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he won four races (New Hampshire was the fourth win in July) with the bad part being the fact that he suffered a hard crash and a minor concussion at the new Kansas Speedway. In an interview, Jarrett said that he did remember not being in the Protection One 400 but only getting on the plane to go to the racetrack. After that season, Jarrett's long-time crew chief Todd Parrott departed and Jimmy Elledge took over the role as a replacement. After seven races of the 2002 season, Jarrett and Parrott reunited, and Jarrett went on to clinch two victories (Pocono and Michigan) and rebounded to ninth in the final standings after the poor start to the year.|$|E
25|$|Görgei was so {{angered by}} the partial failure of that days {{military}} actions (although the Hungarian advancement, they could not breach the enemy lines, deciding {{the fate of the}} battle), that he dismissed Knezić from the lead of the III. corps because of his passivity, but also Asbóth from the lead of the II. corps, although he was the only corps commander, who accomplished his tasks. Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen will demonstrate to be an excellent choice, Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, but maybe the worst <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he did not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in the right moment to the battlefield. He chose to be on the battlefield to encourage his soldiers and officers, task which he accomplished with great success, turning many times the tides of the battle with his presence, personal example and words of encouragement.|$|E

500|$|On arrival, Navarre {{was shocked}} by what he found. There had been no {{long-range}} plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis.

Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, {{was shocked by}} the [...] "school's out" [...] attitude of Salan and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either.

500|$|IGN called Super Metroids Virtual Console version a [...] "must-own", commenting that {{although}} the game was released nine months after the Wii launched, they {{felt that it was}} worth the wait. For players who have never played Super Metroid, IGN claims that they owe themselves as gamers to [...] "finally find out about what you've been missing all these years". In his review for GameSpot, Frank Provo found it [...] "absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making Super Metroid readily available again", but considered the most important <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> players [...] "can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators". Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially [...] "nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game" [...] that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that Super Metroid is [...] "one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E
500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} round, Washington was matched {{up with the}} top-seeded New York Rangers. After losing Game 1 by giving up two goals in a 1:30 span, Washington took a 2–0 lead in Game 2, {{only to have the}} Rangers come back and tie the score in the third period. The Capitals, however, won the game on an Ovechkin power-play goal late in the third. Game 3 was a triple-overtime contest that ended when Marian Gaborik scored to give New York a 2–1 win. The 114:41 game was the 20th longest game in NHL history, and Washington's third-longest game in {{franchise}} history. Washington evened the series in Game 4 with a one-goal win. In the win, Ovechkin was benched {{for the majority of the}} third period, where after the tilt, he noted that the most important <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Capitals won the game. Washington looked to be heading for their first series lead as Game 5 was coming to an end. The Capitals were leading 2–1 with 21.3 seconds remaining when Joel Ward took a double minor penalty for high-sticking. On the ensuing power play, Brad Richards scored with 6.6 seconds left in regulation to tie the game. The Rangers remained on the power play to start the overtime period, with Ward serving the second half of his double minor when Marc Staal scored to give New York the win. Facing elimination in Game 6, Washington took the lead 1:28 into the game on an Ovechkin power play tally. They did not trail in the game and won 2–1 to force Game 7. Ovechkin's goal was the 30th of his post-season career, which tied him for the Capitals all-time franchise record with Peter Bondra. In the deciding game, Brad Richards scored 1:32 into the first period helping New York to the eventual 2–1 victory and the series win. Holtby finished the playoffs with a 1.95 goals against average, a [...]935 save percentage and was praised for his [...] "breakout" [...] performance while being credited with giving the Capitals a [...] "chance to win every game." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E
