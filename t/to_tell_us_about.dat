500|$|However, Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker {{called the}} musical [...] "a {{shocking}} disappointment". [...] Robert Garland, in the New York Journal American suggested that Rodgers and Hammerstein [...] "had confused allegro [...] with, say, lento, which means 'slow', 'unhurried', and even downright 'serious'". [...] Critic George Jean Nathan, {{in a special}} piece in the Journal American, decried [...] "such hokum mush as the familiar wedding scene and {{the ghost of a}} mother who returns at intervals to keep her son from error, but a cocktail party chatterbox number paraphrased from an old Noël Coward movie, a college number dittoed from an earlier George Abbott one, and various other elements hardly rivaling the daisy in freshness". [...] In Theatre Arts, Cecil Smith called Allegro [...] "acceptable only as an exercise in stagecraft, not as a work of art... Allegro fails where Our Town succeeded... Joseph Taylor, Jr.'s life has little or nothing <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> our own lives." [...] Louis Kronenberger of New York P.M. called the show [...] "an out-and-out failure." ...|$|E
500|$|Writers for Variety, the Hollywood Reporter and Sight & Sound all {{emphasized}} the film's final scene. Scheck (Hollywood Reporter) wrote that [...] "Miike lulls the audience {{into a state}} of complacency with a studied, slow-moving, lightly comic first half before delivering a gruesome final section that makes Stephen King's Misery look wholesome"; the ending was [...] "all the more shocking for the clinical way in which it is presented". Eisner (Variety) stated that it is only at the ending of the film that Audition [...] "breaks out of creepfest ghetto". [...] In his essay on themes in Audition, Robin Wood stated that most of Miike's films are disturbing for [...] "what they have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the state of contemporary civilization; they are not in the least disturbing in themselves, operating on some fantasy level of annihilation, with 'comic-book' violence". In comparison, he stated that Audition is [...] "authentically disturbing, and infinitely more horrifying: the first time I watched it – on DVD, at home, after warnings I had received – I was repeatedly tempted, through the last half hour, to turn it off". Wood compared the film to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, stating that the film was [...] "almost as unwatchable as the news reels – of Auschwitz, of the innocent victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam, victims of Nazi or American dehumanization".|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{should not}} think it an {{outrageous}} paradox", writes Carr, [...] "if someone were to say that Grote's History of Greece has quite as much <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> {{the thought of the}} English philosophical radicals in the 1840s as about Athenian democracy in the fifth century B.C." [...] Prof. Carr credits the philosopher R. G. Collingwood as being his inspiration for this line of thinking.|$|E
2500|$|Because infants cannot {{use words}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> their {{emotional}} states, their facial expressions {{are of particular}} importance. During infancy {{it is difficult to}} elicit discrete negative expressions like anger, distress and sadness, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the most common infant facial expression is the [...] "cry-face". Cry-face is thought to integrate aspects of both anger and distress expressions and may indicate a shared basis in negative emotionality. Smiling, on the other hand, is easily recognized as an expression of happiness, but even here there is a distinction between cheek-raising or Duchenne smiles and non-emotional smiles, which are thought to be used mainly as social signals. Even in 10-month-old infants, Duchenne smiles have been found to occur most often in reaction to infants' mothers.|$|E

6000|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment or two, and then went on in a tone that made Festing's heart beat: [...] "You gave him work and helped him to make a new start. He was too proud <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> his difficulties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Polly, if {{you don't}} hold your tongue, I'll be angry! Mr. Robinson {{is nothing to}} me, and never will be, I'm sure. Only if he'd do me the favour, as a friend, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Johnson, I'd take it kind of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|As Mrs. Warburton paused, Carrie, {{anxious to}} change the subject, said, with her eyes on a curious jewel which the old lady wore, [...] "I also like true stories, and you promised <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> that lovely pin some day.

6000|$|... "Of course, I {{think we}} ought to go home first," [...] {{continued}} Tom, after a pause.

6000|$|... "Of course, {{you mean}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> it, Ten Eyck," [...] cried the Major; [...] "there {{is nothing more}} likely to succeed, with an audience, than a good history of witchcraft, or {{something}} so very marvellous, as to do violence to common sense, before we give it our faith." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Eminent Authority {{looked around}} at the little group of us seated about him at the club.

6000|$|... "That's just it," [...] said Miss Grover. [...] "I wish I knew. I reckon we'd {{got into}} the habit of trusting her too much, but it seemed the only way.

6000|$|... "Mr. Eccles {{was going}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> {{it when you}} entered the room. I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm.

60|$|Of all the {{senseless}} babble I {{have ever}} had occasion to read, the demonstrations of these philosophers who undertake <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> the nature of God would be the worst, {{if they were not}} surpassed by the still greater absurdities of the philosophers who try to prove that there is no God.|$|R
5000|$|Casagrande & Rintala {{designed}} and built all their works by themselves. The design process continued during the construction work. [...] "The work itself usually changes its shape or obtains more layers during the construction process. We keep ourselves open {{to changes in the}} work.

5000|$|This {{contrast}} between exhaustive description (Pevsner) and passionate, sometimes emotional, enthusiasm (Nairn) is noted by Alec Clifton-Taylor {{in his review}} of Sussex in the Listener on 15 July 1965. [...] "Dr. Pevsner... is inclined <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> everything <b>about</b> a building except whether it is worth going to see. Mr Nairn, more subjective, occasionally perverse...never leaves us in any doubt about this aspect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} congratulated you yet," [...] the countess said, [...] "upon your last promotion.

6000|$|... "What d'you {{take any}} notice of those rotters for?" [...] said Stalky, playing {{substitute}} for the Old Boys, magnificent in black jersey, white knickers, and black stockings.

6000|$|... 'Now, my friend,' said Mr. Bounderby, whom {{he could}} not have exasperated more, quite {{unconscious}} of it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to any one else, 'if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute, I should like to have a word or two with you.
