50|$|After {{polymerization}} and cross-linking, solid PDMS samples {{will present}} an external hydrophobic surface. This surface will appear metallic and shiny, although the substrate is clear. This surface chemistry {{makes it difficult}} for polar solvents (such as water) to wet the PDMS surface, and may lead to adsorption of hydrophobic contaminants. Plasma oxidation can be used to alter the surface chemistry, adding silanol (SiOH) groups to the surface. Atmospheric air plasma & argon plasma will work for this application. This treatment renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, allowing water to wet it. This is frequently required for water-based microfluidics. The oxidized surface resists adsorption of hydrophobic and negatively charged species. The oxidized surface can be further functionalized by reaction with trichlorosilanes. After a certain amount of <b>time,</b> <b>recovery</b> of the surface's hydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is vacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Serious {{bacterial}} infections {{continue to}} be an important cause of death and illness among infants in developing countries. <b>Time</b> to <b>recovery</b> could be considered a surrogate marker of severity of the infection. We therefore aimed to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of <b>time</b> to <b>recovery</b> in infants with probable serious bacterial infection (PSBI). Methods: We used the dataset of 700 infants (7 - 120 days) enrolled in a randomised controlled trial in India in which 10 mg of oral zinc or placebo was given to infants with PSBI. PSBI was de- fined as signs/symptoms of possible serious bacterial infection along with baseline C-reac- tive protein(CRP) level > 12 mg/L. <b>Time</b> to <b>recovery</b> was defined as time from enrolment {{to the end of a}} 2 -day period with no symptoms/signs of PSBI and daily weight gain of at least 10 g over 2 succesive days on exclusive oral feeding. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to measure the associations between relevant variables and <b>time</b> to <b>recovery.</b> Results: Infants who were formula fed prior to illness episode had 33 % longer <b>time</b> to <b>recovery</b> (HR- 0. 67, 95 %CI- 0. 52, 0. 87) than those who were not.
