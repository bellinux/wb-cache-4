The massive effort was eventually distributed over some 50 mathematicians at Saint Olaf, Carleton, and Macalester Colleges. Telegraphic Reviews, in <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style,</b> was started by Kenneth O. May in 1965 and provided an American posting of new publications before the digital age.|$|R

50|$|Anton Podbevšek was the {{beginner}} {{and main}} {{representative of the}} first, radical phase of the Slovenian historical avant-gardes. He deviated from the established poetic forms: in his poems, he used free verse, a nominal or <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> and unusual imagery. He gradually moved from relatively simple poems to longer, graphical hymns in lyrical prose. The themes of his poetry were existential experiences, war, as well as romantic themes.|$|R

She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet to match--these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation, I soon found, was couched in the <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some comets {{were first}} spotted as minor planets, and {{received}} a temporary designation accordingly before cometary activity was later discovered. This {{is the reason for}} such comets as [...] (Catalina 2) or [...] (Spacewatch-LINEAR). The MPECs and html version of IAUCs, because of their <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style,</b> [...] "flatten out" [...] the subscripts, but PDF version of IAUCs and some other sources such as the Yamamoto Circulars and the Kometnyj Tsirkular use them.|$|R
40|$|Compound {{words are}} {{frequently}} {{encountered in the}} medical domain. Their conciseness complies with the <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> usually adopted by clinicians in daily practice. This amplifies the need for clarifying their semantic interpretation and representation through respectively the analysis and generation processes. While highlighting the peculiarities of medical compound words, this paper shows how model-driven linguistic tools accurately deal with the compositionality of medical language. These statements are illustrated by means of examples, stemming from the handling of surgical procedures {{as part of the}} GALEN-IN-USE project...|$|R
5000|$|Edward Said was {{considered}} [...] "one {{of the most}} important literary critics and philosophers of the late 20th century". Culture and Imperialism was hailed as long-awaited and seen as a direct successor to his main work, Orientalism. While the New York Times review notes the book's heavy resemblance to a collection of lectures, it concludes that [...] "Yet that <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> does not finally mar either the usefulness of 'Culture and Imperialism' or its importance." [...] The book is seen as a [...] "classic study", and has influenced many later authors, books and articles.|$|R
5000|$|In some ways, [...] "telegram style" [...] was the {{precursor}} to the modern language abbreviations employed in [...] "texting" [...] {{or the use of}} short message standard (SMS) services such as Twitter. For telegrams, space was at a premium—economically speaking—and abbreviations were used as a matter of necessity. This motivation was revived for compressing information into the 140 character limit of a costly SMS prior to the advent of multi-message capabilities. Length constraints drove readoption of <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> despite requiring more effort to write and read than standard language using inbuilt predictive text's assistance.|$|R
40|$|The {{representations}} {{and processes}} yield-ing the limited length and <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> of language production {{early on in}} acqui-sition have received little attention in ac-quisitional modeling. In this paper, we present a model, starting with minimal lin-guistic representations, that incrementally builds up an inventory of increasingly long and abstract grammatical representations (form+meaning pairings), {{in line with the}} usage-based conception of language ac-quisition. We explore its performance on a comprehension and a generation task, showing that, over time, the model bet-ter understands the processed utterances, generates longer utterances, and better ex-presses the situation these utterances in-tend to refer to. ...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{language}} {{generation in}} the medical domain is heavily influenced by domain knowledge and genre-specific text characteristics. We present SemScribe, an implemented natural language generation system that produces doctor’s letters, in particular descriptions of cardiological findings. Texts in this domain are characterized by a high density of information and a relatively <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style.</b> Domain knowledge is encoded in a medical ontology of about 80, 000 concepts. The ontology is used in particular for concept generalizations during referring expression generation. Architecturally, the system is a generation pipeline that uses a corpus-informed syntactic frame approach for realizing sentences appropriate to the domain. The system reads XML documents conforming to the HL 7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) Standard and enhances them with generated text and references to the used data elements. We conducted a first clinical trial evaluation with medical staff and report on the findings...|$|R
5000|$|Newspaper {{headlines}} {{are written}} in a <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> (headlinese) which often omits the copula, creating syntactic ambiguity. A common form is the garden path type. The name crash blossoms was proposed for these ambiguous headlines by Danny Bloom in the Testy Copy Editors discussion group in August 2009. He based this on the headline [...] "Violinist linked to JAL crash blossoms" [...] that Mike O'Connell had posted, asking what such a headline could be called. The Columbia Journalism Review regularly reprints such headlines in its [...] "The Lower Case" [...] column, and has collected them in the anthologies [...] "Squad Helps Dog Bite Victim" [...] and [...] "Red Tape Holds Up New Bridge". Language Log also has an extensive archive of crash blossoms, for example [...] "Infant Pulled from Wrecked Car Involved in Short Police Pursuit".|$|R
40|$|Delivering aphasia therapy via {{telecommunication}} {{may provide}} a means to deliver intensive therapy in a cost-effective way. Teletherapy, remotely-administered (language) treatment, may support the repetitive drill practices that people with chronic aphasia need to perform when learning to compensate for their lasting language difficulties. The use of teletherapy may allow speech and language pathologists (SLPs) to focus in-person sessions more strongly on the generalisation of therapy effects to daily life. This single subject study is an investigation whether a teletherapy application called e-REST meets the criteria of accessibility, user-friendliness, as well as effectiveness. e-REST, the teletherapy version of the Dutch and adapted Reduced Syntax Therapy, teaches chronically aphasic speakers of Dutch who experience difficulties in sentence production to convey their messages {{in a kind of}} <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style.</b> The results obtained suggest that it is reasonable to conduct a larger study into the user-friendliness, accessibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of e-REST...|$|R

50|$|Fragmentation {{is another}} {{important}} aspect of postmodern literature. Various elements, concerning plot, characters, themes, imagery and factual references are fragmented and dispersed throughout the entire work. In general, there is an interrupted sequence of events, character development and action which can at first glance look modern. Fragmentation purports, however, to depict a metaphysically unfounded, chaotic universe. It can occur in language, sentence structure or grammar. In Z213: Exit, a fictional diary by Greek writer Dimitris Lyacos, {{one of the major}} exponents of fragmentation in postmodern literature, an almost <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> is adopted, devoid, in most part, of articles and conjunctions. The text is interspersed with lacunae and everyday language combines with poetry and biblical references leading up to syntax disruption and distortion of grammar. A sense of alienation of character and world is created by a language medium invented to form a kind of intermittent syntax structure which complements the illustration of the main character's subconscious fears and paranoia {{in the course of his}} exploration of a seemingly chaotic world.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style,</b> because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Wendy Lesser, {{reviewing}} the novel for The New York Times wrote:What the real Los Angeles possesses, amid all its fiery disintegration, is what Mr. Ellroy's latest novel keenly lacks: a coherent narrative line. We may not have been pleased about what was happening this spring, but we knew why it was happening. In White Jazz, I was lost by page 56 - the page on which the author explicitly reveals whatever plot the novel is going to have. ("Instinct - call me bait - a bad cop sent out to draw heat," [...] Klein correctly guesses.) For the next 300 pages {{it was just a matter}} of waiting out the body count and wishing for a more interesting variety of subject-verb combinations. Mr. Ellroy, in order to pack maximo action into minimo pages, has developed what he clearly views as a whiplash <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style.</b> No doubt the violence done to the English language is meant to mirror the violence done to humanity by its fellow humanity (I'm being charitable here). But we can't really begin to care about characters who never even get to inhabit a complete sentence.|$|R

40|$|In his book, The Art of Plain Talk, Mr. Rudolf Flesch makes many assertions {{which seem}} convincingly {{plausible}} {{on the face}} of them, but which prove to be oversimplifications or plain distortions of fact if one troubles to look beneath the surface. Good examples are the comparisons he is fond of drawing between English and other languages. He tells us, for instance, that Modern Persian 2 ̆ 2 has done away with articles, 2 ̆ 2 and admires that as 2 ̆ 2 exactly the same simplification [that] is being used today by our headline writers. 2 ̆ 2 Now of course the <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> of newspaper headlines serves its purpose well enough most of the time, but it is frequently misleading as to the real content of the news, and occasionally produces amusing ambiguities. English has no monopoly on this telescoped style, and some languages are better equipped to handle it than ours is. As for 2 ̆ 2 doing away with articles, 2 ̆ 2 the gradual evolution of the function of the definite article in modern languages is a very interesting study which we cannot go into here.

50|$|As a <b>style,</b> <b>Abstract</b> Expressionism also ranged {{over two}} very {{different}} sensibilities, both reflected in Edwards' work. One was characterized by energetic brushwork and rhythmic, dynamic compositions, {{as seen in the}} works of Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell and Antoni Tàpies. The other was more contemplative in mood and made up of subtle color harmonies, often sombre, with relatively static compositions and simple forms, exemplified by the paintings of Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt.|$|R
50|$|Weiner’s {{writing is}} characterised by its {{exceptionally}} bold <b>telegraphic</b> writing <b>style,</b> {{one that has}} a truly cinematic feels in the sheer convulsive power of the images that are evoked and their deeply unsettling visionary tone. He would even seem to defy the cinema (unless one were {{to think of the}} more theatrical and stylized approach of certain animators and graphic artists). He is, however, also able to achieve in his phantasmagorical and often violent universe an exceedingly delicate and fragile realm of characters despite their being inhabited by a world all too overwhelmingly hostile and mad.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the different NLP techniques designed and used in collaboration between the CLLE-ERSS research laboratory and the CFH / Safety Data company to manage and analyse aviation incident reports. These reports are written every time anything abnormal occurs during a civil air flight. Although most of them relate routine problems, they are a valuable {{source of information about}} possible sources of greater danger. These texts are written in plain language, show a wide range of linguistic variation (<b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> overcrowded by acronyms or standard prose) and exist in different languages, even for a single company/country (although our main focus is on English and French). In addition to their variety, their sheer quantity (e. g. 600 /month for a large airline company) clearly requires the use of advanced NLP and text mining techniques in order to extract useful information from them. Although this context and objectives seem to indicate that standard NLP techniques can be applied in a straightforward manner, innovative techniques are required to handle the specifics of aviation report text and the complex classification systems. We present several tools that aim at a better access to this data (classification and information retrieval), and help aviation safety experts in their analyses (data/text mining and interactive analysis). Some of these tools are currently in test or in use both at the national and international levels, by airline companies as well as by regulation authorities (DGAC, EASA, ICAO) ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{treatment}} of the mammals of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM). GSENM was established in 1996 as a 1. 7 -million-acre (680, 000 -ha) federal land reserve {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). To successfully manage this new monument, the BLM is presently developing a management action plan. To provide information for the proper management of mammal species of the area, we have reviewed background literature for each mammal potentially found within the Monument boundaries. We propose that a core area, surrounded by a buffer matrix, be used in GSENM and surrounding public lands to preserve ecological processes in their natural state. One hundred thirteen mammalian species are categorized as follows: 82 contemporary species, 21 species questionably present, 4 introduced species reportedly in the Monument, and 6 historical species. Altogether, potentially 107 mammalian species exist there currently. Of 82 contemporary species, 11 are listed in the Utah State Sensitive Species List, 1 in the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of World Flora and Fauna (CITES), and 1 in the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red Book. Mammals listed under the 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) are noted when applicable, as well as State of Utah listings as endangered, threatened, sensitive, or extirpated.

40|$|After {{more than}} a decade of field studies, {{laboratory}} work and literature research this much anticipated identification guide for the marine benthic animals of Chilean Patagonia has become reality. An intense and meticulous editing process resulted in 47 chapters authored by 47 internationally renowned scientists from 28 institutions in 14 countries. Introductions to each taxonomic group provide background information on morphology, biology, examination and identification methods, and an overview on the current level of knowledge. Lists of all species described for the region are provided as well as detailed instructions on the proper sampling and preservation techniques. The most relevant features for reliable identification of 473 selected macrobenthic species from 13 phyla are described in detail and accompanied by identification keys, microscope illustrations, drawings and photos of outstanding quality that almost exclusively show actually examined specimens. The species descriptions are complete with information on possibilities for confusion, biology, abundance, distribution and relevant literature. The well thought-out <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> makes the species descriptions unambiguous, quick to comprehend and together with the keys and illustrations results in unbeatably fast and reliable identifications. Introductory chapters to geology, geography, oceanography and ecology of the fjord region provide important background information. This book combines scientific information of the highest standard with practical instructions and makes a great visual impact. The comprehensiveness and quality of this book make it a reference work - an essential working tool for the professional, a learning tool for the student, and a guide for the diver and hobby naturalist...|$|R

500|$|Except {{for a few}} {{possible}} glyphs cut {{in stone}} (see petroglyphs), all surviving texts are inscribed in wood. According to tradition, the tablets were made of toromiro wood. However, Orliac (2005) examined seven objects (tablets B, C, G, H, K, Q, and reimiro L) with stereo optical and scanning electron microscopes and determined that all were instead made from Pacific rosewood (Thespesia populnea); the same identification had been made for tablet M in 1934. This 15-meter tree, known as [...] "Pacific rosewood" [...] for its color and called mako‘i in Rapanui, is used for sacred groves and carvings throughout eastern Polynesia and was evidently brought to Easter Island by the first settlers. However, not all the wood was native: Orliac (2007) established that tablets N, P, and S were made of South African Yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius) and therefore that the wood had arrived with Western contact. Fischer describes P as [...] "a damaged and reshapen European or American oar", as are A (which is European ash, Fraxinus excelsior) and V; notes that wood from the wreck of a Western boat {{was said to have}} been used for many tablets; and that both P and S had been recycled as planking for a Rapanui driftwood canoe, suggesting that by that time the tablets had little value to the islanders as texts. Several texts, including O, are carved on gnarled driftwood. The fact that the islanders were reduced to inscribing driftwood, and were regardless extremely economical in their use of wood, may have had consequences for the structure of the script, such as the abundance of ligatures and potentially a <b>telegraphic</b> <b>style</b> of writing that would complicate textual analysis.|$|R
