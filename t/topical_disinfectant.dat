In the last years, these products have been successfully used as a <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectant</b> in a number of serious skin affections. The medical application of empirically prepared ozonated oil has yielded striking improvements with unexpected and rapid healing, compelling us to begin a long-range study aiming first to define the main characteristics of the most common ozonated vegetable oils, about which there is usually no medical consensus {{because of the lack of}} standardization of their technological parameters. Sesame oil was selected because of its great amount of polyunsaturated acyl groups, as well as natural antioxidants. Moreover, we have determined the kinetics and optimal conditions of ozonation (e. g., ozone concentrations, time of exposure, temperature) for obtaining an ozonated oil characterized by well-established technological and physico- chemical properties, namely an accurate peroxide value determination. On the basis of the results, we have gained an understanding of the modifications of the vegetable oils during the ozonation process...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{characterize}} the antibacterial synergy of the antimicrobial peptide, ranalexin, used {{in combination with}} the anti-staphylococcal endopeptidase, lysostaphin, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and to assess the combination’s potential as a <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectant</b> or decolonizing agent for MRSA. MRSA causes potentially lethal infections, and pre-operative patients colonized with MRSA are often treated with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin cream to eradicate carriage. However, chlorhexidine is unsuitable for some patients, and mupirocin resistance is increasingly encountered, indicating new agents are required. Methods and Results: Using an ex vivo assay, ranalexin and lysostaphin tested in combination reduced viable MRSA on human skin {{to a greater extent than}} either compound individually. The combination killed bacteria within 5 min and remained effective and synergistic even in high salt and low pH conditions. Conclusions: The combination is active against MRSA on human skin and under conditions that may be encountered in sweat. Significance and Impact of the Study: Although the exact mechanism of activity remains unresolved, considering its specific spectrum of activity, fast killing kinetics and low likelihood of resistance arising, the combination of ranalexin with lysostaphin warrants consideration as a new agent to eradicate nasal and skin carriage of Staph. aureus, including MRSA...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture is an {{increasingly}} important force in both the Malaysian {{as well as the}} Singaporean economies. In recent years, Singapore has focused on the aquarium fish trade, {{making it one of the}} largest ornamental fish production and transhipment centers in the world. Similarly, the Malaysian aquaculture industry has made rapid strides in the last few years and is poised to become a major contributor to the national fish supply by the early part of the next century. A significant trend in both countries has been the growing intensification of culture systems to achieve higher production per unit area. This has led to a greater occurrence of disease, particularly among aquarium fish, shrimp and marine fish farms. To obviate and control these diseases, there has been a concurrent increase in the use of chemotherapeutants. The three major groups of commonly used chemotherapeutants are: <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectants,</b> antimicrobials and probiotics. There is a wide range of <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectants</b> used by aquafarmers. The most common of these include lime, teaseed cake, formalin, benzalkonium chloride, acriflavine, malachite green, hypochlorite and poly-vinyl pyrrolidine. Of these, lime and teaseed cake are used exclusively in ponds, and acriflavine and malachite green only in hatcheries, while the others are used in both systems. Antimicrobials being used include sulfonamides, tetracyclines, nitrofurans, chloramphenicol, oxolinic acid and virginiamycin. A number of other chemotherapeutants are also used, albeit on a limited basis.

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted on}} shoulder ulcers in sows. Shoulder ulcers are caused by pressure that the shoulder blade exerts against tissues that overlie it. Those issues lose blood supply and die. Because the pressure is directed outward, tissue damage occurs before the ulcer is evident on the skin surface. Ulcer prevalence is highly variable; 0 to more than 20 % of the sows in 218 herds evaluated had shoulder ulcers. Ulcers usually develop during late gestation and early lactation and many heal shortly after weaning. Numerous risk factors for developing shoulder ulcers have been identified. Inactivity and thin sow body condition {{seem to be the}} most important ulcer risk factors. Thus, farrowing caretakers may be able to prevent ulcers by carefully monitoring each sow’s lying behavior and attempting to fix any problem that restricts movement. Checking the gestation and lactation feeding programs to ensure that sows enter the farrowing area in proper body condition also may prevent ulcers. Experience from Denmark indicates a pad fixed to the shoulder of sows at the first sign of redness in the skin may prevent ulcers too. Sows starting to develop an ulcer benefit from treatment of underlying issues that cause inactivity, daily application of a <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectant,</b> early weaning and movement to a hospital pen, or a rubber mat to lie on in the farrowing crate. Close observation and appropriate care of sows especially around the time of farrowing should keep the incidence of shoulder ulcers low in the pork industry...|$|E
40|$|Environmentalist {{organizations}} have perceived nanotechnology to {{be a new}} technology that is opportunistic to campaign against. Nanosilver has been selected as a key target for nano-fear campaigning. When viewed through the prism of their priorities, it is a material with growing presence in consumer products (“visible”) and is supported by a small and fragmented niche industry (“weak opposition”) – ideal preconditions for a public campaign. Nanosilver may use the term „nano ‟ due {{to the size of the}} particles, but it is not a new material and in fact has a decades-long history of safe and regulated use. Development of bacterial resistance to silver has often been presented as a concern for silver use in general. The decision to focus on nanosilver for an issue presented as general for silver illustrates a bias that is not justified. Nanosilver has been made and used by man for decades. The earliest rational synthesis of nanosilver to our knowledge was by Carey Lea in 1889 [1]. Throughout the early 1900 ‟s nanoscale silver was one of the earliest materials that formed the basis of colloid science- the discipline focused on the synthesis and characterization of extremely small particles [2]. In the first half of last century, nanoscale silver was referred to as “millimicron silver ” or “colloidal silver”. Colloidal nanosilver was widely and successfully used as a <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectant</b> throughout the first decades of the 20 th century until antibiotics took over as the technology of choice [3].

40|$|Three {{bacterial}} diseases (ulcerative stomatitis, obstructive rhinitis and pneumonia) and associated complexes were together responsible for mortality rates {{of up to}} 70 % in farmed and oceanarium-reared turtles (Chelonia mydas and Caretta caretta). Hatchlings 5 to 12 wk old and juveniles 3 to 6 mo old were particularly susceptible to ulcerative stomatitis and bronchopneumonia respectively (58. 6 and 58. 3 % of the cases diagnosed). Obstructive rhinitis was secondary to ulcerative stomatitis, being present in 70 % of hatchlings with mouth rot or "canker. " Focal pneumonia occurred more frequently in juveniles (81. 8 % or 9 / 11 affected). The 5 disease complexes observed (ulcerative stomatitis - bronchopneumonia; ulcerative stomatitis - obstructive rhinitis; ulcerative stomatitis - obstructive rhinitis - bronchopneumonia; obstructive rhinitis - bronchopneumonia; and ulcerative stomatitis - focal pneumonia) were equally distributed amongst hatchlings and juveniles. It {{was not possible to}} compare the relative susceptibility of green turtles and loggerheads, because of the small number of loggerheads involved (3). The percentage of farmed and oceanarium-reared turtles showing {{one or more of these}} diseases was similar (65 % (65 / 100) and 66. 6 % (10 / 15) respectively). The clinico-pathological features of the major diseases are described. Three bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila and Flavobacterium sp.) were repeatedly isolated from cases of ulcerative stomatitis and obstructive rhinitis. In addition to the above organisms 4 genera of fungi (Paecilomyces sp., Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp. and Fusarium sp.) were recovered form caseous material lodged inside the trachea and bronchi of turtles with bronchopneumonia.

40|$|Humans may {{be exposed}} to organic forms of mercury by either inhalation, oral, or dermal routes, {{and the effects of}} such {{exposure}} depend upon both the type of mercury to which exposed and the magnitude of the exposure. In general, the effects of exposure to organic mercury are primarily neurologic, while a host of other organ systems may also be involved, including gastrointestinal, respiratory, hepatic, immune, dermal, and renal. While the primary source of exposure to organic mercury for most populations is the consumption of methylmercury-contaminated ®sh and shell®sh, {{there are a number of}} other organomercurials to which humans might be exposed. The antibacterial and antifungal properties of organomercurials have resulted in their long use as <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectants</b> (thimerosal and merbromin) and preservatives in medical preparations (thimerosal) and grain products (both methyl and ethyl mercurials).

40|$|Background: Peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) is {{an important}} therapy for patients with end-stage kidney disease and is used in more than 200, 000 such patients globally. However, its value is often limited {{by the development of}} infections such as peritonitis and exit-site and tunnel infections. Multiple strategies have been developed {{to reduce the risk of}} peritonitis including antibiotics, <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectants</b> to the exit site and antifungal agents. However, the effectiveness of these strategies has been variable and are based on a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The optimal preventive strategies to reduce the occurrence of peritonitis remain unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of antimicrobial strategies used to prevent peritonitis in PD patients. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant 2 ̆ 7 s Specialised Register to 4 October 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials. gov. Selection criteria: RCTs or quasi-RCTs in patients receiving chronic PD, which evaluated any antimicrobial agents used systemically or locally to prevent peritonitis or exit-site/tunnel infection were included.

40|$|Ethanol has {{important}} uses as a solvent, <b>topical</b> <b>disinfectant,</b> principal psychoactive in alcoholic beverages, {{and as a}} biofuel. Currently, ethanol production consists of two/three-step processes using starchy foodstuffs or other feedstock, like sugarcane, cereal crops and maize, as starting materials. However, the production is costly and inefficient, and has {{a negative impact on}} agricultural price and food security due to the ongoing “food vs fuel” debate. An alternative way to obtain ethanol in a one step process involves the use of inulin, a polyfructan that usually has a terminal glucose residue and is found as a reserve carbohydrate in the roots and tubers of plants such as the Jerusalem artichoke, chicory, or dahlia. Inulinases can be produced by bacteria, yeasts and fungi and hydrolyze inulin, releasing fructose and glucose, which can be subsequently fermented to produce ethanol. Although several inulinases have been discovered and characterized, {{there is a need to}} discover new inulinases to improve the efficiency of conversion of inulin into ethanol. The aim of this study is detecting new inulinases from a previously constructed metagenomic library from the marine sponge Axinella dissimilis. The metagenomic library, consisting of 20, 353 clones, was screened for inulinase production using a growth/no growth assay on a minimal medium, containing inulin as the sole carbon source. The 56 obtained positive clones were validated using a dye-linked plate screening technique to evaluate enzymatic activity. Based on this, three metagenomic library clones with the best activity were selected for further analysis. Fosmid DNA from each clone was purified and sub-cloning libraries were constructed and screened in pUC 19 plasmid in an attempt to isolate the inulinase genes. Three plasmid subclones with apparent inulinase activity were identified and their inserts were fully sequenced. However, no putative inulinase genes could be identified despite adopting numerous bioinformatic approaches. Despite this, this is the first study in which inulinase activity was detected by metagenomic approach using marine sponge samples...|$|E
40|$|Candida albicans is a dimorphic yeast {{strongly}} gram positive {{able to live}} {{as normal}} commensal organism in the oral cavity of healthy people.

Clinical studies have shown that C. albicans is not only able to adhere to the mucous surfaces, but also to stick to the acrylic resins of the dental prostheses. Both the plaque accumulated on the denture and the poor oral hygiene contribute to the virulence of Candida, offering the clinical picture of Candida-associated denture stomatitis.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the percentage success and to investigate influencing factors of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) decolonisation treatment in children with cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) who are adopted to The Netherlands. This was a historic cohort study in nine Dutch hospitals with a CLP treatment centre of children who were adopted from abroad in 2005 - 2012 who had CLP and MRSA carriage upon arrival in The Netherlands. A total of 55 adopted children with CLP and MRSA carriage were eligible for the study. Most children were adopted from China and had cheilognathopalatoschisis. Fourteen children were not treated for MRSA carriage, of whom six became MRSA-negative spontaneously. Forty-one children received decolonisation treatment (either <b>topical</b> treatment and <b>disinfectant</b> body wash or these combined with oral antibiotics). Overall, eighteen children [44 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 29 - 59 %] became MRSA-negative after treatment. Treatment success was higher (56 %; 95 % CI 33 - 77 %) {{in the group of}} children treated according to the Dutch guideline for treatment of MRSA carriage (odds ratio = 6. 1, 95 % CI 4. 4 - 26. 4; p= 0. 017). In conclusion, MRSA decolonisation treatment in adopted children with CLP was successful in 44 % of cases and the success percentage was higher in the group of children treated in accordance with the national guideline for treatment of MRSA carriage. However, given the percentage of children who turned MRSA-negative without treatment, waiting for spontaneous clearance of MRSA carriage can be advised after careful consideration of the benefits and risks of decolonisation treatment.
