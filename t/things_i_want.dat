I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E

2500|$|In fall 2000, Norwood {{finally began}} conceiving ideas {{for a third}} studio album with the Atlantic label. While Rodney Jerkins, the main {{producer}} of her previous album, and his Darkchild crew, including Fred Jerkins III and LaShawn Daniels, {{had been working on}} several new songs for the singer's upcoming project in hopes of recreating the winning chemistry of Never Say Never, [...] Norwood {{wanted to make sure that}} she was gaining more creative control over the project and thus, arranged meetings with all her writers and musicians to discuss the lyricals topics and sounds she wanted for the album.
