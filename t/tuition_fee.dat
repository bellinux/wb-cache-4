5|$|The {{number of}} pupils fluctuated {{significantly}} {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century, with usual numbers between 100 and 150 pupils, but falling to eight pupils in 1811 and 30 in 1859. Under the headship of the classical scholar Edward Valpy (1810–1829) pupil numbers increased and the school enjoyed a prosperous period, though its development was hindered by its charter whose trustees preferred to spend most of the £7,000 a year income on the Great Hospital, leaving £300 for the school. Valpy published a popular textbook on Latin style, Elegantiae Latinae (1803), which went through ten editions in his lifetime and The Greek Testament, with English notes, selected and original (1815) in three volumes. In 1837, in the wake of the Municipal Reform Act the patronage of the governors went to twenty-one independent trustees appointed by the Lord Chancellor, separating the governance of the school from the city corporation. As a result of a later 1858 court case Attorney-General v. Hudson the school became independent of the Great Hospital, gaining an endowment of its own and a Board of Governors to administer it. The original objects of the school to provide education for poor boys was abolished and replaced with boarding fees of £60 a year for sons of laymen, £45 for sons of clergymen, and 12 guineas a year for day pupils. A separate school was established to provide training for boys to enter industry and trade called the King Edward VI Middle School or Commercial School.

40|$|Aim: Regarding <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> (that in Germany {{already have}} been abrogated) {{putative}} drawbacks like prolonged study duration have been suspected while benefits are not clearly proven. We investigated whether <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> (500 Euro per semester) affected the course of studies of Cologne medical students and asked for students’ stance over <b>tuition</b> <b>fees.</b> Methods: Of 1, 324 students we analyzed the rate of those passing their first medical exam (“Physikum”) within minimum time and students’ discontinuation rate, respectively. Regression analysis tested for putative influences of <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> and demographic factors. In an additional online survey 400 students answered questions regarding the load by and their stance over <b>tuition</b> <b>fees.</b> Results: We find that fees did not affect rate of Cologne students passing their first medical exam within minimum time or students’ discontinuation rate. According to the online survey, at times of <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> significantly more students did not attend courses as scheduled.

This paper has analyzed to what extent paying <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> of € 500 per semester changed the financial situation of students. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} introduction of <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> changed students’ spending behavior overall moderately. While expenditure of men was not affected, <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> decreased expenditure of women by 5  %. Nevertheless, the absolute magnitude of the decrease was relatively low given that women of the treatment group spent on average € 646 per month, with a decrease of 5  %, thus amounting to € 32. Analyzing the effect on different types of expenditure shows that <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> have a strong negative effect on expenditure for the rent {{for both men and women}} (− 39 and − 52  %).

Resiliency factors predicted academic performance over gender, <b>tuition</b> <b>fees,</b> and hope, and played a more {{important role in the}} academic performance of middle/late than early adolescence. Gender differences were found in emotional reactivity (marginal) and sense of relatedness, with females scoring higher than males in both cases. Finally, adolescents with low <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> scored lower than those with middle <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> on emotional reactivity and marginally lower than those with high <b>tuition</b> <b>fees</b> on sense of relatedness.
