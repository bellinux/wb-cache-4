25|$|Kat {{begins to}} have second {{thoughts}} about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family. Stacey reveals to Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling with money. Alfie then invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but {{at the urging of}} Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find the cash to pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences of motherhood and reassuring her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call from a social worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.|$|E

Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> jokes about.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the up-tempo dance song [...] "Lose My Breath", a track {{detailing}} a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums and keyboard stabs and the backing track contains various sound effects. [...] "Soldier", the second track with T.I. and Lil Wayne, the only featured artists on the album, contains elements from Southern hip hop and Crunk. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover {{from the opening}} song, the protagonists ask for a decent soldier, further singing about finding a gangster. After finding the soldier, the third song, the R number [...] "Cater 2 U", lyrically is about submissively serving the man considered as such.

500|$|Following the divestment, Walsh joined Grand Met's US-headquartered food {{division}} as CFO. In 1989, Grand Met {{used the}} proceeds from the Intercontinental sale to initiate a hostile takeover of Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant and Häagen-Dazs brands, for $5.7 billion. The Grand Met offer was held by analysts to be a generous one for a struggling company that was under-performing in its industry. Walsh subsequently admitted to overvaluing the Green Giant vegetables division. Grand Met was attempting to diversify, and was attracted to Pillsbury's brands, which they believed held under-exploited potential for international growth. Writing in Businessweek, Mark Maremont accused Pillsbury of being [...] "lax" [...] in exploiting Häagen-Dazs' potential overseas. Walsh said: We thought Pillsbury had powerful brands, but it had kind of lost its way. We felt we could leverage its brands and its technologies. They had under-resourced their R and done a number of <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the number, make the number. Cost reduction {{is a way of}} life, {{but you have to be}} responsible about it. You have to protect the seed today because that will be the tree that bears fruit in the future.

500|$|Matsui was {{not good}} at drawing humans or real life things, and {{he was about to}} lose his {{self-confidence}} when he [...] "threw things in at random" [...] to create the series. Matsui mixed his creation with real <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his style original. To create the atmosphere of the series, Matsui used as reference paintings by Rei Kamoi, a Japanese artist he saw on television, and Gōjin Ishihara, the illustrator of Edogawa Ranpo's Shōnen Tantei Dan. Matsui's creative process of art is to begin drawing erotic and grotesque images, {{and at the same time}} humorous and cute scenes. Matsui did not wish to create [...] "terrifying characters" [...] but [...] "funny-terrifying" [...] and [...] "terrifying-cute". He also tried to avoid men's idealized image of heroines and women's idealized images of heroes. Matsui decided to create characters that could exist in the real world and to make their acts and reactions realistic. As such, elaborating on [...] "why people would create such complex tricks in order to murder someone, [...] wanted to convey the extent to which humans will go in pursuit of a goal".|$|E
500|$|Evelyn Waugh's {{professional}} and private circumstances, {{in the years}} after the Second World War, prefigured those of his fictional counterpart Pinfold. Before the war he had established himself as a writer, mainly of light satirical fiction. His wartime experiences, including service in the Royal Marines and the Royal Horse Guards, changed his personal and literary outlook, and put him into what his biographer David Wykes describes as [...] "a mood of introspection... that endured {{to the end of his}} career". Despite occasional reversions to his former style, in general Waugh's post-war fiction aspired to a more serious purpose. In an essay published in Life magazine in April 1946, he wrote: [...] "In my future books there will be two <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them unpopular: a preoccupation with style and the attempt to represent man more fully, which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God." [...] The commercial success of Brideshead Revisited, published in 1945, provided Waugh with the financial means to pursue his writing career in a leisurely fashion. He worked intermittently on his novel Helena for five years, while completing shorter projects and carrying out much unpaid work, particularly for Catholic organisations. In a marked change from his pre-war life, he ceased to socialise and became increasingly concerned to protect his privacy. To this end he adopted an overtly hostile persona as a defence mechanism, to repel the outside world.|$|E

500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel a lot of pressure to add <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
