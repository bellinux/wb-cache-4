5|$|In {{the orders}} that {{branched}} off before the lilioid monocots, the Acorales and Alismatales, flowers differ in several ways. In some cases, like Acorus (Acorales), <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> insignificant. In others, like Butomus (Alismatales), they have six coloured tepals, and so {{could be called}} 'petaloid', but stamens and carpels are more numerous than in the lilioid monocots.|$|E

5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism.

5|$|Several bear {{species are}} {{dangerous}} to humans, especially {{in areas where}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans.

5|$|Tail {{feathers}} of the extinct huia are very rare and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for NZ$8,000, {{much higher than}} the $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most expensive feather ever. The previous record price for a single feather was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a bald eagle feather at auction in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The direct {{environmental}} and economic impacts of introduced C. mutica populations remain unknown. They provide valuable food sources for larger predators, particularly fish. In New Zealand, for example, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> part of the diet of the native big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis). In Europe, wild and farmed fish like the common dab (Limanda limanda), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), consume large amounts of non-native C. mutica.|$|E

5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse.

5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack {{the faces of}} young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E

60|$|Nay, {{the mistake}} of Germany in the modern {{disaster}} largely arose from the facts that she thought England was simple, when England is very subtle.

5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|During {{a welcome}} dinner at Barton Park, Sir John {{introduces}} the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); {{and their family}} friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey). Brandon instantly {{falls in love with}} Marianne, but she believes he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> secretly engaged.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} loanwords for food dishes and their {{ingredients}} are Hokkien in origin, {{and are used}} throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> {{an integral part of}} the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both peranakan and totok, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as high cholesterol levels and heart disease.|$|E

5|$|Oil sands in Alberta have {{a proven}} reserve of , {{the second largest}} proven {{reserves}} of crude oil in the world. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the largest source of oil imported into the United States. With significant economic development and investment into the oil sands, the industry has been enjoying strong support by both the province's government and the federal government. However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} bitumen exploitation. While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{is listed}} as being of Least Concern by the IUCN. There are an {{estimated}} 10 thousand to 100 thousand individuals, although {{there seems to be}} a decline in numbers. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> rare in Thailand and some other parts of southeast Asia. They are relatively abundant in Hong Kong, where the population increased from 39 to 57 birds between 2002 and 2009. A field study on Kangaroo Island in South Australia showed that nesting pairs in areas of high human disturbance (as defined by clearing of landscape and high human activity) had lower breeding success rates. In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, nests have been vacated as human activities have encroached on the eagles' territories. Elsewhere, the clearing of trees suitable for nesting has seen it largely disappear locally, such as the removal of stands of Casuarina equisetifolia in Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh in India. In India, nest densities of about one per 4.32km of coastline have been noted in Sindhudurg and one per 3.57km (45 nests along 161km) in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. They also nest on Netrani Island, where about a 100 birds were noted in 1875 (then known as Pigeon Island) by Allan Octavian Hume who noted that this was perhaps the largest breeding colony of the species. In 2000, the disturbance to the island from torpedo-firing exercises conducted by the Indian navy was noted as a threat. Nearly 100 nests have been noted in 2004 on this island.|$|E
