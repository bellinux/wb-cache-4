Tracing and extracting contour pixels are widely used for smart/wearable image sensor devices, because these are simple and useful for detecting objects. In this paper, we present a novel contour-tracing algorithm for fast and accurate contour following. The proposed algorithm classifies the type of contour pixel, based on its local pattern. Then, it traces the next contour using the previous pixel’s type. Therefore, it can classify the type of contour pixels as a straight line, inner corner, outer corner and inner-outer corner, and it can extract pixels of a specific contour type. Moreover, it can <b>trace</b> <b>contour</b> pixels rapidly because it can determine the local minimal path using the contour case. In addition, the proposed algorithm is capable of the compressing data of contour pixels using the representative points and inner-outer corner points, and it can accurately restore the contour image from the data. To compare {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithm to that of conventional techniques, we measure their processing time and accuracy. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm shows better performance compared to the others. Furthermore, it can provide the compressed data of contour pixels and restore them accurately, including the inner-outer corner, which cannot be restored using conventional algorithms...|$|E

By rendering the contours as distinctly colored polygons and reading back each rendered slice into a segmented volume, we reduce the complex problem of building a surface from planar contours to the much simpler problem of extracting separating surfaces from a classified volume. Our scanline surfacing algorithm robustly handles complex surface topologies such as bifurcations, embedded feature [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} method for extracting the left ventric-ular (LV) {{contours}} from left ventriculograms {{by means of a}} neural edge detector (NED) in order to extract the contours which accord with those traced by a cardiologist. The NED is a supervised edge detector based on a modified multilayer neural network, and is trained by use of a modified back-propagation algorithm. The NED can acquire the function of a desired edge detector through training with a set of input images and the desired edges obtained from the <b>contours</b> <b>traced</b> by a cardiologist. The proposed contour-extrac-tion method consists of 1) detection of “subjective edges ” by use of the NED; 2) extraction of rough contours by use of low-pass fil-tering and edge enhancement; and 3) a contour-tracing method based on the contour candidates synthesized from the edges de-tected by the NED and the rough contours. Through experiments, it was shown that the proposed method was able to extract the con-tours in agreement with those traced by an experienced cardiolo-gist, i. e., we achieved an average contour error of 6. 2 % for left ven-triculograms at end-diastole and an average difference between the ejection fractions obtained from the manually <b>traced</b> <b>contours</b> and those obtained from the computer-extracted contours of 4. 1 %.
