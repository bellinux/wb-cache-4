People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now.

500|$|After his {{departure}} from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante became more serious about his longtime dream to make electronic music. As he explained on his blog, [...] "I started {{to learn how to}} program all the instruments we associate with Acid House music and some other hardware. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> recording, playing 10 or so synced machines through a small mixer into a CD burner. This was all experimental Acid House, my skills at making rock music playing no part in it whatsoever. I had lost interest in traditional songwriting and I was excited about finding new methods for creating music." [...] During that time Frusciante began an electronic trio with Aaron Funk and Chris McDonald under the name Speed Dealer Moms. Their first EP was released in December 2010 on Planet Mu Records.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of Orochimaru {{to the series}} was first suggested by Masashi Kishimoto's superiors {{in order to improve}} the series' popularity. Kishimoto believed the series grew personality based on the Chunin Exams story arc and wanted it to end normally with Shikamaru Nara's victory. However, he eventually accepted their advised and Orochimaru was set up to interrupt this arc. As one of the villains in the story, Kishimoto created Orochimaru as an antithesis to the protagonists' values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended {{to make it easier for}} the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] was one of his [...] "guiding principles," [...] and attributed this to his desire to have the villains have a [...] "powerful aura." [...] When asked if Orochimaru was still good, Kishimoto answered that Orochimaru is [...] "truly evil" [...] and that he is one of the several [...] "hopeless evil characters" [...] that appear in the series. Originally Kishimoto planned to make Orochimaru's look androgynous. However, because of the concept of him being a strong antagonist, he made him more creepy. Of most of the characters, Orochimaru was hardest one to write. Kishimoto wanted wanted him to be a terrifying opponent, so he wondered if that was really the way to go to make him sound strong. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> thinking it was good like that, he's strong and creepy, and the creepyness started increasing.|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E
