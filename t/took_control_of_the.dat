5|$|The {{city was}} {{named by the}} Roman Emperor Vespasian in 72 CE as Flavia Neapolis. Since then, Nablus has been ruled by many empires {{over the course of}} its almost 2,000-year-long history. In the 5th and 6th centuries, {{conflict}} between the city's Christian and Samaritan inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against Byzantine rule, before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community's numbers in the city. In 636, Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, came under the rule of the Islamic Arab Caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab; its name Arabicized to Nablus.
