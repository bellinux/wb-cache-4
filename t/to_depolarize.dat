25|$|Spike-timing-dependent {{plasticity}} (STDP) {{refers to}} the functional changes in a neuron and its synapse due to time dependent action potentials. When an action potential reaches the pre-synaptic membrane it opens voltage-gated calcium channels causing an influx of calcium. The influx of calcium releases vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, usually glutamate, into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane opening ligand-gated channels causing the membrane <b>to</b> <b>depolarize.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aconitine can {{interact}} with the voltage-dependent sodium-ion channels, which are proteins in the cell membranes of excitable tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles and neurons. These proteins are highly selective for sodium ions. They open very fast <b>to</b> <b>depolarize</b> the cell membrane potential, causing the upstroke of an action potential. Normally, the sodium channels close very rapidly, but the depolarization of the membrane potential causes the opening (activation) of potassium channels and potassium efflux, which results in repolarization of the membrane potential.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether accommodation <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> and hyperpolarizing stimuli differs for cutaneous afferents in the median and sural nerves, studies were performed in normal human subjects using threshold electrotonus. The changes in threshold for compound sensory action potentials of 50 % of maximum were recorded when the nerves were subjected <b>to</b> long-lasting <b>depolarizing</b> and hyperpolarizing DC. The premise {{was that the}} threshold changes largely mirror the underlying electrotonic changes in membrane potential. The maximal threshold changes produced by depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents were greater for median afferents, suggesting that the DC produced greater changes in membrane potential in these afferents. Median afferents underwent greater accommodation <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> currents than sural afferents and a greater threshold undershoot {{at the end of}} the currents, suggesting greater activity of a slow K+ conductance. Median afferents also underwent greater accommodation to hyperpolarizing currents, suggesting greater inward rectification. These conductances are voltage dependent, and the differences in accommodation could be due to greater changes in membrane potential for the median nerve. The changes in threshold produced by long-lasting depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents of graded intensity were therefore measured. When the threshold changes were matched for the two nerves, median afferents underwent 22. 4 % more accommodation <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> currents and 28. 7 % more accommodation to hyperpolarizing currents. We conclude that there is greater expression of two internodally located conductances responsible for accommodation on median afferents. The biophysical differences identified in this study might contribute to the finding that sural afferents have a greater tendency to dysfunction than median afferents...|$|R
25|$|Before {{an action}} {{potential}} occurs, the axonal membrane {{is at its}} normal resting potential, and Na+ channels are in their deactivated state, blocked on the extracellular side by their activation gates. In response to an electric current (in this case, an action potential), the activation gates open, allowing positively charged Na+ ions to flow into the neuron through the channels, and causing the voltage across the neuronal membrane to increase. Because the voltage across the membrane is initially negative, as its voltage increases to and past zero, it is said <b>to</b> <b>depolarize.</b> This increase in voltage constitutes the rising phase of an action potential.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{individuals}} with SP, {{there is almost}} no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is much easier for a stimulus to arouse the individual. There may also be a problem with the regulation of melatonin, which under normal circumstances regulates the serotonergic neural populations. Melatonin is typically at its lowest point during REM sleep. Inhibition of melatonin at an inappropriate time would make it impossible for the sleep off neural populations <b>to</b> <b>depolarize</b> when presented with a stimulus that would normally lead to complete arousal. The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep. According to this hypothesis, vestibular-motor disorientation, unlike hallucinations, arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Action {{potentials}} cannot propagate {{through the}} membrane in myelinated {{segments of the}} axon. [...] However, the current is carried by the cytoplasm, which is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>depolarize</b> {{the first or second}} subsequent node of Ranvier. [...] Instead, the ionic current from an action potential at one node of Ranvier provokes another action potential at the next node; this apparent [...] "hopping" [...] of the action potential from node to node is known as saltatory conduction. [...] Although the mechanism of saltatory conduction was suggested in 1925 by Ralph Lillie, the first experimental evidence for saltatory conduction came from Ichiji Tasaki and Taiji Takeuchi* [...] and from Andrew Huxley and Robert Stämpfli.* [...] By contrast, in unmyelinated axons, the action potential provokes another in the membrane immediately adjacent, and moves continuously down the axon like a wave.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} whole-cell patch clamp {{techniques}} to record from tall hair cells {{isolated from the}} apical half of the alligator cochlea. Some of these cells gave action potentials in response <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> current injections. When the same cells were voltage clamped, large transient inward currents followed by smaller outward currents were seen in response <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> steps. We studied the transient inward current after the outward current had been blocked by external tetraethylammonium (20 mM) or by replacing internal potassium with cesium. It {{was found to be}} a sodium current because it was abolished by either replacing external sodium with choline or by external application of tetrodotoxin (100 nM). The sodium current showed voltage-dependent activation and inactivation. Most of the spiking hair cells came from the apex of the cochlea, where they would be subject to low-frequency mechanical stimulation in vivo...|$|R
2500|$|Each action {{potential}} {{is followed by}} a refractory period, which can be divided into an absolute refractory period, during which it is impossible to evoke another {{action potential}}, and then a relative refractory period, during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required. These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the state of sodium and potassium channel molecules. When closing after an action potential, sodium channels enter an [...] "inactivated" [...] state, in which they cannot be made to open regardless of the membrane potential—this gives rise to the absolute refractory period. Even after a sufficient number of sodium channels have transitioned back to their resting state, it frequently happens that a fraction of potassium channels remains open, making it difficult for the membrane potential <b>to</b> <b>depolarize,</b> and thereby giving rise to the relative refractory period. Because the density and subtypes of potassium channels may differ greatly between different types of neurons, the duration of the relative refractory period is highly variable.|$|E
2500|$|Each excitable {{patch of}} {{membrane}} has two important levels of membrane potential: [...] the resting potential, {{which is the}} value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the threshold potential. [...] At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around –70 millivolts (mV) and the threshold potential is around –55 mV. [...] Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane <b>to</b> <b>depolarize</b> or hyperpolarize; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall. [...] Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold. [...] When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time. [...] The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; that is, {{the rise and fall}} usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell. [...] (Exceptions are discussed later in the article). [...] In most neurons, the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. [...] Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second; some types, however, are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} of extracellular Mg concentration, [Mg]o, reduced myocardial excitability and conduction without affecting the resting membrane potential or action potential configuration in ventricular myocytes and papillary muscles {{from a number}} of mammalian species. Although there was a small {{increase of}} specific membrane resistance and no change to intracellular resistivity, the threshold voltage was shifted <b>to</b> <b>depolarized</b> potentials. Thus loss of excitability can be explained by a shift of the activation of inward currents <b>to</b> <b>depolarized</b> potentials, and reduced conduction velocity is due solely to a diminution of local circuit currents. Mgo also was negatively inotropic, the magnitude of this effect being species dependent. Raised [Mg]o caused a small increase of intracellular [Mg] with a small decrease of intracellular [Na+], did not affect intracellular pH, and attenuated the intracellular Ca 2 + transient associated with cell shortening in rat (but not rabbit) myocytes. An increase of [Mg]o reduced the magnitude of the voltage-dependent inward Ca 2 + current, ICa, in rat and rabbit myocytes, and the activation curve of ICa was shifted <b>to</b> more <b>depolarized</b> potentials. A scheme to account for the negative inotropic effect of Mg is presented...|$|R

40|$|Mitophagy {{facilitates}} the selective elimination of impaired or depolarized mitochondria through targeting {{the latter to}} autophagosomes. Parkin becomes localized <b>to</b> <b>depolarized</b> mitochondria in a PINK 1 -dependent manner and polyubiquitinates multiple mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. This permits ubiquitin-binding proteins (e. g., p 62 and NBR 1) to target impaired mitochondria to autophagosomes via Atg 8 /LC 3 II. Bcl- 2 family proteins regulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization during apoptosis and can also influence macroautophagy via interactions with Beclin- 1. Here, we show that Parkin-dependent mitophagy is antagonized by prosurvival members of the Bcl- 2 family (e. g., Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1) in a Beclin- 1 -independent manner. Bcl- 2 proteins suppressed mitophagy through inhibition of Parkin translocation <b>to</b> <b>depolarized</b> mitochondria. Consistent with this, Parkin translocation to mitochondria was enhanced by BH 3 -only proteins or a BH 3 -only mimetic. Taken together with their role as regulators of apoptosis-associated mitochondrial permeabilization, as well as mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics, this suggests that Bcl- 2 family proteins act as global regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{advantages}} of hyperpolarizing cardioplegia with potassium-channel openers versus depolarizing cardioplegia {{have been suggested}} but not demonstrated in coronary microarteries. This study examined the simultaneous electric and tonic alteration of coronary microarteries at the cellular level during and after exposure <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> cardioplegia or hyperpolarizing cardioplegia, with emphasis on endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–mediated relaxation and hyperpolarization. MethodsPorcine coronary microarteries (diameter, approximately 200 - 400 μm) were incubated with depolarizing cardioplegia (20 mmol/L KCl) or hyperpolarizing cardioplegia (10 μmol/L aprikalim) for 1 hour. Cellular membrane potential with a glass microelectrode in a coronary smooth muscle cell and isometric force of the muscle were simultaneously measured in a myograph. ResultsDepolarizing cardioplegia incubation produced a stable contraction (from 4. 9 ± 0. 3 mN to 7. 3 ± 0. 4 mN) and depolarization (from − 51 ± 1 mV to − 41 ± 2 mV). In contrast, hyperpolarizing cardioplegia relaxed (from 4. 8 ± 0. 3 mN to 3. 5 ± 0. 3 mN) and hyperpolarized (from − 51 ± 2 mV to − 56 ± 1 mV) the smooth muscle. After exposure <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> cardioplegia, the bradykinin-induced, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–mediated relaxation reduced from 66. 2 % ± 5. 0 % to 18. 4 % ± 3. 7 % (P <. 001), and the membrane hyperpolarization reduced from 18 ± 1 mV to 7 ± 1 mV (P <. 001) {{in the presence of}} indomethacin and NG-nitro-l-arginine. In contrast, hyperpolarizing cardioplegia did not affect the bradykinin-induced responses. ConclusionsIn the coronary microarteries, exposure to hyperpolarizing cardioplegia preserves whereas depolarizing cardioplegia reduces the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–mediated electric (hyperpolarization) and mechanical (relaxation) responses. Thus hyperpolarizing cardioplegia is superior <b>to</b> <b>depolarizing</b> cardioplegia in protecting the endothelial function in the coronary microcirculation...|$|R

40|$|Myocyte {{function}} and survival {{relies on the}} maintenance of a healthy population of mitochondria. The PINK 1 /Parkin pathway {{plays an important role in}} clearing defective mitochondria via autophagy in cells. However, how the PINK 1 /Parkin pathway regulates mitochondrial quality control and whether it coordinates with other mitophagy pathways are still unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of PINK 1 -deficiency on mitochondrial quality control in myocytes. Using PINK 1 -deficient (PINK 1 -/-) mice, we found that Parkin is recruited to damaged cardiac mitochondria in hearts after treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP or after a myocardial infarction even in the absence of PINK 1. Parkin recruitment <b>to</b> <b>depolarized</b> mitochondria correlates with increased ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins and activation of mitophagy in PINK 1 -/- myocytes. In addition, induction of mitophagy by the atypical BH 3 -only protein BNIP 3 is unaffected by lack of PINK 1. Overall, these data suggest that Parkin recruitment <b>to</b> <b>depolarized</b> cardiac mitochondria and subsequent activation of mitophagy is independent of PINK 1. Moreover, alternative mechanisms of Parkin activation and pathways of mitophagy remain functional in PINK 1 -/- myocytes and could compensate for the PINK 1 deficiency...|$|R
