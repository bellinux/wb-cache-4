25|$|An iwasaka is a stone altar or mound erected as a yorishiro {{to call a}} kami for worship. The {{concepts}} of iwasaka and iwakura are so close that some suggest <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> are in fact synonymous.|$|E
25|$|The {{words of}} the text which {{form the basis of}} the {{deduction}} from analogy must be free, i.e., they must be superfluous and non-essential, or they may not be used (מופנה להקיש ולדין הימנו גזירה שוה). This limitation of the gezerah shavah, however, to superfluous words is not generally recognized. Akiva considers the gezerah shavah valid when neither of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> is superfluous (אינו מופנה כלל). According to Rabbi Ishmael, it is sufficient if the analogy is free on one side (מופנה מצד אחד), i.e., if one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> forming the basis of the analogy is pleonastic. Rabbi Eliezer alone requires both words to be superfluous (מופנה משני צדדים; comp. David Zvi Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim, p.6).|$|E

5000|$|Although {{few or no}} {{established}} dictionaries {{provide a}} definition for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>word</b> term biological adult, the first definition of adult in multiple dictionaries includes [...] "the stage {{of the life cycle}} of an animal after reproductive capacity has been attained". Thus, the base definition of the word adult is the period beginning at puberty. Although this is the primary definition of the base <b>word</b> adult, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>word</b> term biological adult stresses or clarifies that the original definition, based on the beginning of puberty, is being used.|$|R
25|$|The {{first known}} {{documentation}} of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of Dionysius Thrax. At the time hyphenation was joining two words {{that would otherwise be}} read separately by a low tie mark between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words.</b> In Greek these marks were known as enotikon, officially romanized as a hyphen.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonably}} {{complete list}} of uncontroversial so-called minimal pairs can be seen below. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> in each pair are distinguished solely by having different tone (acute vs. grave). In those cases where both words are nouns {{it would have been}} possible to list the genitive forms of the words as well, thereby creating another word pair, but this has been avoided. A few word pairs where one of the words is a plural form with the suffix -or have been included. This {{is due to the fact}} that a vast majority of Swedish-speakers in all parts of Sweden pronounce the suffix -or the same way as -er.|$|E
25|$|Although modern {{dictionaries}} may {{refer to}} Apis as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass asserts that correct usage requires two words, i.e. honey bee, {{as it is}} a kind or type of bee, whereas it is incorrect to run <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> together as in dragonfly or butterfly, because the latter are not flies. Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project. Nonetheless, compounds gradually solidify in the orthography of natural languages in ways that do not always comply with prescription.|$|E

25|$|Qi (or chi) {{is often}} {{translated}} as life energy, referring to energy circulating through the body; though {{a more general}} definition is universal energy, including heat, light, and electromagnetic energy; and definitions often involve breath, air, gas, or relationship between matter, energy, and spirit. Qi is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts. Gong (or kung) is often translated as cultivation or work, and definitions include practice, skill, mastery, merit, achievement, service, result, or accomplishment, and {{is often used to}} mean gongfu (kung fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> are combined to describe systems to cultivate and balance life energy, especially for health.|$|E
25|$|Coordinated {{words are}} {{normally}} written separately (with a comma). If {{the meaning of}} the result is different from that of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> together, but both elements take suffixes, they are written with a hyphen (e.g. süt-főz ‘cook’, consisting of words referring to cooking in the oven and cooking in water, sütnek-főznek ‘they cook’). A hyphen is needed in cases when a phrase is only used with certain suffixes. Connections of words which are completely fused and thus take suffixes only {{at the end of the}} second element are written as one word (e.g. búbánat ‘sorrow and grief’, búbánatos ‘stricken with sorrow and grief’). However, there are phrases that only take suffixes at the end but their elements are still connected with a hyphen, as when words are contrasted (e.g. édes-bús ‘bittersweet’). Certain phrases can be suffixed either at the end of both elements or only at the end of the second element (e.g. hírnév ‘fame’: hírneve or híre-neve ‘his/her/its fame’).|$|E
25|$|In his Dictionarum Duplex {{published}} in 1632, John Davies of Mallwyd differentiated between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> cadair ('chair') and cader ('fort, fortress'), referring to 'Cader Idris' and 'Cader Ddinmael'. That interpretation {{was followed by}} some later lexicographers, including Thomas Charles and Titus Lewis. It is now accepted, however, that cader is a spelling of a spoken form of cadair, {{and that there is}} no evidence that cadair and cader are separate words. But as it represents the pronunciation in the local dialect, the spelling Cader Idris is often seen in Welsh and English, and in June 2016 Snowdonia National Park decided to adopt that spelling on its signage, despite advice from the Welsh Language Commissioner and from Park officers, who favoured 'Cadair'. The local dialect form is also seen in the name of the local secondary school, Ysgol y Gader. The name of the mountain is typically spelt Cadair Idris on current maps. The summit of the mountain is known as Penygader ("top of the chair/stronghold").|$|E
5000|$|Mishing {{derives from}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>word</b> Mi and Yashing. Men is termed as [...] "Mi" [...] while [...] "Yashing" [...] means Fair or Worthy.

The data does not include verbal abstracts ending in -imas, -ymas, -umas (for instance, metimas 'a throwing; a throw' from mesti 'to throw'); 18.7 thousand in numbers (12 thousand of the first accentuation paradigm, 6 thousand of the second), because they can be made from any verb. There may be some inaccuracies due to some specific features, for instance, there are homonyms, which differ only in an accent: síetas 1 – sieve (related to sijóti – to sieve), siẽtas 2 – tether, leash (related to siẽti – to tie, bond; saĩtas – bond; leash), and the possibility exists that in some of such cases <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> were taken as one.|$|E
25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E
25|$|After Quang Trung's death, the Tây Sơn dynasty became {{unstable}} as {{the remaining}} brothers fought {{against each other}} and against {{the people who were}} loyal to Nguyễn Huệ's infant son. Nguyễn Ánh sailed north in 1799, capturing Tây Sơn's stronghold Qui Nhơn. In 1801, his force took Phú Xuân, the Tây Sơn capital. Nguyễn Ánh finally won the war in 1802, when he sieged Thăng Long (Hanoi) and executed Nguyễn Huệ's son, Nguyễn Quang Toản, along with many Tây Sơn generals and officials. Nguyễn Ánh ascended the throne and called himself Emperor Gia Long. Gia is for Gia Định, the old name of Saigon; Long is for Thăng Long, the old name of Hanoi. Hence Gia Long implied the unification of the country. The Nguyễn dynasty lasted until Bảo Đại's abdication in 1945. As China for centuries had referred to Đại Việt as Annam, Gia Long asked the Manchu Qing emperor to rename the country, from Annam to Nam Việt. To prevent any confusion of Gia Long's kingdom with Triệu Đà's ancient kingdom, the Manchu emperor reversed the order of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words</b> to Việt Nam. The name Vietnam is thus known to be used since Emperor Gia Long's reign. Recently historians have found that this name had existed in older books in which Vietnamese referred to their country as Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|Pragmatic {{directions}} provide {{children with}} {{additional information about}} the speaker's intended meaning. Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings. Adults present young children with information about how words are {{related to each other}} through connections, such as [...] "is a part of", [...] "is a kind of", [...] "belongs to", or [...] "is used for". These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words. This is also called inclusion. When children are provided with two words related by inclusion, they hold on to that information. When children hear an adult say an incorrect word, and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word, children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
