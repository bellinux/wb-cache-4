5|$|During 1957, hurricanes {{that formed}} east of 140°W {{were not given}} names by the local warning center. Those that either crossed or formed west of that point were named by the National Weather Bureau in Honolulu, Hawaii. <b>These</b> <b>names</b> {{were taken from the}} names used for Pacific typhoons. Three names were used in 1957, they were Kanoa, Della and Nina. Due to the lack of major damage from these storms, their names were not retired. However, once the Central Pacific adopted its own naming scheme, <b>these</b> <b>names</b> were no longer used.|$|E

5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker {{first described}} the {{grey reef shark}} in 1856 as Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos, in the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus. The type specimen was a -long female from the Java Sea. Other common names used for this shark around the world include black-vee whaler, bronze whaler, Fowler's whaler shark, graceful shark, graceful whaler shark, grey shark, grey whaler shark, longnose blacktail shark, school shark, and shortnose blacktail shark. Some of <b>these</b> <b>names</b> are also applied to other species.|$|E

5|$|Enceladus {{is named}} after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name, like the names {{of each of the}} first seven {{satellites}} of Saturn to be discovered, was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. He chose <b>these</b> <b>names</b> because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Charles Bright and Latimer Clark {{proposed}} {{the names of}} ohm, volt, and farad in honour of Georg Ohm, Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively for the practical units based on the centimetre-gramme-second absolute system. This was supported by Thomson (Lord Kelvin) <b>These</b> <b>names</b> were later scaled {{for use in the}} Practical System. The concept of naming units of measure after noteworthy scientists was subsequently used for other units.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, American {{botanist}} Paul C. Standley described {{three new}} species based on collections from Panama and Costa Rica—Ficus tuerckheimii, F. isophlebia and F. jimenezii. DeWolf {{concluded that they}} were all the same species, and Berg synonymised them with F. aurea. <b>These</b> <b>names</b> have been used widely for Mexican and Central American populations, and continue to be used by some authors. Berg suspected that Ficus rzedowskiana Carvajal and Cuevas-Figueroa may also belong to this species, but he had not examined the original material upon which this species was based.|$|E

5|$|In {{languages}} {{other than}} English, its name also reflects the action it resembles. Sports journalist Alejandro Cisternas, from Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, {{compiled a list}} of <b>these</b> <b>names.</b> In most cases, they either refer to the kick's scissor-like motion, such as the French ciseaux retourné (returned scissor) and the Greek psalidaki, or to its bicycle-like action, such as the Portuguese pontapé de bicicleta. In other languages, the nature of the action is described: German Fallrückzieher (falling backward kick), Polish przewrotka (overturn kick), Dutch omhaal (turnaround drag), and Italian rovesciata (reversed kick).|$|E
5|$|The fungus, first {{documented}} by naturalist John Burton Cleland {{in the early}} 20th century, was initially assumed to be the close relative Macrolepiota procera, a European species now known to be absent from Australia. Australian mycologist Cheryl Grgurinovic recognized Cleland's collections as a distinct species, officially describing it in 1997. The fungus {{has been referred to}} by several names: M.konradii, M.gracilenta, and M.mastoidea. Else Vellinga showed using molecular phylogenetic analysis that <b>these</b> <b>names</b> refer to European species and were misapplied by Australian authors.|$|E
5|$|The two white-tailed {{cockatoo}} {{species were}} called short-billed and long-billed black cockatoos in scientific works, {{yet they were}} called Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoo in Western Australia. Hence ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles pushed for the latter two names to be used. The International Ornithologists' Union has taken up this suggestion and uses <b>these</b> <b>names</b> as their official common names. The local Noongar people did not distinguish between Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoos. Nyungar names recorded include ngolyenok, ngoolyoo (from Northampton), and G'noo-le-a (from Geraldton).|$|E

5|$|Turboliners debuted on the Hiawatha {{corridor}} on June 1, 1975, {{and more}} trainsets began operating in 1976. As with the St. Louis and Detroit corridors, Amtrak dropped individual names {{in favor of}} the Turboliner branding in 1976, but reinstated <b>these</b> <b>names</b> in 1980. Turboliner equipment was withdrawn altogether in 1981. Their withdrawal was the end of Turboliner service in the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|What is now {{recognized}} as a single morphologically variable taxon named Galerina marginata was once split into five distinct species. Norwegian mycologist Gro Gulden and colleagues concluded that all five represented the same species after comparing the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA for various North American and European specimens in Galerina section Naucoriopsis. The results showed no genetic differences between G.marginata and G.autumnalis, G.oregonensis, G.unicolor, and G.venenata, thus reducing all <b>these</b> <b>names</b> to synonymy. The oldest of <b>these</b> <b>names</b> are Agaricus marginatus, described by August Batsch in 1789, and Agaricus unicolor, described by Martin Vahl in 1792. Agaricus autumnalis was described by Charles Horton Peck in 1873, and later moved to Galerina by A.H.Smith and Rolf Singer in their 1962 worldwide monograph on that genus. In the same publication they also introduced the G.autumnalis varieties robusta and angusticystis. Another of the synonymous species, G.oregonensis, was first described in that monograph. Galerina venenata was first identified as a species by Smith in 1953. Since Agaricus marginatus is the oldest validly published name, it has priority {{according to the rules}} of botanical nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Her name {{given at}} birth was Yalurrngali: Peggy Rockman was a name {{subsequently}} {{given to her}} by white administrators. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. <b>These</b> <b>names</b> define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and {{may be associated with}} particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Peggy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.|$|E
