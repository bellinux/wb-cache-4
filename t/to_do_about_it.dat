500|$|Gallagher {{has also}} been very vocal about knife crime. In 2008 he was quoted: [...] "The scumbags are taking over the streets.

When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E

Natasha tries to win her father's favour back and she sprays some unpleasant graffiti about herself around the street, before playing the victim. Natasha enjoys the attention she receives, but when Michael realises what she did, he chooses to disown his daughter and tells her that he does not care what she gets up to. Natasha is left shocked by Michael's decision and does not know what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Natasha becomes insecure following the photo scandal and Michael's rejection of her and she begins to obsess about improving her appearance. Natasha searches for nose jobs online, before stealing her father's credit card and booking herself in for a procedure.|$|E

The inhabitants of Lesnaya Grud' had traveled to Parity and transported the two cosmonauts to their home planet. From there, the cosmonauts send a transmission back to Parity describing the planet. It has a much larger population than Earth, nobody has any concept of war, {{and there is an}} established and functional world government. Furthermore, Lesnaya Grud' suffers from the problem of [...] "internal withering," [...] where portions of the planet turn to uninhabitable desert.
