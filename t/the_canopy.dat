5|$|<b>The</b> <b>canopy</b> hinges open to {{the right}} and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low in the cockpit, {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility from the cockpit is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> to compensate.|$|E
5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> {{and letting the}} sun highlight its iridescent plumage. The breeding behavior of this species is largely unknown, but the range in molting times implies that this species may breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1957 and July 1960 Braham {{commanded}} No. 432 Squadron {{flying the}} Avro Canada CF-100. While {{there he was}} involved in a mid-air collision, losing a wing and unable to jettison <b>the</b> <b>canopy.</b> He ejected through <b>the</b> <b>canopy,</b> parachuting to safety but sustaining back and head injuries. In the summer 1960, the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Braham flew when he could. He would patrol the skies over Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning. His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Early in production, {{the radar}} was {{upgraded}} to the Westinghouse AN/APQ-72, an AN-APG-50 {{with a larger}} radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less claustrophobic. During its career the Phantom underwent many changes {{in the form of}} numerous variants developed.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in <b>the</b> <b>canopy.</b> These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} <b>the</b> <b>canopy.</b> The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors.

5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E
5|$|The orioles are {{medium-sized}} passerines, {{mostly with}} bright and showy plumage, the females often duller plumage than the males The beak is long, slightly curved and hooked.

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|After being anointed, {{the monarch}} {{rises from the}} Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool {{placed in front of}} it. The {{archbishop}} then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is the English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. Once this prayer is finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then bear away <b>the</b> <b>canopy.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought {{to be related to the}} presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse lemurs, such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999, {{high winds}} during a heavy storm {{resulted}} in the dislodgement of some domes in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> over the building's forecourt.

The building's then-owner, the Government Employees Superannuation Board, subsequently initiated legal action against the tower's builder Multiplex.|$|E
25|$|Canopies {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclavesâ€”a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, {{he would give}} his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope {{attached}} to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, <b>the</b> <b>canopies</b> were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished <b>the</b> <b>canopies</b> altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased so much {{to the point that they}} would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making <b>the</b> <b>canopies</b> obstruct <b>the</b> view of the cardinals in the back row.|$|R
40|$|The arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungal {{status of}} the four most common ephemeral plant species, Chorispora tenella (Pall.) DC., Ceratocephalus testiculatus (Crantz) Bess., Eremopyrum orientale (L.) Jaub et. Spash and Veronica Campylopoda Boiss growing in an area dominated by Tamarisk shrubs (Tamarix spp.) was investigated. Samples of the four ephemerals and their rhizosphere soils were collected from underneath and beyond <b>the</b> <b>canopies</b> of <b>the</b> Tamarisk shrubs. Plant mycorrhizal status and soil AM fungal spore densities and community structures were analyzed and compared under and beyond <b>the</b> shrub <b>canopies.</b> <b>The</b> mycorrhizal colonization rates of the ephemerals and spore densities in their corresponding rhizosphere soils were significantly lower under <b>the</b> shrub <b>canopies</b> than beyond. <b>The</b> number of AM fungal species under the shrubs (12) was also lower than beyond <b>the</b> <b>canopies</b> (19). When soil properties in the rhizospheres of the four ephemerals were examined, available N and P and total P, organic matter content, total salt content and electrical conductivity (EC) were all higher under <b>the</b> <b>canopies</b> than beyond. In contrast, soil available K and pH showed no such trend. A total of 21 AM fungal species were isolated from rhizosphere soils of the four ephemerals. Five belonged to Acauldspora, one to Archaeospora, thirteen to Glomus and two to Paraglomus. We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>canopies</b> of Tamarix spp. exerted some influence on the AM {{status of the}} ephemerals and on the AM fungal communities {{and some of the}} properties of their rhizosphere soils...|$|R
