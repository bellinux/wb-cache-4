5|$|A {{unique and}} native form of poetic {{literature}} in Kannada called Vachanas developed during this <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> written by mystics, who expressed their devotion to God in simple poems that could {{appeal to the}} masses.

5|$|During the 1960s, a third-place {{playoff game}} was played in Miami, called the Playoff Bowl. It was contested in early January {{following}} the 1960–69 seasons. Though official playoff games at the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> played, the NFL now officially classifies these ten games (and statistics) as exhibitions, not as playoff games.|$|E

5|$|In June 1970, the Dubna {{team made}} {{improvements}} on their original experiment, providing a purer target {{and reducing the}} intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to find 9.1MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103; thus, the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.|$|E

5|$|Today {{those songs}} are {{classics}} but, at that <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> considered cutting edge. Eventually I realized {{that most of}} them are threaded by the songwriting tradition of our country. They are Argentine songs. The real avant-garde revolutionizes what it inherits. Almendra was heir to the best Argentine music, and combined its elements without prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{was chosen}} to {{participate}} in the 1984 Canada Cup. The roster included eight of Anderson's teammates from the Edmonton Oilers. Canada advanced to the finals and defeated Sweden 2–0 in a best of three series to win the Cup. Anderson scored five points during the tournament. The 1987 Canada Cup also saw Anderson participate. Once more, Canada reached the finals, but this <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> up against the Soviet Union. The finals required all three games as Canada defeated the Soviet Union. All three games needed overtime and had a final score of 6–5. Anderson recorded three points during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> first {{brought from the}} New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Crosses {{began to}} be made between the Arabian horse and the Welsh Pony in Sussex, England the early 1900s, by Lady Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud. She began {{breeding}} Arabian stallions, including Skowronek (1909–1930), a Polish Arabian stud, to Welsh mares from North Wales, especially the Coed Coch stud farm, which she imported {{beginning in the early}} 1920s. Other breeders in England and North America soon followed suit, although at this <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not focused on creating a new breed, and the cross became known as the Welara.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{delivery}} of 26 Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)s during 1942, Romania could only muster 59 R-2/Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)s on 1 April and 30 August 1943, but raised this to 63 by 25 March 1944. There were 44 on hand on 19 July 1944. By this <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> relegated to training duties with the 1st Training Armoured Division.

The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them.|$|E
5|$|His {{impact was}} {{not only on the}} world of education, but also on Argentine {{political}} and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.|$|E
5|$|In March–April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly slow, but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was opposed to it.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded close scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had discovered on show at the World Cup – at the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not available to buy in England.
