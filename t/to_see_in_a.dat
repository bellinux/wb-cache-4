2500|$|In modern cricket the bowler is no balled if he bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot (either {{grounded}} or raised) behind the popping crease and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1950s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease. The 1958-59 series was a catalyst towards the change as fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease in order to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but sometimes they would drag it over the line and they would be no balled. The dust raised by the dragging foot and the distance between the bowling hand and the dragging foot of some six or seven feet made it difficult for umpires to make the correct decision. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease[...] It should have been called as a no ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire and impossible for the bowler.|$|E

2500|$|Predators are {{physically}} distinguished from humans by their greater height, arthropod-like mandibles and long, hair-like appendages {{on their heads}} that are set into their skulls (popularly perceived as [...] "dreadlocks"). Their bodies are resilient to damage, capable of recovering from multiple gunshot wounds and radiation doses which would be fatal to humans. Their wounds do however require medical attention and they incorporate a portable surgical kit in their armor for this purpose. They are also capable of enduring excruciating pain. Predators are much stronger than humans, having been portrayed as being easily capable of outmatching a conditioned adult human male and shattering solid concrete with their bare hands. They are also skilled climbers, and will readily move through trees or across rooftops in pursuit of prey. Though capable of surviving exposure in Antarctic temperatures {{for an extended period}} of time, it is implied that Predators have a preference for hot equatorial climates, and thus making them ectotherms. Their blood is luminescent phosphor green in color. Their vision operates mainly in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum; they can easily detect heat differentials in their surroundings but are unable to easily distinguish among objects of the same relative temperature. A Predator's bio-mask increases its ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of spectra, ranging from the low infrared to the high ultraviolet, and also filters the ambient heat from the area, allowing them to see things with greater clarity and detail. While they are capable of breathing Earth's atmosphere, the creature in Predator 2 is seen using a breathing mask after losing his helmet (Although it should be noted that this Predator had just been shot multiple times and may have therefore not been operating at his full potential). Their dietary habits are also mentioned in Predator 2, where it is revealed that the creature regularly visits a slaughterhouse every two days to feed on the stored meat there.|$|E
2500|$|In modern cricket the bowler is no balled if he bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot (either {{grounded}} or raised) behind the popping crease when it lands (it is still a legal ball if it slides over the line) and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1940s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease and fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but they could drag it over the line and they would be no balled. This proved to be a particular problem in the 1950s. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease[...] It should have been called as a no ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire. Lindwall's action was a text book model, but he was known for his heavy drag. Alan Kippax said that he watched Lindwall for 45 minutes in the Fourth Test at Adelaide without once seeing him bowl a legal delivery and sometimes his foot dragged 18inches over the crease. However, the fast bowler was only called for no balling twice in the series, which Clif Cary thought was a disservice to Lindwall as the English umpires would call him in 1948 if he did not correct his action in time (this proved not to be a problem). Lindwall himself wrote that if the no-ball law was enforced strictly almost every bowler would be no-balled and “the spirit of the law demanded that the bowler should land behind the bowling crease and as long as I did that I was playing the game”. [...] The New South Wales Cricket Association asked him to bowl a yard back from his present delivery, but Bill O'Reilly advised him not to change until no-balled by an umpire and as a result Lindwall kept his action unchanged.|$|E
2500|$|Taki {{has also}} been {{repeatedly}} listed as one of gaming's top ninja characters, such as by Kotaku Japan in 2013.

[...] She was ranked as fifth best ninja hero in video games by Virgin Media in 2008, and included among the ten best video game [...] "ninjas" [...] by Jon Ledford of Sushi Arcade in 2013. In 2010, Game Informer chose Taki as one of the 20 Namco characters they would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rumored crossover fighting game [...] "Namco Vs Capcom", her Capcom side equivalent being Strider Hiryu, adding that [...] "most fighting game characters can’t quite keep up with Taki’s rapid (and annoying) leaps."

PSX Extreme also compared her to Ninja Gaidens Momiji and Gamers noted Kaede from Capcom's [...] to look [...] "like Taki's twin sister." [...] UGO included her on a 2010 list of top 25 [...] "hot ninja girls" [...] in all media and Gelo Gonzales of FHM included Taki on his 2012 list of nine [...] "sexiest ninja babes" [...] in games, comparing her to Solenn Heussaff. In 2012, Rich Knight of Complex ranked her as the fifth swiftest video game ninja, adding that, due to her large bust size, [...] "the only female on this list is also probably the most incredible ninja on here." [...] In 2013, PLAY similarly ranked Taki as the fifth top ninja in video games, described as [...] "superagile fighting machine" [...] and noted as the only female on their list, adding that she [...] "wins the Most Outrageous Ninja Outfit award for garbing herself in nothing but a pink skintight bodysuit." [...] Márcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's GameHall placed her at fifth spot of his 2014 list of top ten kunoichi (female ninja) characters in games.

You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret.

Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field.

Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
