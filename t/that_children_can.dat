5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory {{started on}} June 21, 2004 at Pinewood Studios in England. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman found filming somewhat difficult {{because they were}} simultaneously working on Corpse Bride. The Wonka Factory exterior was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in Batman (1989). The ceremonial scene required 500 local extras. The Chocolate Room/River setpiece filled Pinewood's 007 Stage. As a consequence of British Equity rules, which state <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> only work {{four and a half}} hours a day, filming for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory took six months, ending in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E

25|$|Pinker follows Chomsky {{in arguing}} that the fact <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> learn any human {{language}} with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction. Chomsky himself does not believe language to have evolved as an adaptation, but suggests that it likely evolved as a byproduct of some other adaptation, a so-called spandrel. But Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.|$|E

25|$|On 12 November 2015, the Constitutional Court {{ruled that}} {{same-sex}} couples {{must be allowed}} to register newborn children in both parents' names, with birth certificates listing two mothers or two fathers. In a 5-2 decision, the Court gave the national civil registry 30 days to change its forms so <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> be registered to same-sex couples. The case was brought by two gay men who were unable to register their newborn twins. Local media reports said the babies were born in the United States to a surrogate mother. They reportedly received US citizenship and documents but could not be registered in Colombia. With this decision, the Court recognizes that same-sex couples may be biological parents of children's if procreation is taken for artificial insemination processes. This decision will also have effect for adopted children of same-sex couples.|$|E

500|$|The {{reality of}} Pinker's {{proposed}} language instinct, {{and the related}} claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by many linguists. One prominent opponent of Pinker's view is Geoffrey Sampson whose 1997 book, [...] {{has been described as}} the [...] "definitive response" [...] to Pinker's book. Sampson argues that while it may seem attractive to argue the nature side of the 'nature versus nurture' debate, the nurture side may better support the creativity and nobility of the human mind. Sampson denies there is a language instinct, and argues <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> learn language because people can learn anything. Others have sought a middle ground between Pinker's nativism and Sampson's culturalism.|$|E

While Toriyama has said that Journey to the West was an influence on the manga, Xavier Mínguez-López comments that it is a parody of the Chinese novel, since the stories are similar. He notes that Toriyama uses Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales, the dragon Shenlong who is summoned from the Dragon Balls, as well as characters who are able to come back to life as examples of similarities. Rachel Cantrell {{says that the}} manga parodies martial arts very well, and mentions how Toriyama uses panels to a full extent. She notes that the manga has a coming-of-age theme due to how the story captures Goku from a child to an adult.|$|E

2500|$|Children {{may have}} {{problems}} with bladder control (primarily at night), until eight years or older, and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting.

[...] Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, {{and that of the}} children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than worry about getting up at night to go to the toilet.

2500|$|In most countries, {{students}} use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial {{resistance to the}} idea {{out of fear that}} basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer. There remains disagreement {{about the importance of the}} ability to perform calculations in the head, with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts. In December 2011 the UK's Minister of State for Schools, Nick Gibb, voiced concern <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> become [...] "too dependent" [...] on the use of calculators. As a result, the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the Curriculum. In United States, many math educators and boards of education enthusiastically endorsed the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards and actively promoted the use of classroom calculators from kindergarten through high school.|$|E
2500|$|Piaget {{attributed}} {{different types}} of psychosocial processes to different forms of social relationships, introducing a fundamental distinction between {{different types of}} said relationships. Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is asymmetrical, and, importantly, the knowledge that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form. Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission, illustrating it through reference {{to the way in}} which the elders of a tribe initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group. Similarly, where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child, it is through social transmission <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>can</b> acquire knowledge. By contrast, in cooperative relations, power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more symmetrical relationship emerges. Under these conditions, authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible; each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts, consider the positions of others, and defend his or her own point of view. In such circumstances, where children’s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence, Piaget believed [...] "the reconstruction of knowledge", or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems, exists. Here the knowledge that emerges is open, flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority.|$|E
