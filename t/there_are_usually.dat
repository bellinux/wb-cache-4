5|$|Understanding data {{dependencies}} {{is fundamental}} in implementing parallel algorithms. No program can run {{more quickly than}} the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E

5|$|The larvae have silk glands {{which are}} located on the labium. These glands are {{modified}} salivary glands. They use these silk glands to make silk for cocoons and shelters. Located below the labrum are the mandibles. On {{each side of the}} head <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> six stemmata just above the mandibles. These stemmata are arranged in a semicircle. Below the stemmata there is a small pair of antennae, one on each side.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} has a slender build with a long, pointed snout, large, round eyes with nictitating {{membranes}} (protective third eyelids), and no spiracles. On {{each side of}} the head behind the corner of the jaw, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> seven to 15 enlarged pores. The nostrils are small, as are the adjacent triangular skin flaps. There are long furrows at the corners of the mouth on both the upper and lower jaws. The tooth rows number 2425 in both jaws. The upper teeth are finely serrated and strongly oblique; the lower teeth have a similar shape, though the serrations are smaller and the tips curve gently upward. The teeth of juveniles are smooth-edged.|$|E
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E

5|$|Crucibulum {{species have}} light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, {{known as a}} {{peridium}}, that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, {{the size of the}} peridium may range from 2–4tall by 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth (for C.parvulum) to 5–10mm tall by 5–8mm wide (for C.laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of a single layer of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C.laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, transclucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm. the spores of C.cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is fairly}} large and {{distinct}} and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The {{edge of the}} snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the rostral scale is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> five large plates: a squarish frontal (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two parietals (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow supraoculars. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large nasal scale. The eye is relatively large—equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale—but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small circumorbital scales. The temporal scales are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10–12 sublabials and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) supralabials. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).|$|E
