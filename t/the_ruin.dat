5|$|To {{the south}} of this wall is the {{remaining}} wall of the keep. The mound beneath is formed from the collapsed remnants {{of the other three}} walls. <b>The</b> <b>ruin</b> suggests that the keep was around 16m by 12m, with walls 2.9m thick rising to a machicolated parapet.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. <b>The</b> <b>ruin</b> attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for public viewing by appointment with the landowner.|$|E

5|$|Around 260 AD, {{the fall}} of the Agri Decumates {{territory}} north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to find shelter near Roman fortresses, like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), {{but at the end of}} the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle {{then passed}} through various hands, until in 1915 the Office of Works began discussions with its then owner, Mrs Edmund Bosanquet; {{large-scale}} collapses {{of parts of}} the north-west tower and curtain wall in 1919 contributed to Bosanquet's decision to grant the castle to the Commissioner of Works in 1920. The Commissioners began a programme of repairs to stabilise <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> in its current state.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{the church}} was rebuilt with a west tower, 3-bay nave and south porch, in squared and coursed lias with red brick and Hamstone dressings. The attempt at total {{rebuilding}} ended in failure to collect enough money, despite donations from William Pitt the Younger and Admiral Hood, and a church for the community was built instead {{at the foot of}} the hill (Burrowbridge) in 1838. In the mid 20th century <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> on Burrow Mump underwent some repairs to the north west corner.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{satellite}} site of Akte was <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> that Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño referred to as Tanxulukmul in early 1695.

5|$|The plot of Guillaume {{revolves}} around the common theme of the , a young man who, because of a wager (in the case of Guillaume, because of jealousy) needs to find a young woman's favor. He fails in his enterprise but pretends publicly to have succeeded, causing <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> of a husband (if the gageure had claimed to have succeeded with another man's wife) or, in this case, the despair of a brother. Usually the young man's story is believed at first because he reveals an intimate detail about a young woman, who then has to prove her innocence.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue {{was founded}} in the early 18th century by {{followers}} of Judah heHasid, but it was destroyed by Muslims {{a few years later}} in 1721. The plot lay in ruins for over 140 years and became known as <b>the</b> <b>Ruin,</b> or Hurva. In 1864, the Perushim rebuilt the synagogue, and although officially named the Beis Yaakov Synagogue, it retained its name as the Hurva. It became Jerusalem's main Ashkenazic synagogue, until it too was deliberately destroyed by the Arab Legion after the withdrawal of Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break.

Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E

5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, perhaps {{experiencing}} deliberate destruction in the Late Medieval period, either by Christian iconoclasts or treasure hunters. In local folklore, the site became associated with the burial of a prince and the countless stones motif. <b>The</b> <b>ruin</b> attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 19th century, while archaeological excavation took place in the early 20th. In 1926, ownership was transferred to heritage charity The National Trust. Open without charge to visitors all year around, the stones are the site of a rag tree, a May Day morris dance, and various modern Pagan rituals.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, {{took charge of the}} castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of trust that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E

This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the doubts {{highlighted}} {{in relation to the}} construction of a synagogue, the Perushim, confidently in possession of the ambiguous firman, began clearing away the rubble from <b>the</b> <b>Ruin</b> courtyard in September 1836. As the foundations of he-Hasid's original synagogue were revealed, they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579, signed by Israel ben Moses Najara. After much debate, they decided not to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>Ruin,</b> but initially erect a small structure {{on the edge of the}} Ashkenasic compound. The Arab creditors, however, still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works. Zoref, claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century, was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts. He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid's followers. Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim's favour, Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue. At some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851, he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later. By January 1837 however, the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. In 1854, a second smaller synagogue was built within the compound. The actual plot upon which he-Hasid's synagogue had stood 130 years earlier, however, remained in ruins.|$|E
5|$|The hostility {{between rival}} Spanish factions in Trujillo continued, and Vasco de Herrera {{was unable to}} unite the colonists behind him. He decided the best option would be to found a new town, and {{possibly}} abandon Trujillo. Cerezeda opposed him at every turn, believing this would lead to <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> of the Spanish enterprise in Honduras. Natives working the mines near Trujillo rebelled against their excessive tax burden, killing several Spaniards. Vasco de Herrera seized this opportunity {{as an excuse to}} launch a punitive expedition, but instead marched inland in an attempt to found another colony. The Nahuas of Papayeca rebelled against the excessive cruelty of Andrés de Cereceda under their leader Picecura, and fled to the wilds. In 1531, Vasco de Herrera attempted to bring them back to their settlements.|$|E
