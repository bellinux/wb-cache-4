500|$|In {{the wake}} of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an [...] "aggressive act" [...] that shows no {{consideration}} for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>months,</b> and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get {{through the rest of the}} month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given – [...] "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" [...] encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.|$|E

40|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three <b>months,</b> <b>several</b> new {{components}} {{have been}} added to the ISIP Speech-to-text (STT) system including a Viterbi training module and a front-end capable of generating cepstral features. These features form one complete path to a full-fledged STT system. The decoder has also been reorganized to accommodate the various recognition modes it now supports. The software has been restructured to use more efficient data structures wherever required (such as history nodes to hold all path information). We have also developed a versatile grammar-compiler that compiles any grammar specified in a Bakis-Naur Form (BNF) format into a word graph. The motivation for developing a Viterbi training module instead of the more commonly used Baum-Welch training was that it could be constructed with minimal changes to the core decoder. This module also supports simple model tying and Gaussian mixture component generation and training. The front-end is an independent module that includes features common to most LVCSR systems like cepstral mean subtraction and energy normalization, to name a few. In the previous release of the decoder, N-gram decoding was achieved by pre-constructing a lexical pronunciation tree that spans all the words likely to appear in the hypotheses, and using copies of this tree with different n-gram histories to hypothesize the next word appropriatel...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To assess {{effects of}} 1 -year Intelligent Physical Exercise Training (IPET) on {{musculoskeletal}} health. Methods. Office workers were randomized 1 [*]:[*] 1 to a training group, TG (N= 193), or a control group, CG (N= 194). TG received 1 [*]h supervised high intensity IPET every week within working hours for 1 {{year and was}} recommended to perform 30 [*]min of moderate intensity physical activity for 6 days a week during leisure. The IPET program was based on baseline health measures. Results. No baseline differences were present. An intention-to-treat analysis showed significant between-group effect for muscle strength but not for musculoskeletal pain. However, a per-protocol analysis of those with an adherence of ≥ 70 % demonstrated a significant between-group effect for neck pain during <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three <b>months.</b> <b>Several</b> significant within-group changes were present, where TG and TG ≥ 70 % demonstrated clinically relevant pain reductions whereas minimal reductions were seen for CG. Conclusion. IPET and recommendations of moderate intensity physical activity demonstrated significant between-group effect on muscle strength. Interestingly, significant within-group reductions in musculoskeletal pain were seen not only in TG but also in CG. This may underlie the lack of such between-group effect and shows that a possible positive side effect of merely drawing attention can improve musculoskeletal health...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of nonfatal injury among middle school students in Cambodia and Vietnam. Cross-sectional data from 7137 school children (mean age 15. 5 years, SD = 1. 4) who were randomly sampled for participation in nationally representative Global School-based Health Surveys (GSHS) in Cambodia and Vietnam were analyzed. The proportion of school children reporting one or more serious injuries in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> year was 22. 6 % among boys and 17. 5 % among girls in Cambodia and 34. 3 % among boys and 25. 1 % among girls in Vietnam.

John Beilein is a prominent example of this since his buy out price was so high. Last season, Beilein was the head basketball coach at West Virginia University where he was under contract with the school until 2012. On April 3 of this year, the University of Michigan hired Beilein to become the head coach of its men 2 ̆ 7 s basketball team. Under his contract with West Virginia University, if Beilein left that position before the contract term expired, he was required to pay a specified amount to the university.

40|$|AbstractAquaponics is the {{integration}} of aquaculture and hydroponics. There is expanding interest in aquaponics {{as a form of}} aquaculture {{that can be used to}} produce food closer to urban centers. Commercial aquaponics uses methods and equipment from both the hydroponics and aquaculture industries. There have been few studies of commercial-scale aquaponics production, and the purpose of this research was to document the production methods, crop and fish yields, and profitability of commercial aquaponics in the United States (US) and internationally. An online survey was used for data collection, and 257 respondents met the inclusion criteria for the study. Eighty-one percent of respondents lived in the US, and the remaining respondents were from 22 other countries. The median year that respondents had begun practicing aquaponics was 2010. A total of 538 full-time workers, 242 part-time workers, and 1720 unpaid workers or volunteers were employed at surveyed organizations. The most commonly raised aquatic animals by percent were tilapia (69 %), ornamental fish (43 %), catfish (25 %), other aquatic animals (18 %), perch (16 %), bluegill (15 %), trout (10 %), and bass (7 %). Production statistics, gross sales revenue, investments, and sales outlets for operations are reported and compared to other fields of aquaculture and agriculture. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to study which factors were associated with profitability (as a binary outcome) in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 12 <b>months.</b> <b>Several</b> factors were significantly associated with profitability: aquaponics as the respondents' primary source of income (p< 0. 01; Odds Ratio: 5. 79; 95 % Confidence Interval: 3. 8 – 9. 0), location in US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 7 – 13 (p< 0. 01; OR: 4. 17; 95 % CI: 3. 2 – 5. 5), gross sales revenue ≥$ 5000 (p< 0. 01; OR: 3. 58; 95 % CI: 2. 2 – 5. 8), greater aquaponics knowledge (p< 0. 01; OR: 2. 37; 95 % CI: 2. 0 – 2. 9), and sales of non-food products (e. g., supplies, materials, consulting services, workshops, and agrotourism) (p= 0. 028; OR: 2. 13; 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 4. 2).
