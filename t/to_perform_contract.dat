5|$|The {{director}} of On the Job, Erik Matti, took inspiration from a service driver of Viva Films {{who claimed to}} have been temporarily released from prison <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>contract</b> killings before being reincarcerated. Matti shelved this idea until he ended his hiatus from directing. In 2009, he submitted a short film he directed entitled The Arrival and an eight-minute trailer of On the Job, featuring Joel Torre, to film festivals in an attempt to pitch the project. Both entries were met with critical acclaim.|$|E
25|$|The BA609 drew on {{experience}} gained from Bell's earlier experimental tiltrotor, the XV-15. In 1996, Bell and Boeing {{had formed a}} partnership to develop a civil tiltrotor aircraft; however, in March 1998, {{it was announced that}} Boeing had pulled out of the project. In September 1998, it was announced that Agusta had become a partner in the development program. This led to the establishment of the Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company (BAAC), a joint venture between Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland, to develop and manufacture the aircraft. The Italian government subsidized Agusta's development of a military tiltrotor, and as the AW609 has civilian aspects, the European Commission requires AgustaWestland to pay back progressive amounts per aircraft to the Italian state to avoid a distortion of competition. , Bell continues <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>contract</b> work on the AW609 program while considering commercial potential for the bigger V-280 tiltrotor, where military production may reach larger numbers and hence reduce unit cost. However, in 2016, Bell preferred the 609 for commercial applications and kept the V-280 for military use only. Bell also stated that conventional helicopters were not part of Bell's future for military customers.|$|E

Matti incorporated this experience into a screenplay he co-wrote with Michiko Yamamoto. In 2010, Star Cinema initially declined to produce the film, as they deemed it too violent compared to their usual romantic comedy projects, but by 2012, agreed to co-produce under Matti's independent film company, Reality Entertainment. Principal photography took place in Manila and lasted thirty-three days, on a production budget of ₱47 million (about US$1.1 million).|$|E

5000|$|Though {{hailed by}} some as the [...] "Latina Rosa Parks", Carmelita Torres was mostly {{forgotten}} and her actions had little lasting effect. The Immigration Act of 1917 passed {{just days after the}} riot and imposed barriers for Mexican laborers entering the United States. For the first time in history, workers were required to pass literacy tests, pay a head tax and were forbidden <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>contract</b> labor. Business owners in the Southwest pressed Congress to exempt Mexican workers from contract labor restrictions and head taxes. After the U.S. entered World War I businessmen were able to lift the 1917 Immigration terms for Mexican workers and the exemption lasted until 1921. However, the bathing and fumigations, which later used insecticides and DDT continued into the 1950s. A similar riot the following year was averted when prompt action by Mexican authorities intervened with American authorities. Reports of a typhus death in Juárez were denied by Mexicans and the port and trolleys were temporarily closed to prevent altercations.|$|E

50|$|The lab {{became an}} even more {{valuable}} asset when, around the same time, Hibernia began <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>contract</b> brewing as another way to enhance brewery output and decrease excess capacity. Thus, {{in addition to its}} own product line, Hibernia produced unique beers and private labels for clients who did not have their own brewing facilities. The primary reasoning behind the measure was basic economics: contract brewing kept the brew kettles going during slack periods, and it utilized cooling rooms that had to cool tanks whether full or empty and took up otherwise empty storage space, all the while generating additional income. Contract brewing was becoming increasingly important to the craft industry as it allowed entry to the industry without the very expensive capital investment in a brewery. The venture was successful for the brewery, and over time Hibernia manufactured a number of specialty beers, including Newman’s Albany Amber Beer, Wolf’s Classic Beer and Wolf’s All Malt Lager Beer, Portland Traditional Lager, Malibrew Premium Lager Beer, Griesedieck Beer (a longtime St. Louis staple brew into the 1950s), and Bünd Beer (for a Minnesota firm whose label used a variation of the design for Old Timer’s Lager Beer, a product brewed in Eau Claire by the Walter Brewing Company during the 1970s and 1980s and briefly continued by Hibernia). In each case, the contract brews remained true to Healy’s vision of making only adjunct-free all-malt beers, with recipe formulation done by Hibernia brewmasters according to input provided by clients. Hibernia also provided assistance with the potentially complicated process of getting bottle label approval from the federal government.|$|E

Where necessary, advice from professional offices can be obtained through the hyperlinks established.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWith dwindling personnel resources, {{there is growing}} concern over contract management policies within the DoD as well as questions {{as to how to}} improve contract management efficiency. Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) is responsible for performing the majority of contract administration services once a contract has been awarded. Contract delivery surveillance is an extremely important tool in monitoring production of an end item and notifying customers of potential delivery delays. Unfortunately, DCMC personnel available <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>contract</b> delivery surveillance have not increased proportionately to the contract work load. This study examines the feasibility of contractor self-oversight and self-reporting of delivery delays. DCMC's current contract delivery surveillance practices and procedures are presented and analyzed for effectiveness in notifying the customer of delays. Two case studies on contractor delay self-forecasting are also analyzed. The study reveals that there is potential for successful contractor self-oversight and reporting of delays. As more data becomes available, a cost benefit analysis of contractor self-oversight and reporting is recommended. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to enhance its existing training program for contracting officers representatives (CORs), but the required training does not fully prepare them to perform their contract oversight duties in contingency areas such as Afghanistan. DOD requires that CORs be qualified by training and experience commensurate with the responsibilities to be delegated to them. DOD took several actions to enhance its training program, such as developing a CORs training course {{with a focus on}} contingency operations. However, GAO found that CORs are not prepared to oversee contracts because the required training does not include specifics on how to complete written statements of work and how to operate in Afghanistans unique contracting environment. For example, DOD contracting personnel told GAO about opening delays and additional expenses related to the construction of a dining facility, which was originally constructed without a kitchen because it {{was not included in the}} original statement of work. In some cases, contract-specific training was not provided at all. In addition, not all oversight personnel such as commanders and senior leaders receive training <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>contract</b> oversight and management duties in Afghanistan because such training is not required of them.
