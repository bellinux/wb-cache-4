2500|$|Because Joshua fell on {{his face}} before the Ark, Ashkenazi custom is that one puts one's head down only when praying {{in front of an}} Ark {{containing}} a Torah scroll. Otherwise, it is proper to sit with the head up.cites Rabbi Moshe Feinstein as saying that [...] "because Jerusalem is such a holy city" [...] it's as if we're {{in the presence of a}} Sefer Torah. It also makes a case for [...] "in the same room" [...] and advises [...] "If not, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it sitting without putting your head down." ...|$|E
2500|$|... hen {{you speak}} of us Republicans, you do so only to {{denounce}} us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to [...] "Black Republicans." ....But you will not abide {{the election of a}} Republican president! [...] In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! [...] That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, [...] "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 17, 2012, Luck {{graduated}} from Stanford with a bachelor's degree in architectural design {{and received the}} Al Masters Award, an honor given to an athlete each year, [...] "for the highest standards of athletic performance, leadership and academic achievement." [...] He has stated that his favorite musician is Bruce Springsteen. An avid reader, Luck {{has become known as}} [...] "the Colts' very own librarian", giving and suggesting books for his teammates; in 2012, he said his favorite book was Henri Charrière's Papillon, and he is a fan of Bernard Cornwell's historical fiction. On the field, Luck perplexes his opponents with comments {{that may or may not}} be trash talk: when he is knocked down, he is in the habit of congratulating his opponent on the hit. After a hit by linebacker Ryan Kerrigan that caused a fumble and sent Luck scrambling for the ball, he was not able to congratulate Kerrigan right away and had to wait until later in the game [...] "to tell Kerrigan how great he was doing". Kerrigan's reaction was later captured, [...] "You want to say thank you but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'wait a second--I’m not supposed to like you!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{was filmed}} {{in black and}} white stock on 16mm, in low-light {{conditions}} that stress the crudity of the direct cinema aesthetic. It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of [...] "realism." [...] In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes [...] " [...] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, they just go with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action." [...] Furthermore, [...] "I wanted to show in Hi, Mom! how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise – [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] – and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck 'em in and annihilate 'em. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "It's just a movie, right? It's not real." [...] It's just like television. You're sucked in all the time, and you're being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] section of Hi, Mom! is probably the most important piece of film I've ever done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you do," [...] {{continued}} Olivia, craftily. [...] "That {{is just the}} way in which people form their opinions about foreigners.

6000|$|... "You can {{understand}} why I'm interested, <b>then.</b> When <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you're a plant, you mean you're not capable of mobility? Or do you mean you're a vegetable, {{as opposed to an}} animal? Or just what?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{only thought}} {{you ought to}} be told. I leave it with you to mention it to others or not. Perhaps you will think it best to say nothing until the story gets about. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are aware of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going away}} and it's very {{doubtful}} if I'll ever return; but I'd rather you didn't mention the matter until breakfast to-morrow. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> I've gone to Edinburgh. Perhaps you can promise me that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so, Ki, I {{think that}} I could endure life seated more humbly {{than on a}} throne, though whether her Highness could endure it is another matter. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that if I go upon this journey another will be Pharaoh in my place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} seem to stop the mouth then, Barney, for you call out for grub oftener than I do; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that you couldn't get on without it; so you're a slave to it old boy. I wouldn't be a slave to {{anything}} if I could help it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps I do. Arguments are {{too much}} like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say</b> {{whatever}} <b>you</b> like of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>then?</b> <b>You</b> can't <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> {{love the}} old man, {{or that the}} Ladies Sophie and Carolina Stowte are the women you'd have me choose for companions, or that that soapy, silky, humbugging Lord St. George is to your taste." ...|$|R

6000|$|WILLIS: 'And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Well, this is {{the most}} {{remarkable}} coincidence I ever heard of.

6000|$|... "Then {{what the}} d---- {{business}} have {{you to go}} about and talk to a girl like that? Marriage not in your line! Who cares for your line?

6000|$|Em.: Fate! Nothing of the sort; it’s only me. You men {{are always}} such fatalists.

6000|$|... "When the President {{asks us to}} lunch," [...] he said, [...] "I'll {{say that}} we're lunching with a friend down town, see? Then we'll make a break and get out.

6000|$|... "There, I {{told you}} so!" [...] she said, merrily. [...] "It's {{not the least}} bit of use your pretending you're not in love with him, Una. Why, just look how you tremble!

6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, I should {{purchase}} a large ground sheet, which I might {{use as a}} tent.
