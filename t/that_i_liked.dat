This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked.</b> I remember the first time I saw the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E

While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a half-step and playing the song {{as if it were}} in the key of E, he said, [...] "There was something about the E voicing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked.</b> So it's absolutely, intentionally in E, not E." [...] "Today" [...] is one of the Siamese Dream songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D'arcy's duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality; Wretzky later stated that Corgan [...] "can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20." ...|$|E

500|$|Gunn {{revealed}} that character introductions were the [...] "hardest scenes to crack", with Thanos' introduction {{being the most}} difficult. He felt that [...] "having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [...] {{than it was to}} Guardians of the Galaxy," [...] yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without [...] " [...] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan." [...] To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill [...] "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, [...] "I thought that was interesting, because we’ve had the Other, who’s obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn’t work so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{noted that}} his usual method of {{generating}} parody ideas is to scan Billboard charts, radio play and online buzz {{in order to}} create a master list of candidates. From that point, he works out possible puns on the song titles, the potential for humor and general direction for his versions. Fans speculated ahead of the album's release that Yankovic would parody [...] "Let It Go" [...] from the Disney film Frozen, due to the song's popularity. He later explained that he considered making a Frozen parody titled [...] "Make It So" [...] about , but decided not to after discovering such a parody already existed. Yankovic observed that the existing spoof [...] "had gotten enough attention online to make the Disney legal department ask them to take it down! I couldn't think of an idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> as much as 'Make It So', so... I gave up!". There were several other songs he intended to parody, but felt he was unable to develop a clever enough idea for, and instead used them in the medley [...] "Now That's What I Call Polka". More specifically, Yankovic expressed that while Daft Punk's [...] "Get Lucky" [...] is an [...] "iconic song", it was too repetitive for him to incorporate new lyrics into effectively.|$|E

2500|$|Jones {{always had}} an {{affinity}} for the music of Bill Evans and Billie Holiday, among other [...] "oldies". She once said, [...] "My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> and played {{that over and over}} again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking at the 2010 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, where Genesis were inductees, Collins {{said of the}} album: [...] "You know, I mean, I {{started it}} for fun, really, and just chose all the Motown songs, the darker songs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> the lesser known ones. And I ended up with about 40 of them and finished, I’ve {{actually}} finished about 29 of them".|$|E
2500|$|The initial title, Ruddygore, was changed: {{because of}} claims that [...] "ruddy" [...] was too {{similar to the}} then-taboo curse word [...] "bloody", it was shortly changed to Ruddigore. [...] Gilbert's {{response}} to being told they meant the same thing was: [...] "Not at all, for {{that would mean that}} if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, which I do, I would be saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> your bloody cheek, which I don't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Neill {{starred in}} the {{historical}} drama The Tudors, playing Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. [...] "I have to say I really enjoyed making The Tudors", Neill said, [...] "It was six months with a character that I found immensely intriguing, with a cast <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> very much and with a story I found very compelling. It has elements {{that are hard to}} beat: revenge and betrayal, lust and treason, all the things that make for good stories." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that Reitman was working on a screenplay, based on Joyce Maynard's novel. Talking about the story, Reitman said that [...] "I read it, and I saw the movie in my head. It challenged me in a way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked.</b> It was different from everything else I’ve read." [...] He also admitted that it was completely different from his previous work and said that [...] " [...] deals with a very complex drama. And I may not nail it on this film, it may just be my first step." [...] Reitman wanted to make the film right after his 2009 film Up in the Air, but due to Winslet's scheduling conflicts, he chose to direct Young Adult first.|$|E
2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain things very much. I just tried to coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used to sit up there and watch him when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time. And then I read a book he wrote in 1965 called 'Practical Modern Basketball.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked.</b> Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
2500|$|While at Harrow, Byron became {{close to}} John FitzGibbon, second Earl of Clare, and with George John, fifth Earl De la Warr, and Byron {{retained}} memories of both. Clare {{in particular was}} Byron's favourite, and, after one meeting {{in which they could}} spend only five minutes together, Byron afterwards could [...] "hardly recollect an hour of my existence which could be weighted against them". Byron had other friends at Harrow, including John Wingfield, Edward Noel Long, (grandson of Edward Long) and George, Duke of Dorset, all of who appear in Byron's Childish Recollections. [...] Only Long would continue to Cambridge with Byron. These friendships meant a lot to Byron, and when his friends started dying he claimed that [...] "some curse hangs over me. I never could keep alive even a dog <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> or that liked me". Not all of Byron's relationships encouraged him to stay at the school. Byron's early loves included Mary Duff and Margaret Parker, his distant cousins, and Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at Harrow. Byron refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 due to his love for Chaworth. In Byron's later memoirs, according to Byron's biographer Fiona MacCarthy, [...] "Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings". He returned to Harrow in January 1804. By Easter of that year he had begun to correspond with his half-sister, Augusta. His early letters to her illustrate his earnest desire to establish an affectionate friendship with 'a Friend to whom I can confide.' ...|$|E
