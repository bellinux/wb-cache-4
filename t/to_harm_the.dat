He, Maggie, and Jimmy (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers are stuck. Hershel insists that if Rick's group is to stay on his farm, they must treat the walkers as people, and shows Rick how to snare and lead the walkers back.|$|E
5|$|In {{retaliation}} against Mansur's reneging {{on their}} deal, Salih attacked Aleppo and prevented movement {{into and out}} of the city. This caused severe hardship for its inhabitants and Mansur was unable to challenge the Kilab alone. He thus appealed for support from Basil II, warning him that the Bedouin uprising was bound <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire. Basil II agreed and dispatched 1,000 Armenian soldiers to assist Mansur, but they were soon after withdrawn when Salih convinced Basil II of Mansur's treachery and promised the emperor of his goodwill toward him. Basil II may have actually withdrawn his men to avoid antagonizing the Kilab or, more importantly, the Kilab's Numayrid kinsmen and allies, who posed a more immediate threat to Byzantine territory. In any case, Mansur's position was further weakened as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E

25|$|Early {{clinical}} trials with DMSO were stopped because {{of questions about}} its safety, especially its ability <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> eye. The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and burning and itching on contact with the skin. Strong allergic reactions have been reported. DMSO can cause contaminants, toxins, and medicines to be absorbed through the skin, which may cause unexpected effects. DMSO is thought to increase the effects of blood thinners, steroids, heart medicines, sedatives, and other drugs. In some cases this could be harmful or dangerous. It is a developmental neurotoxin.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years after}} the Norman conquest of England, Exeter rebelled against King William. Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, {{the mother of the}} slain King Harold, was living in the city at the time, and William {{promptly}} marched west and initiated a siege.

However, William quickly arranged for the building of Rougemont Castle to strengthen Norman control over the area. Properties owned by Saxon landlords were transferred into Norman hands and, on the death of Bishop Leofric in 1072, the Norman Osbern FitzOsbern was appointed his successor.|$|E

The few Arapaho warriors counterattacked but were repulsed by the soldiers' repeating carbine's and mountain howitzer's fire. Sixty-three Arapahos, mostly unarmed noncombatants were killed and eighteen {{women and children were}} captured and later released. Additionally, hundreds of Arapaho horses and ponies were shot after the battle.

40|$|The present {{research}} examines moral judgments towards favoritism and discrimination {{as a function}} of personality characteristics in the context of job hiring situations through two studies. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and the Claremont SONA systems. The first study analyzes the effect of implicit theories of personality and perceived intentions <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> on morality judgments in scenarios of favoritism and discrimination. Results indicate lower ratings of morality and higher perceived intentions <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> in <b>the</b> discrimination condition. Perceived intentions <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> mediated <b>the</b> relationship between condition and morality judgments. No significant effects were found with respect to implicit theories of personality. The second study is a 2 x 3 factorial design, adding a manipulation of personality traits discriminated against or favored. A pilot study was used to select the three personality traits for each condition that varied by their perceived malleability. Results indicate overall lower moral judgments and higher perceived intentions <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> in <b>the</b> discrimination condition. Perceived intentions <b>to</b> <b>harm</b> mediated <b>the</b> relationship between condition and moral judgments. There was no significant relationship between implicit theories of personality and moral judgments, nor was there an effect of the personality trait manipulation. However, the manipulation failed to be function as desired, and thus strong conclusions are difficult to draw. Limitations and future research are discussed...|$|R
