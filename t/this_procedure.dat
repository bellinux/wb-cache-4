5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} was {{the usual}} method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas.

5|$|Historically, {{therapeutic}} decompression {{was done}} by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of pain, or a bit deeper, maintaining that pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression {{back to the surface}} pressure.
