50|$|Later, Green’s {{research}} {{extended to}} the RNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses</b> (<b>tumor</b> inducing <b>viruses</b> with an RNA genome). Before reverse transcriptase was discovered by David Baltimore and Howard Temin in 1970 (work that earned them a Nobel Prize), Green wrote a review predicting that the enzyme must exist in the virion of retroviruses. In the early 1970s, he and his co-workers conducted important studies on the biochemical features of reverse transcriptases of avian and murine RNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses.</b> These studies revealed the subunit structure of the enzyme and helped define the polymerase and Ribonuclease H activities inherent with that enzyme. He coupled this basic research to the effort to detect RNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses</b> in human cancer. Tremendous effort was directed to the ‘simultaneous detection’ assay in which proteins are extracted from tumor samples, separated by size, and then examined for reverse transcriptase activity. There was angst associated with those studies because {{of the importance of}} the research and because the workers could occasionally detect weak activity. As was later shown, this activity was not due to infection by RNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses,</b> but rather to endogenous reverse transcriptase activity. These studies were negative, again arguing against a viral etiology of cancer.|$|R

2500|$|Viral {{promoters}} {{are often}} used for constitutive expression in plasmids and in viral vectors because they normally force constant transcription in many cell lines and types reliably.

40|$|Oncogenes {{were first}} {{described}} as the genes of DNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses</b> responsible for in vivo and in vitro neoplastic transformation induced by such viruses. The first oncogenes described were the oncogenes of polyoma, SV 40 and papilloma viruses. The polyoma virus oncogene has been designated the 'middle' T (tumor) antigen, whereas the SV 40 oncogene is designated the 'large' T antigen. The large T of the polyoma virus {{can also be considered}} an oncogene, because it is capable of 'immortalizing', but not transforming primary cell cultures. Other oncogenes of DNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses</b> are the EIA of adenoviruses and the E 7 gene of papilloma viruses. It has been proposed that some of the oncogenes of DNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses</b> act by binding the products of tumor suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma gene product Rb. In general, the products of the oncogenes of DNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses</b> need the cooperation of other oncogenes to establish a completely transformed phenotype. Oncogenes have been discovered in all replication defective RNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses,</b> whereas they are not present in the genomes of replication competent RNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses,</b> which can also give rise to a neoplastic phenotype, in vivo, but by a different mechanism. The discovery of oncogenes in RNA <b>tumor</b> <b>viruses</b> has led to the concept that these oncogenes are actually present in the genomes of all eucaryotic organisms and have been transduced and, in some cases, modified by a retrovirus. The characterization of the oncogenes of acute transforming retroviruses has led to the present classification of oncogenes, which include genes coding for proteins having different functional properties, but all characterized by having some role in the pathway which regulates cell proliferation. The experimental approach of DNA transfection has led to the discoveries of some oncogenes already known from the genomes of retroviruses and also of some new oncogenes which had never been transduced by retroviruses. The knowledge derived from retrovirus research and from the use of the DNA transfection technique has opened a whole new field of science thereby contributing greatly {{to our understanding of the}} mechanisms underlying neoplastic transformation and also to the understanding of normal cell physiology...|$|R
