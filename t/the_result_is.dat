5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> an acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E
5|$|Otherwise, if e is an lvalue, decltype(e) is T&, where T is {{the type}} of e; if e is an xvalue, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> T&&; otherwise, e is a prvalue and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> T.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> disputed by <b>the</b> Salt Institute (the salt producers' trade organisation), {{who demanded}} that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>be</b> handed over for {{re-analysis}}. [...] A re-analysis {{was published in}} 1996 and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> same. [...] <b>The</b> <b>results</b> have since <b>been</b> confirmed by the TOHP I and TOHP II studies.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> first {{presented}} {{in the order of}} data and data analysis; the integration of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>is</b> presented after that.|$|R
30|$|All the {{experiments}} were performed in triplicate and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> represented as mean ± standard deviation. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer comparison test.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a well-lit, well-ventilated, {{windproof}} and {{earthquake-proof building}} that is warm {{in winter and}} cool in summer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> {{equal to}} or better than a result that was {{considered}} an achievement in its field {{at the time of}} discovery.|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} experiments and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{presented in this}} section. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> based on about 100 h of measurements and many hours of measurements preparation.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> {{processed}} with a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test using “Statistica 8 ” program. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> {{presented as}} mean[*]±[*]standard deviation. p[*]<[*] 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{expressed}} as <b>the</b> means of three parallel experiments[*]±[*]standard deviation. Statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>was</b> performed using <b>the</b> t-test with p[*]<[*] 0.05 as the minimal level of significance.|$|R
5|$|The {{second stage}} of {{catalysis}} is {{the resolution of the}} acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Wartime internationals, not {{regarded}} as official matches, {{are not included}} in the list. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> presented with Scotland's score first.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E

40|$|The {{absolute}} {{rate constant}} {{was measured by}} the technique of flash photolysis-laser induced fluorescence (FP-LIF). NH 2 radicals were produced by the flash photolysis of ammonia and the fluorescent NH 2 photons were measured by multiscaling techniques. At each temperature, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> independent of variations in total pressure, and flash intensity. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> compared with previous determinations using the techniques of mass spectrometry, absorption spectroscopy, laser absorption spectroscopy, and laser induced fluorescence. The implications of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> discussed with regard to combustion, post combustion, and atmospheric chemistry. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> also discussed theoretically...|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} section, the {{experiments}} carried out and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> presented. This {{is followed by}} the kinetic model suggested. Parameter estimation <b>results</b> <b>are</b> then presented. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> then discussed and reaction mechanism is suggested. Finally, conclusions are presented.|$|R
5|$|Although Newton {{states that}} the problem was to be solved by Proposition 6, he does not use it explicitly. In the following, {{simplified}} proof, Proposition 6 is used to show how <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> derived.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} {{pyrolysis}} of extruded {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack {{by a second}} substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
25|$|The 1918 general {{election}} {{took place on}} 14 December and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> declared on 28 December, except for the university constituencies. NUI voted between 18–22 December and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> declared on 23 December.|$|R
50|$|In Season 1, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} {{immediately after}} the final challenge. In Seasons 2 and 3, after the challenge, the players were told by the host that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> would <b>be</b> revealed during the live finale, and were secured until the live finale of the show when <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> revealed and <b>the</b> winner was announced.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> split by country; {{the three}} highest-placing skaters from each country formed their {{national}} podiums in men's singles, ladies' singles, and ice dancing. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> among <b>the</b> criteria {{used to determine}} international assignments.|$|R
5|$|Convolve the {{pixelated}} {{image with}} a heat kernel to simulate its evolution under the heat equation {{for a short}} time step. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a Gaussian blur of the image, or equivalently the Weierstrass transform of the indicator function, with radius proportional to the square root of the time step.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any form of mass transit besides bus prior to 2008, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has {{remained}} a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958—a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings. Coupled with the explosive growth of the region and adequate funding, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> one of the nation's most expansive freeway networks.|$|E
5|$|I do {{not think}} Europeans {{understand}} the implications of a systemic banking crisis.... When all banks are forced to raise capital at the same time, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> {{going to be even}} weaker banks and an even longer recession—if not depression.... Government intervention should be the first resort, not the last resort.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> {{announced}} on 4 January 1962, with The Beatles in first place. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> printed in issue 13 of Mersey Beat on 4 January 1962, {{with the front}} page announcing, “Beatles Top Poll!” ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2003 {{municipal}} <b>results</b> <b>are</b> unofficial totals, {{taken from}} the Kitchener-Waterloo Record, November 12, 2003, B8. <b>The</b> final <b>results</b> <b>were</b> not significantly different. Strong also campaigned for municipal office in 1997, but <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> not available online.|$|R
50|$|How far a team moves {{depends on}} how {{different}} <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> from <b>the</b> squiggle's prediction. If <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> close to expectation, a team may barely budge. But an unexpected thrashing will {{cause a lot of}} movement.|$|R
5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is {{to start with a}} single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitions}} using two-legged matches, {{each team}} competes at home once, with an aggregate score {{from the two}} matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule {{may be used to}} determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.|$|E
5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, {{known as the}} Driftless Area, was totally {{surrounded}} by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> an unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> split by country; {{the three}} highest-placing skaters from each country formed their {{national}} podiums in men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> among <b>the</b> criteria {{used to determine}} international assignments.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{displayed}} as a {{bar graph}} using animated HTML segments. Historically <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> displayed graphically in a mixed [...] Flash and JavaScript animation. In previous iterations, two animated stick figures fight on screen after the queries are entered, {{and then an}} animated bar graph appears showing <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> stick figure animation has no impact on <b>the</b> actual <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> <b>results</b> may <b>be</b> comforting, funny or self-referential.|$|R
