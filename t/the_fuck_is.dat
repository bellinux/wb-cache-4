5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What <b>The</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

Kanaan produced his gun, said [...] "Who <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>am</b> I?" [...] and started shooting at Elias' feet. Jamal fired two shots at Elias, hitting him in the buttock. He later described the attack, saying [...] "Fuck Les, I {{shot him in the}} arse. The cops are going to shit. Two kneecappings in the one day, in the same place." ...|$|R
500|$|... 1987 (What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?) is {{the debut}} studio album by British {{electronic}} band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), later {{to be known}} as The KLF. 1987 was produced using extensive unauthorised samples which plagiarised a wide range of musical works, continuing a theme begun in the JAMs' debut single [...] "All You Need Is Love". These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for beatbox rhythms and cryptic, political raps. The album was released to mixed reviews, but was a commercial success.|$|E
500|$|Ritualistic burnings {{had already}} been a {{recurring}} aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut albumThe Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's 1987 (What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?)by burning them in a Swedish field. This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and celebrated in the song [...] "Burn the Bastards". During the 1991 summer solstice, they burnt a [...] wicker man. This was chronicled in The KLF movie [...] The Rites of Mu.|$|E
500|$|The JAMs re-edited {{the single}} {{in such a}} way that—they hoped—"brought [...] inside the [...] "law" [...] but still got up peoples noses", {{removing}} all but a snatch of The Beatles, replacing or doctoring the MC5 sample, and rerecording the Samantha Fox vocal. [...] This new version—named [...] "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)"—was released on 18 May 1987 as JAMS 23T, and was included on The JAMs debut album 1987 (What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?). [...] Indeed, according to Drummond, the recording of 1987 was funded by the sales of [...] "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)".|$|E
5000|$|Controversially, on the Hardcore Remix of the song, {{there was}} a quote: [...] "Who <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> you?" [...] at the {{beginning}} of the track. However, in the Hits Unlimited album and the music video, the entire quote is omitted.|$|R

500|$|In a July 1987 {{review of}} 1987 (What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?), Q {{magazine}} recalled {{that the original}} release of [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] "seemed an inspired moment of pure wildness. Here were Red Clydeside beatbox rappers pointing a finger at society, putting their record together from samples pirated directly from other people's recordings, {{while at the same}} time crossing almost all contemporary music tribal boundaries by including everyone from Samantha Fox to The MC5 among their victims." [...] This was contrasted with 1987 which the reviewer felt was a [...] "disappointment" [...] with [...] "too few ideas being spread too thin".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't know. I have my doubts. Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. If everybody hates it, OK. We have an album we like." [...] The track [...] "Forest Green" [...] was released over a year before the release of the album but was featured on the project with remastered production.|$|E
500|$|King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime was {{recorded}} in Bearsville Studios, in Woodstock, New York. Gould has described the remote location of the studio {{as a form of}} [...] "sensory deprivation". Writing and rehearsing the songs for the album took eight to nine months, although half of this time was also spent finding a replacement for Martin. Recording the album took an additional three months, for which the band hired producer Andy Wallace. Wallace—unconnected to their previous producer Matt Wallace—had previously worked with Sonic Youth, Nirvana and Slayer. Bottum claimed the combination of Wallace and Spruance as two new influences helped to create [...] "a real up-in-the-air, what <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> gonna happen kind of feel" [...] while recording.|$|E

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{technical}} problems on 9 March 2006 forced ESPN2 {{to switch from}} its SportsCenter broadcast to that of ESPNews.

After the broadcast cut to taped footage, Sargent was heard exclaiming [...] "What <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>was</b> that?" ...|$|R
500|$|Unknown to Bakshi, Krantz and {{producer}} Al Guest {{were in the}} middle of a lawsuit. Failing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. He narrowly avoided capture before being stopped by an American border guard who asked him what he was doing. Bakshi responded, [...] "All of these guys are heading into Canada to dodge the draft and I'm running back into the States. What <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> wrong with that!?" [...] The guard laughed, and let Bakshi through. Vita was detained at the airport; he was searched and interrogated for six hours.|$|E
500|$|Moore wrote lyrics for {{the album}} by [...] "mumbling {{along to the}} song and then {{deciphering}} what I'm saying." [...] The lyrics feature political themes ("Hello, Helicopter!" [...] is about the US supplying military arsenals to other countries to protect its own national interests), although Matheos stated that the album was not political in nature. Moore said that he writes lyrics based on personal experiences, and {{that much of the}} album's lyrical content stems from how the September 11 attacks affected him. Moore's brother was a firefighter who worked at the World Trade Center after the attacks, [...] "and I was totally apolitical before this, politically naïve and I still am," [...] Moore stated. [...] "I was like, 'Whoa, what <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> going on in the world?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Musson {{received}} an enthusiastic call in late February from a past member of Plastic Little {{telling him that}} his voice was sampled on [...] "Harlem Shake". Musson {{did not have a}} problem with Baauer using the sample without his permission and found the song's production [...] "phenomenal". He subsequently called Baauer to thank him for [...] "doing something useful with our annoying music". However, he felt that the allusion to the dance was [...] "peculiar" [...] and outdated: [...] "I was like, Who <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> rapping about the Harlem Shake in 2012?" [...] Musson {{said in an interview in}} March that he was negotiating with Mad Decent over compensation and that, although no agreement had been reached, the label had been [...] "more than cooperative during this".|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Flores was co-anchoring ESPNEWS with Danyelle Sargent {{when she}} made her now infamous {{statement}} [...] "What <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>was</b> that," [...] due to technical difficulties.

5000|$|Manchester United {{fans have}} been singing this song {{since the early}} 1980s. In the 1990s it became popular among {{opposition}} supporters to manipulate {{the words of the}} song when playing Manchester United to [...] "Who <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> Man United?", which Man United supporters sarcastically sung themselves after scoring, or while winning, against a rival team.|$|R

500|$|... "Burn the Bastards" [...] is a 1988 song by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), {{from their}} second, and final before {{changing}} names, album Who Killed The JAMs?. [...] The [...] "bastards" [...] {{of the title}} are copies of The JAMs first album, 1987 (What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?), which Drummond and Cauty burnt on a bonfire in a Swedish field after a copyright dispute with the Swedish pop group ABBA. The song (which is based upon Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "Dance to the Music") was released as a single, along with a separate single of remixes titled [...] "Burn the Beat". [...] Both singles were credited to The KLF, marking a change of name and with it a change of musical genre, from The JAMs' sample-fuelled political hip-hop to The KLF's upbeat and uptempo house music.|$|E
500|$|Their debut album, 1987 (What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?), {{had been}} {{investigated}} by the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society, who in August 1987 ordered The JAMs to recall and destroy all unsold copies of 1987, for its illegal use of extensive samples from ABBA's [...] "Dancing Queen". [...] The JAMs journeyed to Sweden—with their unsold LPs and an NME journalist in tow—in an attempt to negotiate with ABBA. [...] When this failed, The JAMs made a bonfire in the Swedish countryside and burnt the LPs. [...] Back in the UK, they continued with their plagiaristic productions, which culminated with a second LP, Who Killed The JAMs?. [...] Its sleeve depicts the 1987 bonfire, and it contains [...] "Burn the Bastards", a sample-heavy celebration of the fire set to house music. Ritualistic burnings became a recurring aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work, including the burning of a 60-ft (18-m) wicker man during the 1991 summer solstice (The Rites of Mu), and, as the K Foundation in 1995, their burning of £1 million.|$|E

5000|$|The premiere at Cannes {{was amazing}} - the midnight screening. They took down two truckloads of audio {{equipment}} from the recording studios {{so it would}} sound better than normal.

It was like snow - it all started to shower down and everyone had dandruff at the end. I remember seeing Terry Semel there, who at the time was head of Warner Bros., sitting next to Steven Spielberg. They were only five rows ahead of me and I'm sure I saw Steven Spielberg mouthing to him at the end when the lights came up, 'what <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>was</b> that?' And Semel turned to me and then bowed respectfully.'What <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>was</b> that?,' indeed.
