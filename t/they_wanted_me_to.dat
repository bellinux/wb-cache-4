[...] "It took me a half-hour to figure out they were giving me distance and direction," [...] Hambleton explained. [...] "No. 1 at Tucson National is 408 yards running southeast. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> move southeast 400 yards. The 'course' would lead me to water." ...|$|E
500|$|The band also {{recorded}} interludes with Primus bass player and singer Les Claypool and MTV VJ Matt Pinfield. Claypool stated, [...] "I {{came in and}} <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write some sort of intro for the record. I got stoned and got {{in front of the}} mic and started babbling and they ended up not using the intro and using that instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Ghostshrimp, a {{background}} artist {{who worked on}} the series during seasons one through four, also returned to draw around 70 background pieces for this miniseries. Ghostshrimp, who had left the series during the middle of season four, noted: [...] "I was super pumped that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> work on it, [...] it was great to return to that world for another go around." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Immediately {{after the}} failure of the Camp David , I met him in Paris upon his return.... Camp David had failed, and he said <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'You should remain in Paris.' I asked him why, and he said, 'Because I am going to start an intifada. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> betray the Palestinian cause. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give up on our principles, and I will not do so,'" [...] the {{research}} institute [...] translated Suha as saying.|$|R
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Ashmore stated that [...] "I think Veronica Mars {{is a great}} show, so if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to,</b> I would love to [...] I love the show, and I love the {{character}} of Troy, too." [...] However, the character would {{not return to the}} show after [...] "The Rapes of Graff". [...] "The Rapes of Graff" [...] also includes the final appearance of recurring character Hannah Griffith (Jessy Schram), who appeared in a total of four episodes on the show.|$|E
500|$|I got a call, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{be a part}} of that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain thanked his teammates. [...] "It wouldn't {{even have}} been close to {{possible}} without them. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get it as much I did." [...] He added, [...] "They had {{to do more than}} just give up open shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic." [...] Knicks' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game. Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain, Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally, Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100. Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks [...] "had played straight-up basketball." [...] New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested, [...] "The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them." [...] The Knicks' Naulls stated, [...] "The game was not a fluke ... I thought it was absolutely authentic." [...] Imhoff said Zinkoff's announcements did not help the Knicks' cause.|$|E

500|$|Julia Stanley married Alfred ("Alf" [...] or [...] "Fred") Lennon on 3 December 1938, and on 9 October 1940, the couple's {{first and}} only child was born. Mimi phoned the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital that evening {{and was told that}} Julia had given birth to a boy. According to Mimi, she went {{straight}} to the hospital during the middle of an air raid, and was forced to hide in doorways to avoid the shrapnel. She ran, as she later recalled, [...] "as fast as my legs could carry me". When a parachute-borne landmine fell outside the hospital, she later said, [...] "My sister [...] stayed in bed, and they put the baby [...] under the bed. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go into the basement, but I wouldn't. I ran {{all the way back to}} Newcastle Road to tell father [...] the news. 'Get under the shelter,' the wardens were shouting. 'Oh, be quiet,' I told them." [...] The story about the air-raid has since been repudiated, as there was no attack that night. The previous raid had been on 21–22 September, and the next was on 16 October, when the areas of Walton and Everton were badly hit.|$|E
500|$|Alcorn {{publicly}} revealed her {{attraction to}} males {{when she was}} sixteen, as she believed that identifying as a gay male at that point would be a stepping stone to coming out as transgender at a later date. According to a childhood friend, Alcorn received a positive reception from many at Kings High School, although her parents were appalled. In Alcorn's words, [...] "They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted." [...] They removed her from the school, and enrolled her as an eleventh grader at an online school, Ohio Virtual Academy. According to Alcorn, her parents cut her off {{from the outside world}} for five months as they denied her access to social media and many forms of communication. She described this as a significant contributing factor towards her suicide. At {{the end of the school}} year, they returned her phone to her and allowed her to regain contact with her friends, although by this time – according to Alcorn – her relationship with many of them had become strained and she continued to feel isolated.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{upon her}} arrival at Seattle Grace, plastic surgeon Mark Sloan {{was seen to}} develop {{feelings}} for Hahn, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. The character explained that she kept her personal and professional lives separate, but as Smith has explained: [...] "She came to the wrong hospital if she thought she wasn’t {{going to have a}} personal life!" [...] Smith has admitted to eavesdropping on a writers’ meeting in an attempt {{to find out what was}} in store for her character romantically, as it was being closely guarded, even from her. She discussed with TV Guide editor Michael Ausiello early in her tenure as Hahn how she and Sandra Oh had pushed for a lesbian relationship between Hahn and Cristina, having previously played lovers in the play Stop Kiss. She agreed with Ausiello's assessment that Hahn would make an [...] "awesome lesbian" [...] and that: [...] "I've certainly let [...] know I'm open to it. [...] They were like, [...] "OK, duly noted!" [...] I think <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> shut up already." [...] Equally, however, Smith has revealed that when she and Shonda Rhimes first discussed the possibility of Hahn being gay; [...] ""we felt it was too obvious that a strong, powerful woman would be a lesbian".|$|E

500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011. He was later {{selected}} by the Halifax Rainmen as the 13th overall pick {{in the second round of}} the 2011 NBL Canada draft. He made his professional debut with the Rainmen on November 3, 2011, scoring 6 points and recording 4 rebounds in a loss to the London Lightning. Through the next seven games, he saw very limited playing time, spending over 10 minutes on the court in just three contests. After averaging three points per game, Oppong was released by Halifax in early December 2011. Nevertheless, he still drew the attention of Gary Durrant, the director of basketball operations for the Oshawa Power, who pursued Oppong in the draft combine itself. Oppong said, [...] "Gary actually called my agent and said <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come back to take another look at me. They liked me and it worked out." [...] He was pleased at the idea of joining the Power because of it was located very close to his hometown as well. Oppong made his first appearance for Oshawa on January 12, 2012, but was scoreless with 3 personal fouls vs the Summerside Storm. He scored a season-best 10 points on January 29, lifting his team to a victory over the Moncton Miracles.|$|E
500|$|Ron Swanson {{was created}} by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, {{although}} Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation. Offerman said in July 2012 that [...] "NBC really resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every other guy in the country, and then they finally acquiesced." [...] The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job [...] [...] [...] I'm aware of the irony." [...] Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing. Ron's signature mustache {{was one of the}} first ideas conceived for the character. Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: [...] "I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a feeling}} that I shall," [...] said Mr. Stiles, {{crossing}} glances with his friend. [...] "The only thing is my people; <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> join them at Lord Tufton’s place." ...|$|R

2500|$|On December 8, Andy Pettitte, {{who signed}} with the Astros in 2003, {{announced}} {{that he will be}} returning to the Yankees accepting a 1-year $16 million contract with player option year also worth $16million if picked up. [...] "It shocked me that [...] would not continue to go up, when the Yankees continued to push and push and pursue and they [...] really didn't do much", Pettitte said. [...] "It was a full-court press by the Yankees. I've talked to the guys, and obviously <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come back up there." [...] The Astros reportedly offered a one-year $12million contract but would not offer a player option for another year.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on his {{decision}} to retire years later, Richardson remarked [...] "I resigned and retired because I was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, I was burnt out {{and it was a}} struggle to continue playing cricket. Every day was stressful, everybody wanted a piece of you and I had no time for myself. I was training harder and trying hard on the field but I couldn't do what I wanted to do. I felt like I was selling myself and my fans short. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> continue, but if I had have I would have got ill so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-three of the accusers {{are being}} {{represented}} by attorney Gloria Allred, and one accuser, Janice Dickinson, {{is represented by}} Allred's daughter, Lisa Bloom. On December 11, 2015 Allred stated {{in an interview with}} Victor Fiorillo that more alleged victims would be coming forward: [...] "More women have contacted me who have not yet spoken out publicly, some of whom may do so in the future and some of whom have chosen not to do so. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know the information that they had so it would be of assistance to us and our victim. There are definitely more women who wish to speak out in the future who allege that they are victims of Mr. Cosby." ...|$|E

There was no way I was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by ... I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do, and all the while continuing to burrow my way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why."(ibid., 164) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, Real Madrid wanted to sell Van der Vaart, but the player decided to stay in Madrid because his wife was {{undergoing}} cancer treatment there. A year later, upon his move to England, Van der Vaart stated, [...] "She had a very serious illness {{and it is true}} that she had to be treated at the Clinica Quiron. Last season, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> leave but I couldn't leave for that reason. Now she is well {{and the only thing that}} happened was that Madrid wanted to sell and I wanted to get back to enjoying playing football, and Tottenham are a great team that are going to give me the football opportunities that I need." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Pentagon chief {{prosecutor}} Colonel Morris Davis, who had {{resigned from the}} US defence force citing dissatisfaction with the Guantanamo military commission process, alleged that the process had become highly politicised {{and that he had}} felt [...] "pressured to do something less than full, fair and open". Davis later elaborated, saying that the Hicks trial was flawed and appeared rushed for the political benefit of the Howard government in Australia. Davis said of his former superiors that [...] "there is no question <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stage show trials {{that have nothing to do}} with the centuries-old tradition of military justice in America". On 28 April 2008, while testifying at a pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo for Salim Hamdan, Colonel Davis said that he had [...] "inherited" [...] the Hicks case but did not consider it serious enough to warrant prosecution.|$|E
