25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E

He told the Commons, [...] "We have now finished the story of Bleak House and are sitting down <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> to enjoy {{the first chapter of}} Great Expectations."

500|$|Chamberlain {{hoped that}} a {{cancellation}} of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference. The Conference came to nothing. US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word {{that he would not}} consider any war debt cancellation. By 1934, Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and restore many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office.

I lost it yesterday in Austin. <b>This</b> <b>afternoon</b> I'm getting a new one!" [...] Ormond Simkins first ran in a touchdown from the 1-yard-line {{near the end of}} the first half. Quarterback Warbler Wilson got the second touchdown with five seconds left in the game.

Jim says, [...] "I {{have a lot of work}} to do <b>this</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Those mines aren't going to sweep themselves," [...] a reference to the computer game Minesweeper. Ryan is said to be [...] "sleeping with random prostitutes" [...] in Thailand; prostitution in the Southeast Asian nation is technically illegal, but is in practice tolerated and regulated.

500|$|In September 1976, Alston {{announced}} that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. At a press conference, Alston said, [...] "I've been in baseball for 41 years and it's been awfully good to me. This has been a pretty big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in my life and now I'm announcing that I'm stepping down as manager. I told Peter <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> to give somebody else a chance to manage the club." [...] Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason). Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.|$|E

500|$|On October 19, 1875, Grant {{made another}} {{reforming}} cabinet choice when he appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior. Chandler immediately {{went to work}} reforming the Interior Department by dismissing all the important clerks in the Patent Office. Chandler had discovered that during Delano's tenure, money had been paid to fictitious clerks while other clerks had been paid without performing any services. Chandler next turned to the Department of Indian Affairs to reform another Delano debacle. President Grant ordered Chandler to fire everyone, saying, [...] "Have those men dismissed by 3 o'clock <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> or shut down the bureau." [...] Chandler did exactly as Grant had ordered. Chandler also banned bogus agents, known as [...] "Indian Attorneys," [...] who had been paid $8.00 a day plus expenses for, ostensibly, providing tribes with representation in the nation's capital. [...] Many of these agents were unqualified and swindled the Native American tribes into believing they had a voice in Washington.|$|E
500|$|With light {{vertical}} {{wind shear}} and warm water temperatures, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on August19 that [...] "hurricane status {{would probably be}} attained <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> or tonight." [...] Its track was expected to continue generally west-northwestward, influenced by a ridge near the Bahamas, and within 60hours Dorothy was forecast to be north or over Puerto Rico. However, a subsequent Hurricane Hunters flight reported a more westerly motion, which would bring its track through the central Lesser Antilles. Tropical Storm Dorothy gradually intensified, reaching peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) on August20 just east-northeast of Barbados. Hurricane Hunters confirmed the intensity, though the flight also reported a weakness of low-level inflow. Despite maintaining winds of just below hurricane-force, {{there was no evidence}} of an eyewall on radars as the storm approached the Lesser Antilles. Late on August20, the storm moved across Martinique into the Caribbean Sea, during which its low-level circulation became disorganized.|$|E

[...] A similar statement was shown on its web site's home page. [...] Westroads Mall also stated on its web site, [...] "Our thoughts and prayers remain with all affected by this tragedy." [...] Its home page also indicated that the mall would remain closed until the following Saturday, December 8; however, the Von Maur store, where the incident took place, did not open until December 20. In the days following the tragedy, the Von Maur store was thronged on all sides by flowers and signs expressing condolences, as makeshift memorials to the victims. By January 12, 2008, a fund for the victims' families surpassed one million dollars.|$|E

500|$|Four battalions of rebel troops moved {{before dawn}} from the Mekong Delta towards Saigon, using armored {{personnel}} carriers and jeeps carrying machine guns. After cowing several police checkpoints {{on the edge of}} the capital with threats of machine-gun and artillery fire, the plotters put rebel sentries in their place to seal off Saigon from incoming or outgoing traffic. They then captured communication facilities in the capital, including the post office, to prevent messages from being sent in or out. As his troops took over the city, Phát sat in a civilian vehicle and placidly said [...] "We'll be holding a press conference in town <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> at 4 p.m." [...] He said [...] "This is nothing to worry about. Just a little operation against some politicians." [...] The rebels set up their command post in the Saigon home of General Duong Ngoc Lam, who had been removed from his post as Mayor of Saigon by Khánh. Lam had commanded the Civil Guard during Diệm's presidency and was one of his trusted supporters.|$|E
500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E

As the rebel troops took over the city without any firing and sealed it off, Phát sat in a civilian vehicle and calmly said, [...] "We'll be holding a press conference in town <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> at 4 p.m." [...] Claiming to represent The Council for the Liberation of the Nation, Phát proclaimed the deposal of Khánh's [...] "junta" [...] over national radio, and accused Khánh of promoting conflict within the nation's military and political leadership. He promised to capture Khánh and pursue a policy of increased anti-communism, stronger government and military. Phát stated he would return to the crypto-fascist, Catholic integrist ideology of the Ngô family to lay the foundation for his junta. According to historian George McTurnan Kahin, Phát's broadcast was [...] "triumphant" [...] and may have prompted senior officers who were neither part of the original conspiracy nor fully loyal to Khánh to conclude that Phát and Đức would not embrace them if they rallied to their side.|$|E
