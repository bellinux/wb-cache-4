The new headquarters—at the corner of North Capitol Street NE and L Street NW—is in the burgeoning NoMa neighborhood of Washington.

The political atmosphere in Ogun State went ecstatic as every political party sat up. Series of politicking started all over the state, Ogun State politics became <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>nation.</b> Everywhere he went for rally, mammoth crowd always gather to declare their support. It was becoming glaring that Labour Party might win the election for 2015. While skeptic analysis said {{it was an act of}} desperation for him to have left PDP for Labour Party but majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Ogun State didn't care, they started declaring their support for him. He became <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masses speaking against unhealthy projects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state government.|$|R
40|$|Since <b>the</b> reforms <b>of</b> 1991, <b>the</b> inflow <b>of</b> FDI in India {{has been}} growing and its impact {{can be seen on}} <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy on the whole. <b>The</b> main {{objective}} <b>of</b> this is research is to view <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> various Indian and foreign companies on impact of FDI in India and how they perceive India as an investment destination. As <b>the</b> focal area <b>of</b> discussion is India, we firstly <b>talk</b> about traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> before and after the reforms. In the literature review section we talk about <b>the</b> various theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FDI as well as the FDI trends that we have been witnessing in India as well globally. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis is based on the data collected from the questionnaire survey conducted. The study discuss <b>the</b> various determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host country that influences foreign investors to make their decision on bringing FDI into the country, also we discuss how these various determinant have evolved since <b>the</b> entrance <b>of</b> liberalization of FDI policy. And lastly, we have also taken the Indian company perspective on their feeling regarding <b>the</b> abundance <b>of</b> FDI coming into the country...|$|R
60|$|I {{have said}} that {{religion}} in the States is rowdy. By that I mean to imply {{that it seems to}} me to be divested of that reverential order and strictness of rule which, according to our ideas, should be attached to matters of religion. One hardly knows where <b>the</b> affairs <b>of</b> this world end, or where those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next begin. When the holy men were had in at the lecture, were they doing stage-work or church-work? On hearing sermons, one is often driven to ask one's self whether the discourse from the pulpit be in its nature political or religious. I heard an Episcopalian Protestant clergyman <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scoffing <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> Europe, because at that moment he was angry with England and France about Slidell and Mason. I have heard a chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bible read in Congress at <b>the</b> desire <b>of</b> a member, and very badly read. After which the chapter itself and <b>the</b> reading <b>of</b> it became a subject of debate, partly jocose and partly acrimonious. It is a common thing for a clergyman to change his profession and follow any other pursuit. I know two or three gentlemen who were once in that line of life, but have since gone into other trades. There is, I think, an unexpressed determination on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people to abandon all reverence, and to regard religion from an altogether worldly point of view. They are willing to have religion, as they are willing to have laws; but they choose to make it for themselves. They do not object to pay for it, but they like to have <b>the</b> handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article for which they pay. As <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> Puritans and other godly Protestants, they will submit to religious teaching, but as republicans they will have no priestcraft. The French at their revolution had the latter feeling without the former, and were therefore consistent with themselves in abolishing all worship. The Americans desire to do the same thing politically, but infidelity has had no charms for them. They say their prayers, and then seem to apologize for doing so, as though it were hardly <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> a free and enlightened citizen, justified in ruling himself as he pleases. All this to me is rowdy. I know no other word by which I can so well describe it.|$|R

50|$|Haydon's {{autobiography}} is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most natural}} books ever written, full of various and abundant power, and fascinating to the reader. His {{love for his}} art was both a passion and a principle. He found patrons difficult to manage; {{and did not have}} the tact to lead them gently. He failed, abused patrons and patronage, and intermingled <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noblest independence with acts not always dignified. He was self-willed to perversity, but his perseverance was such as is seldom associated with so much vehemence and passion. He had confidence in his own powers and in <b>the</b> ultimate triumph <b>of</b> art. He proclaimed himself the apostle and martyr of high art, and believed himself to have a claim on the sympathy and support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The next day, the {{situation}} in Ryesgade had become the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> The national news broadcasters canceled shows in order to transmit live updates on {{the situation}}. Most elements of the press were very critical and hateful towards the squatters and their supporters. Headlines calling the squatters [...] "a bunch of terrorists" [...] and [...] "masked maniacs" [...] were common. The squatters found themselves facing a horde of journalists, all shouting questions and demanding answers from the defenders. The tone of the coverage angered the squatters, and they at first {{refused to talk to}} the press. But when the squatters found that they might be facing a prolonged siege, they eventually decided to address the media.|$|E

[...] The story called the affair [...] "a low {{point in the}} 152-year history of the newspaper." [...] On the NPR radio show <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation,</b> Blair explained that his fabrications started with {{what he thought was}} a relatively innocent infraction: using a quote from a press conference which he had missed. He described a gradual process whereby his ethical violations became worse, and contended that his main motivation was a fear of not living up to the expectations that he and others had for his career.|$|E

Stephanie Gutmann of The Daily Telegraph wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the 2010 Times Square car bomb attempt {{was found to be}} related to the South Park episode [...] "200", [...] "this sort of protest will be more important than ever." [...] Writing for The Faster Times, journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, [...] "was her way of supporting the show’s creators and the First Amendment."

6000|$|Christ {{knew how}} to preach to these simple, superstitious, disease-tortured creatures: He healed the sick. They flocked to our poor human doctor this morning when the fame {{of what he had}} done to the sick child went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with their eyes while they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in his simples or not. The {{ancestors}} of these--people precisely like them in color, dress, manners, customs, simplicity--flocked in vast multitudes after Christ, and when they saw Him make the afflicted whole with a word, it is no wonder they worshiped Him. No wonder His deeds were the <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> No wonder the multitude that followed Him was so great that at one time--thirty miles from here--they had to let a sick man down through the roof because no approach could be made to the door; no wonder His audiences were so great at Galilee that He had to preach from a ship removed a little distance from the shore; no wonder that even in the desert places about Bethsaida, five thousand invaded His solitude, and He had to feed them by a miracle or else see them suffer for their confiding faith and devotion; no wonder when there was a great commotion in a city in those days, one neighbor explained it to another in words to this effect: [...] "They say that Jesus of Nazareth is come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|What evil results now to this country, {{taken at}} large, {{from the actual}} {{existence}} of the National Debt? I never could get a plain and practical answer to that question. I do not advert to the past loss of capital, although {{it is hard to}} see how that capital can be said to have been unproductive, which produces, in the defence of the nation itself, the conditions of the permanence and productivity of all other capital. As to taxation to pay the interest, how can the country suffer by a process, under which the money is never one minute out of the pockets of the people? You may just as well say that a man is weakened by the circulation of his blood. There may, certainly, be particular local evils and grievances resulting from the mode of taxation or collection; but how can that debt be in any proper sense a burthen to the nation, which the nation owes to itself, and to no one but itself? It is a juggle to <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> owing the capital or the interest to the stockholders; it owes to itself only. Suppose the interest to be owing to the Emperor of Russia, and then you would feel the difference of a debt in the proper sense. It is really and truly nothing more in effect than so much moneys or money's worth, raised annually by the state for the purpose of quickening industry.[1] ...|$|E
