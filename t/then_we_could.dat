After the previsualizations, live action portions of the scene would be filmed in small pieces. [...] "If say Superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away, we would shoot our start position and end position, and then bridge that gap with the CG takeovers," [...] says Guillaume Rocheron, the MPC visual effects supervisor. A camera rig would then obtain key frames of the choreographed actor. [...] "It's a six-still camera rig that's built on a pipe rig {{so that you can}} run it in {{at the end of a}} setup and get stills of key frames of a performance or an expression," [...] said Desjardin, [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use those hi-res stills to project onto the CG double and get really accurate transition lighting and color—right from the set." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B. He considered the episode [...] "entertaining to watch" [...] with [...] "nifty direction from Tucker Gates", despite being formulaic {{and with the}} same problems he found in the previous episode penned by John Shiban, season three's [...] "Teso Dos Bichos". Handlen had much praise for the second half, which he noted was filled with dark humor, and featured a [...] "bizarre ending". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it a 2 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode is a disastrous combination of political commentary and stereotypical “Mexican soap opera” caricatures. Mulder and Scully {{have nothing to do}} with the resolution of the episode, and in fact, the writers fail to provide that resolution. There are some good character moments, but they are too far and few between." [...] Author Keith Topping criticized the episode in his book X-Treme Possibilities, calling it an [...] "awful episode with a heavy-handed, clod-hopping attempt at social comment that hardly sits well with the themes on display in the rest of the episode." [...] He called it the worst episode of the fourth season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five and wrote that it was [...] "trying very hard to be clever". Despite this the two explained that [...] "if cleverness were only about intent, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all be geniuses". Shearman and Pearson derided the episode's use of social criticism, referring to it as [...] "rubbish [...] only works if it isn't underlined each time it's made." [...] Furthermore, the two criticized the story's [...] "Mexican soap opera" [...] style, noting that it drowned out the themes in [...] "unengaging melodrama". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She wrote that [...] "'El Mundo Gira' is so overloaded with ideas that it falls over and can't get up".|$|E

2500|$|The uncomputability of S(n) {{can also}} be {{established}} by reference to the blank tape halting problem. The blank tape halting problem {{is the problem of}} deciding for any Turing machine whether or not it will halt when started on an empty tape. [...] The blank tape halting problem is equivalent to the standard halting problem and so it is also uncomputable. [...] If S(n) was computable, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> solve the blank tape halting problem simply by running any given Turing machine with n states for S(n) steps; [...] if it has still not halted, it never will. [...] So, since the blank tape halting problem is not computable, it follows that S(n) must likewise be uncomputable.|$|E
