5|$|Simplemente Lo Mejor {{was made}} {{available}} {{one month after}} the release of Arjona's eleventh studio album, 5to Piso (2008). This led to speculation that <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> were in a fight to win Arjona's fanbase and sales. Simplemente Lo Mejor reached number seven on the Mexican Albums Chart, the US Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart and number 33 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. It was awarded platinum certifications in Argentina and Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The kulintang {{repertoire}} has no fixed labels {{because the}} music {{itself is not}} considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always {{in a state of}} flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the emphasis is on the excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.|$|E
5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, {{released in the}} UK and US on 7 September 1987, on <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> EMI and Columbia. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.|$|E

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
5|$|The Irascibles or Irascible 18 were <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> {{given to}} a group of American {{abstract}} artists who put name to an open letter, written in 1950, to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, rejecting the museum's exhibition American Painting Today - 1950 and boycotting the accompanying competition. The subsequent media coverage of the protest and a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in Life magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term Abstract Expressionist and established them as the so-called first generation of the putative movement.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army, that {{controlled}} {{much of the}} southern part of the country during the Irish civil war, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, mainly because of a stamp shortage.

5|$|The {{focus of}} this debate often centers on a {{phenomenon}} named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, Malvern's reputation for purity suffered a blow when the rock that filters the water dried out during 2006, allowing the water from heavy storms to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process to take place efficiently. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under European Union law. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> were change from: Malvern The Original English Natural Mineral Water. Naturally filtered through Pre-Cambrian granite and sourced from deep beneath the Malvern Hills. to read The Original English Water Bottled in the Malvern Hills.|$|E

One of the most anticipated releases in 2011, Watch the Throne {{became one of the}} few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). <b>The</b> <b>labels</b> were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|E
