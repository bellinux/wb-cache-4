5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT {{conservatively}} {{identified a}} 0.7% reduction in <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities</b> during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS {{review of the}} DOT study found no differences in <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities.</b> In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities</b> by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities.</b> A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.|$|E

5|$|Along {{the coast}} of North Carolina, the {{hurricane}} produced light winds and rough waves, as well as moderate precipitation. Heavier rainfall occurred in southern New England, causing flooding in portions of New York City and producing slick roads that caused nine <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities.</b> Able produced hurricane-force winds in Nova Scotia, and damage across Canada totaled over $1million (1950CAD, $ USD) in the agriculture, communications, and fishing industries. Two people died in Canada when their raft was overturned.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} prompted {{standard precautions}} in the Bahamas and Florida, {{although it did}} not affect the region. In North Carolina, winds and waves brushed the coast, while around New York City, heavy rainfall caused some flooding. Along Cape Cod and Nantucket, Able produced winds up to 55mph (90km/h) and high waves, and across New England there were nine <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities.</b> The hurricane killed 2people in Canada and caused over $1million in damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} trough produced {{heavy rainfall}} across the western Caribbean Sea, which on Cuba unofficially reached over 7.8inches (200mm). Outer rainbands in Pinar del Río Province injured three people and damaged 55houses. In Florida, Barry dropped a moderate {{amount of precipitation}} across the drought-ridden state; rainfall peaked at 6.99inches (178mm). The rain caused some flooding and wet roads, which led to two indirect <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities.</b> Rough seas killed one Florida surfer in Pinellas County. In Florida and Georgia, the precipitation assisted firefighters in combating severe wildfires. Overall damage from the storm was minor.|$|E
5|$|Most {{developing}} countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty, to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs. Their interest {{is a result of}} improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging populations, the rising number of <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities,</b> and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so {{that they will be able}} to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine.|$|E

5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities,</b> but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Able was {{expected}} {{to move through the}} Bahamas, people executed standard preparations such as securing windows and bringing ships to harbor. One cruise liner diverted its route from the Bahamas toward New York. In Florida, the U.S. Air Force made preliminary plans to move planes. Ultimately, the hurricane spared the region. Further north, the United States Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Morehead City, North Carolina to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. There, the hurricane ended up bringing light winds and rough waves. Moderate precipitation occurred along the North Carolina coast. In southern New England, Able dropped 35inches (75125mm) of rainfall, with a peak of 6.89inches (175mm) in Beechwood, Massachusetts. Flooding was reported in portions of New York City. The resulting slick roads from the rains caused nine <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities</b> across New England. The storm produced 55mph (90km/h) gusts in Nantucket and Cape Cod, along with high tides and waves. Offshore, the waves damaged a freighter headed for Florida.|$|E

40|$|A statisticcl {{model for}} {{analysis}} of multiple time-series observation is briefly outlined. The model incorporates a change parameter corresponding to intervention or interruption of the dependent series. The additional time-series {{are included in the}} model as covariates. The practical application of the procedure is illustrated with <b>traffic</b> <b>fatality</b> data from several Northeast states. The intervention variable is a legislative crackdown on speeding offenders in Connecticut, whi,:h was claimed to have produced a significant drop in the <b>traffic</b> <b>fatality</b> rate. The analysis using neighboring states as covariates results in a change to nonsignificance for the intervention effect. The seasonal nature of the data also illustrates the applicability of the procedure when seasonality is present, so that no season adjustments are required. (Author) U S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH...|$|R
25|$|As Richardson {{discussed}} frequently {{during his}} 2008 run for President, he supported a controversial New Mexico law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses {{for reasons of}} public safety.

25|$|More recently, in {{response}} to growing numbers of traffic accidents and speeding problems, cities across North America have begun creating traffic calming programs to improve safety and liveability on residential streets. Many municipalities create asphalt or concrete measures, although preformed rubber products that are easier to install and consistently meet standardized requirements are becoming increasingly popular. However, after two years, San Francisco's Vision Zero program, which heavily features traffic calming, failed to abate <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to 2008, {{access to}} the iconic sign for photo {{opportunities}} was risky. There was no legal place for visitors to park, and visitors had to cross travel lanes of Las Vegas Boulevard and hop up onto a median to reach the sign.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} adds to {{the current}} understanding of the socioeconomic determinants of <b>traffic</b> <b>fatality</b> rates by examining the variation in road deaths across countries and over time. Chapter two investigates the relationship between road safety and economic development within an Environmental Kuznets Curve framework. Reduced-form models of fatality risk {{as a function of}} per capita income are estimated using panel data for over 80 countries. The results confirm an inverted U-shaped relationship with income, with <b>traffic</b> <b>fatality</b> risk (fatalities per population) beginning to decline at incomes similar to those found for several environmental externalities. The turning point is driven by the rate of decline in fatalities per vehicle as income rises, since motorization rates (vehicles per population), while increasing with income at a decreasing rate, never decline with economic growth. This suggests that road safety improvements accompanying income growth depend on policies that reduce fatalities per vehicle rather than on reducing motorization. Projections suggest that the global road death toll will grow by 66 % between 2000 and 2020 if historic trends continue. This number, however, reflects divergen...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the ways}} to {{estimate}} the value of statistical life or value of risk reduction from stated choice experiments is through the concept of marginal rates of substitution, i.e. how much would the respondents be willing to spend to prevent one <b>traffic</b> <b>fatality</b> (i.e. the rate at which they are willing to substitute money to save one life).|$|R

25|$|UMTRI {{houses the}} Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics. For many years, {{it has worked}} collaboratively with FMCSA and NHTSA to {{maintain}} the Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents (TIFA) and Buses Involved in Fatal Accidents (BIFA) databases. Starting with cases identified in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) (the U.S. national database of road <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities</b> based on police crash reports), UMTRI researchers collect detailed data on vehicle configuration, cargo type, hours of driving, and other variables. In addition, TIFA and BIFA data collection protocols are easily adapted to address emerging issues. Other strengths of the UMTRI program include vehicle engineering, crash avoidance systems such as collision warning systems and stability control, biomechanics, and risk factors such as distraction, fatigue, and medical conditions.|$|E

500|$|Motor vehicle crashes were a {{major factor}} {{that led to the}} {{development}} of emergency medicine in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and they are {{a major factor}} leading countries to develop their own emergency medical systems today. Such crashes represent a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults, with the majority of deaths occurring in the developing world. In recent decades, while <b>traffic</b> <b>fatalities</b> have declined in industrialized nations, they have been on the rise in developing ones. Furthermore, developing nations tend to have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of vehicles for various reasons, including lower safety standards for vehicles. The lack of available emergency care in many developing countries only serves to exacerbate this problem. This higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite the fact that there are fewer cars in Asia and Africa than in the West. Odero et al. argue that this shows a need to improve emergency medical care.|$|E

40|$|A {{state by}} year panel is {{analyzed}} to simultaneously explore the statistical correlation between state level <b>traffic</b> <b>fatality</b> rates and state level behavioral regulations regarding teen licensing, seat belt use, and {{driving under the}} influence (DUI) in a model that also controls for other correlates. Method: By including measures of all three of these policies, the estimated policy effects should not be overstated due to underspecification bias. The panel includes the 48 contiguous U. S. states for the time period from 1999 through 2003. State fatality rates are measured as fatalities per million miles traveled. Measures of state policies regarding traffic safety related behavior are based on information gathered by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Estimates are calculated via a time fixed effects model that uses the double-log form to allow for interaction effects between the independent variables. Results: Least squares estimates indicate that, on average, more restrictive graduated teen licensing and DUI policies significantly reduce <b>traffic</b> <b>fatality</b> rates, while stricter seat belt enforcement policies have a statistically insignificant negative impact on fatality rates...|$|R
