40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim of this project {{was to investigate the}} mechanics of the sprint start through the use of computer simulation. Experimental data was collected on one male athlete in accordance with a procedure agreed by Loughborough University Ethical Advisory Committee. The data provided subject specific data {{for the creation of a}} four and fourteen segment, angle and <b>torque</b> <b>driven</b> models of the sprint start. The models simulated the start from the moment of onset of force production until takeoff from the starting block. The four segment model comprised a head and trunk, thigh, shank and foot whilst the fourteen segment model also included a lower spine and pelvis, upper arms, forearms and hands, as well as the other leg including two segment feet. Subject specific torque data was combined with EMG data to provide input to the torque models Results from the four segment angle driven model demonstrated that the participant will benefit from using smaller joint angles than usual in the set position as this resulted in increased velocity on takeoff with minimal increase in movement time. The model also showed large joint torques during such starts and so suggested that this is likely to limit start performance. The four segment <b>torque</b> <b>driven</b> model also revealed that optimal joint angles exist for the hip and knee but such a result was not clear for the ankle. For this model the optimum angle at the hip was 73 (the smallest tested) and 108 at the knee which was the athlete’s usual angle. Increasing the athlete’s strength parameters resulted in a small increase in horizontal velocity on takeoff for some simulations and all simulations had enhanced acceleration. Increasing initial muscle activations didn’t increase horizontal takeoff velocity but did also increase horizontal acceleration. The fourteen segment angle driven model was used to optimise spring parameters for input into a <b>torque</b> <b>driven</b> model. The fourteen segment <b>torque</b> <b>driven</b> model simulated movements and forces realistically but an adequate match was not found to the sprint start performance of the participant due to long simulation times and lack of computing power...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} each {{mechanism}} of the Gilbert damping of wall motion corresponds to a current-induced <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> on the domain wall, {{based on the same}} electron processes. For example, the damping theory of Heinrich, Fraitova, and Kambersky {{is directly related to the}} theory of (nonadiabatic) <b>drive</b> <b>torques</b> by Zhang and Li. Using momentum conservation, this relation is extended to the wall resistance. This leads to a classification of most existing electron theories of damping and <b>drive</b> <b>torques,</b> and of wall resistance, into only three different kinds. In all cases, the <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> is derived from the damping torque by replacing the wall speed by an electron drift speed ≃R 0 j, where R 0 is the ordinary Hall constant and j the current density. This drift speed differs from the one which appears in existing theories of adiabatic spin-transfer torques on a wall. Using the present ideas, mechanisms for <b>drive</b> <b>torques</b> and wall resistance have been invented...|$|R

50|$|Thus, Vettel {{regained the}} first {{position}} {{as he began}} to slowly pull away from Button who was 1.7 seconds behind Vettel on lap 13 with Kubica a further two seconds adrift in third. Alonso had moved into tenth position by lap 13 and gained a further after he overtook de la Rosa at turn nine on the same lap. Alonso passed Barrichello for eighth on the 14th lap and set a new fastest lap on the following lap, a 1:31.573. Hamilton and Webber passed Alonso for fifth and sixth positions at the start of lap 16. Webber attempted to defend fifth place from Hamilton but went wide into the gravel trap at turn three and fell down to eighth. Massa immediately overtook Hamilton around the outside on the same lap. Hamilton started to battle Massa (who had graining on his right-rear tyre) for fifth position with Webber and Alonso starting to close the gap to the two drivers. Massa slid his car at turn 16 at the end of lap 21 which allowed Hamilton to pass Massa on the inside at Brabham corner although Hamilton sustained minor damage to his front wing. Hamilton defended Massa's attempt to pass him at Whiteford corner, while Alonso slowed which allowed Webber to pass him. Hamilton overtook Rosberg on the outside of turn eleven. Vettel had sparks coming from his left-front wheel and a large amount of vibrations built up in his car. This caused Vettel to lose <b>torque</b> <b>drive</b> between the front left axle and wheel, and spun into the gravel trap at Ascari corner on lap 26. Vettel's retirement promoted Button into the lead. Rosberg attempted to retake fourth from Hamilton at Ascari corner but was unable to {{because of the presence of}} yellow-flags. Webber passed Massa for fifth position at Whiteford corner two laps later. di Grassi drove to his garage to retire with an issue with his car's hydraulics on lap 29.Hamilton closed up on Kubica by the same lap; Hamilton attempted to overtake Kubica while in traffic but Kubica fended off Hamilton's attempt. Hamilton feigned passing manoeuvres at the Brabham and Whiteford corners with the latter attempt resulting in Hamilton losing time to Kubica and fell back in front of Rosberg. Webber made a pit stop for soft compound tyres on lap 33, while Hamilton tried another pass on Kubica on the back straight but Kubica closed the door on Hamilton. Rosberg made his pit stop for tyres one lap later and came out level with Webber as Rosberg exited the pit lane, but Webber's extra momentum allowed him to move ahead of Rosberg. Despite going fastest overall in the first and second sectors of the track after making a pit stop on lap 35, Hamilton went wide at Ascari corner on lap 37 which allowed Webber to briefly move ahead of Hamilton before the McLaren driver regained the position. Hamilton and Webber began to close on Alonso at the rate of two seconds a lap after setting a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:28.591 on lap 40 while Massa started to close the gap to Kubica. di Grassi rejoined the race on lap 39 but returned to the pit lane two laps later. Glock made a pit stop and his mechanics retired him from the race on the 45th lap because a camber shim on his car was loose and it caused the left rear suspension to move around. Hamilton caught Alonso on lap 49 but was unable to pass the Ferrari driver because Hamilton struggled with tyre degradation. Schumacher dived up the inside to attempt an overtake Alguersuari for eleventh place at Ascari corner on lap 56 and the two drivers wheels made contact before Schumacher got ahead at the Stewart corner.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirements}} for the manufacturing of high-precise complex micro parts cannot be satisfied alone by conventional 5 -axis machine systems since they are limited in their accuracy or stiffness. For this reason, the Fraunhofer IPT investigates and implements design strategies for the successful development of high-precise and stiff five-axis machine tools. Hereby the focus is set on descreasing the error activating cantilevers by reducing the overall machine dimensions (compact design) and additionally {{to reduce the number}} of joint patches, error activating cantilevers and moving masses by integrating several functions in particular items (integral design). This is exemplarily shown in the development of a five-axis grinding machine and the integration of a hydrostatic radial bearing into a <b>torque</b> <b>drive.</b> The two decribed design strategies follow precision design fundamentals and focus on the reduction of error activating cantilevers affecting Abbe, Pivot and Thermal Errors. Due to the compact design of the five-axis machine, a spatial positioning error of smaller than 3 micron and highest stiffness can be achieved. By the integration of a hydrostatic bearing into a <b>torque</b> <b>drive,</b> the Steiner Distance and Inertia is reduced substential.
