5|$|Butterfly {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins <b>that</b> <b>give</b> them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones <b>that</b> <b>give</b> them yellows, {{but many of the}} blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E

Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E

5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron <b>that</b> <b>give</b> a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance <b>that</b> <b>give</b> this species its English name. The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E

The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions' are tiny pincers {{that are used in}} feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{driver of}} this {{difference}} is due to cultural standards <b>that</b> <b>give</b> women little leverage {{in the selection of}} their partner.
