5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
25|$|Along with Chris and Shaz, it is {{revealed}} that Ray Carling had previously {{died in the}} real world. As a young DC, he commits suicide by hanging himself on 6 May 1972, the day of that year's FA Cup Final. He had been struggling with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had failed his father and grandfathers, who were all army sergeants, after he failed basic training for entry to the British Army. Ray took out his frustrations on a drunk young man outside a pub and ended up killing him, something which his DCI covered up. Ridden with guilt, he committed suicide by hanging himself in a bout of severe depression and alcohol abuse.|$|E

Another inspiration for the song was actor Sylvester Stallone's 1976 film Rocky, which is Gaga's favorite film. The singer felt that the song was about looking at life directly, with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she is a champion—like the emotion displayed by the character Rocky Balboa in the film.|$|E

The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption [...] "I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a good look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic.|$|E
500|$|As the Nazis {{began the}} {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, their Jewish policy changed from emigration to extermination. To co-ordinate planning for the genocide, Heydrich hosted the regime's administrative leaders at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Eichmann collected information for Heydrich, attended the conference, and prepared the minutes. Eichmann and his staff became responsible for Jewish deportations to extermination camps, where the victims were gassed. After Germany invaded Hungary in March 1944, Eichmann oversaw the deportation of much of that country's Jewish population. Most of the victims were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, where 75 to 90 per cent were murdered upon arrival. By the time the transports were stopped in July 1944, 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had been killed. Historian Richard J. Evans estimates that between 5.5 and 6million Jews were killed by the Nazis. Eichmann said {{towards the end of the}} war that he would [...] "leap laughing into the grave because <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had five million people on his conscience would be for him a source of extraordinary satisfaction." ...|$|E
500|$|Hajime Isayama {{created a}} 65-page {{one-shot}} version of Attack on Titan in 2006. Originally, he also offered {{his work to}} the Weekly Shōnen Jump department at Shueisha, where he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for Jump. He declined and instead decided {{to take it to}} the Weekly Shōnen Magazine department at Kodansha. Before serialization began in 2009, he had already thought of ideas for twists, although they are fleshed out as the series progresses. The author initially based the scenery in the manga on that of his hometown, which is surrounded by mountains. While working at an internet cafe, Isayama encountered a customer who grabbed him by the collar. It was this incident that showed him [...] "the fear of meeting a person I can't communicate with," [...] which is <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> conveys through the Titans. When designing the appearances of the Titans, he uses several models such as martial artist Yushin Okami for Eren Yeager's Titan form as well as Brock Lesnar for the Armored Titan. George Wada, the anime's producer, stated that the [...] "Wall of Fear" [...] was influenced by the isolated and enclosed nature of Japanese culture. He also said that the inner feelings of every individual is one of the series' main influences. Isayama later would confirm that Attack on Titan was inspired in part by Muv-Luv Alternative, the second visual novel in the Muv-Luv visual novel series.|$|E

[...] But by then—with the efforts to build his career and with time and distance between him and Maddalena—his feelings had changed and, using Florimo to communicate to the family, he rejected the offer, expressing <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be unable to support her financially. Even Maddalena's own pleas in three letters which followed failed to change his mind.|$|E

[...] "Before {{the beginning of the}} Arab Spring, we were a voice for change," [...] he says, [...] "a platform for critics and political activists throughout the region. Now, Al-Jazeera has become a propaganda broadcaster." [...] "Al-Jazeera takes a clear position in every country from which it reports -- not based on journalistic priorities, but rather on the interests of the Foreign Ministry of Qatar," [...] he says. [...] "In order to maintain my integrity as a reporter, I had to quit."" ...|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was somehow}} {{experiencing}} a divine communication, Dick was never fully able to rationalize the events. For {{the rest of}} his life, he struggled to comprehend what was occurring, questioning his own sanity and perception of reality. He transcribed what thoughts he could into an eight-thousand-page, one-million-word journal dubbed the Exegesis. From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick spent many nights writing in this journal. A recurring theme in Exegesis is Dick's hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century AD, and that [...] "the Empire never ended". He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism and despotism, which, after forcing the Gnostics underground, had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had communicated with him, and anonymous others, to induce the impeachment of U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor of Rome incarnate.|$|E

2500|$|He {{also sought}} to break from the class-conscious {{conventions}} of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, {{so as to make}} his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: [...] "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles...he democratized the dance in movies." [...] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: [...] "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the Manor born — I put them on and look like a truck driver." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897 Munch {{returned}} to Kristiania, {{where he also}} received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, [...] "A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance." [...] In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a [...] "liberated" [...] upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in [...] "The Frieze of Life" [...] series, The Dance of Life (1899). Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as {{he wrote in the}} third person: [...] "Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no right to get married." [...] Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin. His Girls on the Jetty, created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations. In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing [...] "a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval." [...] The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work even though the public still found his work alien and strange.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason for}} Frazier's sudden removal {{from the top}} of the card was never explained, but Kevin Nash (Diesel) implied it had {{something}} to do with his wrestling style. Nash said in an interview with Kayfabe Commentaries that Frazier's style was very reckless and he had little regard for the safety of his fellow wrestlers. Nash said that entering the match at SummerSlam, Frazier had already injured [...] "six or eight" [...] of his colleagues in the ring. Nash said that one of the injuries was to one of the Samoans on the roster (Fatu), which he implied was not easy to do and should have raised a red flag. Nash pointed to Frazier's use of a frequently utilized move by wrestlers of comparable size, the sitdown splash. Most wrestlers who perform this move, such as the aforementioned Fatu (who adopted the move later in his career) and Earthquake, do so without incident as they perform it in such a manner that very little of their body weight actually comes in contact with the opponent's body. Frazier, as described by Nash, would kick his legs out while performing the move and thus did not allow himself to stop before impact, which caused all of Frazier's 500-plus pound body weight to shift to his rear end and land on the opponent. Further, Frazier did not perform the maneuver on an opponent's chest like usual, instead using the move on the lower back of his opponents. With this in mind Nash told Frazier to leave the move out of the match. Frazier disregarded the request and performed the sitdown splash on Nash's lower back anyway, which caused his spine to compress and his core muscles to stretch out and left Nash with a badly strained abdomen that affected his performance the rest of the match, along with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had suffered some sort of permanent damage to his spine. Backstage, Nash recounted that a furious Vince McMahon was ready to fire Frazier immediately after the match and was about to hand him his release papers, but Nash stepped in and convinced McMahon otherwise as he did not feel Frazier should lose his job over the incident. However, it is worth mentioning that no other wrestlers when asked about Frazier have agreed with this sentiment.|$|E
