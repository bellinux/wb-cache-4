5|$|The Jacob is a small, multi-horned, piebald sheep <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> goat in its conformation. However, {{it is not}} {{the only}} breed that can produce polycerate or piebald offspring. Other polycerate breeds include the Hebridean, Icelandic, Manx Loaghtan, and the Navajo-Churro, and other piebald breeds include the Finnsheep and the West African Dwarf.|$|E
5|$|Warning signals do not {{necessarily}} require that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking species <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E

Monica warms to David and activates his imprinting protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear who cares for David's well-being.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{along the}} face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is another small Hindu {{excavation}} with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock. Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist stupa. This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist stupa from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E

She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (a piercing near the upper lip <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (a piercing {{on each side of the}} lower lip).|$|E

5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} north and south wall, the {{entrance}} of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion {{depends on the}} style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E

5|$|Schubert's last sonatas mark a {{distinct}} change of compositional style from his earlier piano sonatas, with several important differences. The typical movement length has increased, {{due to the}} use of long, lyrical, fully rounded-off, ternary-form themes, the insertion of development-like passages within expositions, and the lengthening of the development section proper. Texturally, the orchestral grandeur of the middle-period sonatas gives way to a more intimate writing <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> string ensemble. New textures appear in the last sonatas – scale-like melodic elements, free counterpoint, free fantasia, and simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass, repeated chords, and ostinati; the orchestral unison texture, abundant in the preceding sonatas, has disappeared. The harmonic language has also changed: more distant key relationships are explored, longer modulatory excursions, more major/minor shifts of mode, and more chromatic and diverse harmonic progressions and modulations, using elements such as the diminished seventh chord. In general, the last sonatas seem to enact a return to an earlier, more individual and intimate Schubertian style, here combined with the compositional craftsmanship of Schubert's later works.|$|E
5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.|$|E
