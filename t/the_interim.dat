50|$|The last eventful and sorrowful {{period of}} his life began with controversies over <b>the</b> <b>Interims</b> and <b>the</b> Adiaphora (1547). It is true, Melanchthon {{rejected}} <b>the</b> Augsburg <b>Interim,</b> which <b>the</b> emperor tried to force upon the defeated Protestants; but in the negotiations concerning <b>the</b> so-called Leipzig <b>Interim</b> he made concessions which many feel can in no way be justified, even if one considers his difficult position, opposed as he was to the elector and the emperor.|$|R
5000|$|Protestant leaders {{rejected}} {{the terms of}} <b>the</b> Augsburg <b>Interim.</b> <b>The</b> Leipzig <b>Interim</b> was designed to allow Lutherans to retain their core theological beliefs, specifically where the doctrine of justification by grace was concerned, while yielding in other, less important matters, such as church rituals. This compromise document again drew opposition. Those who supported <b>the</b> Leipzig <b>Interim</b> became identified as Philippists, as they supported Melanchthon’s efforts at compromise. Those who opposed Melanchthon became known as [...] "Gnesio-Lutherans", or [...] "genuine" [...] Lutherans.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Interim</b> Committee {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945. Stimson began by {{outlining}} its broad terms of reference, which included advising the President on wartime controls {{and the release of}} information, and making recommendations on post-war controls and policies related to nuclear energy, including legislation. <b>The</b> <b>Interim</b> Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military use of nuclear weapons but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use of nuclear weapons and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to <b>the</b> <b>Interim</b> Committee's involvement.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland's last regular-season game, {{defensive}} coordinator Chris Cosh and tight ends coach and special teams assistant Danny Pearman announced their resignations.

For the bowl game, Maryland's defensive line coach, Al Seamonson, was named as <b>the</b> <b>interim</b> {{defensive coordinator}}.

5|$|In July 1944, before <b>the</b> <b>Interim</b> Committee was formed, Bush, Conant and Irvin Stewart had {{produced}} {{a proposal for}} legislation to control nuclear energy. Conant submitted the proposals to <b>the</b> <b>Interim</b> Committee at its meeting on July 9, 1945. Harrison brought in two experienced lawyers, Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury {{to take up the}} job of drafting the legislation. Their draft bill would have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, to operate facilities, to conduct research and to regulate all forms of nuclear energy. The Royall-Marbury bill was reviewed by <b>the</b> <b>Interim</b> Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. The bill was forwarded to the President in August. <b>The</b> <b>Interim</b> Committee met again on September 28 to discuss legislative strategy.
