5|$|Unlike most {{religions}} in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents {{to renounce}} all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant {{they were unable}} to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the author}} of the Gesta Henrici quinti, Henry V aimed ‘to promote the honour of God, the {{extension}} of the Church, the deliverance of his country and <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> tranquillity of kingdoms’. He was deeply religious, engaged with ecclesiastical issues and saw that his role as king was to honour God, extend the church, fight heresy and defend the established social order. All his victories, especially Agincourt, were attributed to divine intervention. Henry V founded Syon Abbey in 1415, as penance for his father’s execution of Archbishop Scrope, and three monasteries in London: for Carthusian, Bridgettine and Celestine orders. The equally devout Henry VI continued the architectural patronage begun by his father, founding Eton College and King's College, Cambridge and leaving a lasting educational and architectural legacy in buildings including King's College Chapel and Eton College Chapel.|$|E

His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
