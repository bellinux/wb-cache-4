Although {{the range of}} characterizations is broad, people affected by nephronophthisis typically present with polyuria (production of a large volume of urine), polydipsia (excessive liquid intake), and after several months to years, end-stage kidney disease, a condition necessitating either dialysis or a kidney transplant in order to survive. Some individuals that suffer from nephronophthisis also have so-called [...] "extra-renal symptoms" [...] which can include <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> liver problems, ocularmotor apraxia, and cone-shaped epiphysis (Saldino-Mainzer syndrome).|$|E
40|$|A 13 -year-old {{girl with}} severe mental retardation, <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> an {{extinguished}} electroretinogram and sensoneurinal hearing loss is described. In early life {{the diagnosis of}} Zellweger (cerebro-hepato-renal) syndrome was considered because of hypotonia, craniofacial dysmorphia, abnormal liver functions and pipecolic aciduria. Biochemical studies in fibroblasts from the patient revealed a general peroxisomal dysfunction comparable to the findings in Zellweger Syndrome. As the clinical presentation of this patient is essentially different from that in classical Zellweger patients, who usually die early in life, we recommend the study of peroxisomal functions in all patients with severe mental retardation, <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> and sensoneurinal hearing los...|$|E

40|$|Coat’s like {{disease was}} {{observed}} in literature in different incidence up 3, 6 % of patients. Our experience shows that even if microteleangectasies are frequently observed in <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> exudation and retinal detachment are less frequent, only to these two main symtoms are specifically present in the Coat’s like disease. Moreover these findings are not inherited in fact in our pedigree only two patients on ten had this charachteristic, so we think that, as observed in other cases of chorio-retinal scars, a vascular shunt between choriocapillary and retinal system may cause a surcharge of blood flow in the capillary network starting the exudative response. In this view we consider that Coat’s like disease and Retinitis Pigmentosa are two different entities casually associated...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe retinal {{disorders}} {{are responsible for}} the most difficult types of visual lost. They are presented as a disturbances of the photoreceptors, pigment epithelium, bruchs membrane and the choriocapilaris. Material and methodsAccording to the results from the Fluorescent Angiography (FFA) in the period of 1981 - 96 in 30 children are registered retinal heredodegenerative disorders. The patients are in the age from 7 - 15 years. Out of this number of patients, 11 have Degeneratio tapetoretinalis and 19 have Degeneratio ML juvenilis. The diagnosis is based on this investigations: visual activity, opthalmoscopy, FFA, perimetry and electrophysiological investigation. DiscussionBecause of the early lost of visual function in the childhood, the frequency of the registered patients with macular degenerations is bigger than the patients with <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degenerations.</b> ConclusionThe number of patients with heredodegenerative disturbances is bigger after 15 years of age, then in the group up to 15 years of age. Considering the meaning of this problem we should make an early screening of all children in the pre-school period...|$|R
40|$|Few {{data on the}} {{incidence}} of blindness in Germany are available. We analysed causes of legal blindness for the region Württemberg-Hohenzollern (population 5. 5 million) {{in order to help}} fill in this gap. Material and Methods: Population-based investigation on {{the incidence}} of legal blindness (visual acuity < 1 / 50) based on materials from the social servies. Age-dependent blindness incidences were modelled via logistic regression models. Results: 647 blind persons were newly registered in 1994 (blindness incidence 11. 6 / 100, 000). The blindness incidence is moderate in infants (4. 5 / 100, 000) and decreases further during childhood. At the age of 20 years, the incidence again rises to the former level and remains relatively constant. After the age of 60 years, the incidence increases sharply: 5 -year odds ratios are 1. 76 (CI: 1. 68 - 1. 85) in women and 1. 72 (CI: 1. 60 - 1. 84) in men. The blindness incidence is higher in women, 15. 6 / 100, 000, compared to 12. 2 / 100, 000 in men. The major causes of blindness are: macular degeneration, 3. 92 / 100, 000; diabetic retinopathy, 2. 01 / 100, 000; glaucoma, 1. 6 / 100, 000; high myopia, 0. 77 / 100, 000; optic atrophy, 0. 68 / 100, 000; central nervous system-triggered blindness; 0. 56 / 100, 000, and <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degenerations,</b> 0. 52 / 100, 000. Discussion: Due to monetary incentives for the blind persons, social service files offer accurate and complete data. Besides macular degeneration, glaucoma and dia betic retinopathy are major causes of blindness. Thus, this study suggests further blindness prevention activities for diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. ...|$|R

40|$|Nephronophthisis is {{a chronic}} tubulointerstitial nephritis with {{autosomal}} recessive inheritance that progress to end-stage renal failure usually during adolescence. The first signs appear after 3 {{years of age}} with a urine concentration defect responsible for polyuria and polydipsia, failure to thrive and a progressive deterioration of renal function without signs of glomerular disease. Renal ultrasonography reveals normal-sized kidneys and, at advanced stages, medullary cysts. Histologic lesions concern tubular basement membranes which are thickened and multilayered or thinned. There is an associated interstitial fibrosis. Some children present with extrarenal symptoms. Nephronophthisis {{can be associated with}} <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> as in Senior-Loken syndrome (congenital nystagmus and early blindness). Other associations are possible: mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia, bone anomalies or liver involvement. A gene involved in the disease has been mapped to chromosome 2 q 13. Homozygous deletions in that region have been detected in 70 % of affected children. This gene, NPHP 1, encodes an internal protein, nephrocystin. Mutations in this gene are associated with 50 to 85 % of cases. Genetic heterogeneity was demonstrated and a new gene, NPHP 4 has been mapped on chromosome 1 p 36. This gene codes for nephrocystin- 4. Mutations in the NPHP 3 gene cause an adolescent form of Nephronophthisis, which may be associated with <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> or hepatic fibrosis. Mutations of the NPHP 2 gene, which encodes for inversin are responsible for an infantile form of Nephronophthisis which progress to end stage renal failure before age 5...|$|E

40|$|Usher {{syndrome}} is an autosomal recessively inherited disease, characterised by sensorineural hearing loss, <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> {{and in some}} cases vestibular problems.

Usher syndrome type III, caused by mutations in the USH 3 gene, is frequently seen only in Finland...|$|E
40|$|Three {{children}} who presented in infancy {{with a severe}} visual defect and absent or barely recordable electroretinograms, with relatively well preserved visually evoked cortical potentials, were subsequently found to have vertical and horizontal saccade palsies with head thrusts but relatively good visual acuity. These children, who were clearly different from other infants with congenital retinal dystrophy, were also developmentally delayed and had systemic motor and speech defects, but their visual prognosis was relatively good. The recognition of their saccade palsy was delayed because their poor visual attention in infancy was ascribed purely to the <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration.</b> We consider these patients represent a clear subset of those patients who are diagnosed as having congenital retinal dystrophy or Leber's amaurosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper by Robins et al. (Archives, 1976, 51, 799) reporting a child with nephronophthisis and liver fibrosis. This observation reinforces the feeling that such association is not fortuitous, as we stated when publishing a similar case (Proesmans et al., 1975) shortly after the original description by Boichis et al. (1973). Our patient also had <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> a condi-tion frequently found in children with nephronophthisis and generally {{referred to as the}} Senior syndrome.

40|$|SUMMARY The fundus {{abnormalities}} of Leber's congenital amaurosis are extremely variable, from normal to salt-and-pepper changes to typical retinitis pigmentosa. A less commonly seen appearance {{is that of}} multiple, irregular shaped, yellowish white flecks deep in the midperipheral retina in a periarteriolar distribution. The nasal fundus {{as well as the}} posterior pole are spared. Such a case is presented along with a four-year follow-up together with the fluorescein angiographic findings. The flecks appear to be specific for this entity. In 1896 Leber originally described a syndrome of congenital blindness with nystagmus, poor pupillary response, and funduscopic findings of <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration.</b> ' In 1954 Franceschetti and Dieterle 2 emphasised the importance of a markedly abnormal or extinct electroretinogram (ERG) in the diagnosis of the syndrome complex now known as Leber's congenital amaurosis.

40|$|A mild {{variant of}} Zellweger (cerebro-hepato-renal) {{syndrome}} was diagnosed in {{male and female}} siblings aged 7 and 2 years. They had mild facial dysmorphia, moderate psychomotor retardation, <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> sensorineural deafness and hepatomegaly. Ultrastructural examination of a liver biopsy in the younger patient revealed the absence of recognizable peroxisomes. In both patients plasma levels of pipecolic acid, phytanic acid, trihydroxycoprostanoic acid and dihydroxycoprostanoic acid were elevated. The very long chain fatty acid C 26 : 0 and the C 26 : 0 /C 22 : 0 fatty acid ratio were elevated in plasma, but less than in classical Zellweger syndrome. In cultured fibroblasts, deficient acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase and increased concentrations of C 26 : 0 as well as C 26 : 1 very long chain fatty acids were found within the ranges previously established for patients with classical Zellweger syndrome. Particle-bound catalase was absent in fibroblasts.

40|$|The {{proximal}} albino deletions identify several functional regions on mouse Chromosome 7 {{critical for}} differentiation of mesoderm (mesd), {{development of the}} hypothalamus neuroendocrine lineage (nelg), and function of the liver (hsdr 1). Using comparative mapping and genomic sequence analysis, we have identified four novel genes and Il 16 in the mesd deletion interval. Two of the novel genes, mesdc 1 and mesdc 2, are located within the mesd critical region defined by BAC transgenic rescue. We have investigated the fetal role of genes located outside the mesd critical region using BAC transgenic complementation of the mesd early embryonic lethality. Using human radiation hybrid mapping and BAC contig construction, we have identified a conserved region of human chromosome 15 homologous to the mesd, nelg, and hsdr 1 functional regions. Three human diseases cosegregate with microsatellite markers used in construction of the human BAC/YAC physical map, including autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ENFL 2; also known as ADNFLE), a syndrome of mental retardation, spasticity, and <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> (MRST); and a pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome (PAPA). © 2001 Academic Press...|$|E
40|$|An {{autosomal}} dominant cone dystrophy-cerebellar atrophy (ADCoCA) pedigree (with symptoms of variable penetration) over five generations is described. Visual deterioration may start {{in early childhood}} and precede the cerebellar ataxia by many years, while the ophthalmo-logical {{as well as the}} neurological signs and symptoms may practically remain silent throughout life. Next to those carriers, fully unaffected members may transmit the disease. This ADCoCA is characterized initially by a tritan-colour defect and bull's eye macula, characteristic for cone dystrophy, progressing to photoreceptor dystrophy over the entire retina, with progressive extinction of the photopic and scotopic ERG (cone-rod dystrophy). Histopathology shows progressive loss of photoreceptors, degeneration of afferent and efferent cerebellar pathways, hemispheric cerebellar cortical atrophy, loss of retinal ganglion cells, trans-geniculate atrophy of the optic pathway, typical involvement and atrophy of the corpus subthalami-cum and pallidum, progressive involvement of lower motor nuclei of the brainstem, loss of neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and slight atrophy of the pyramidal pathways. This is one of the rare families where a dominant cone dystrophy combined with ataxia, has been documented throughout an entire family, as many cases are observed later in life and described as <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> and (or) optic atrophy, whereas both latter are only secondary, but may appear primary, as the natural course of the disease is lacking. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|Many genetic {{diseases}} {{have been}} linked to the dysfunction of primary cilia, which occur nearly ubiquitously in the body and act as solitary cellular mechanosensory organelles. The list of clinical manifestations and affected tissues in cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) such as nephronophthisis is broad and has been attributed to the wide expression pattern of ciliary proteins. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms leading to this dramatic diversity of phenotypes. We recently reported hypomorphic NPHP 3 mutations in children and young adults with isolated nephronophthisis and associated hepatic fibrosis or <b>tapetoretinal</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Here, we chose a combinatorial approach in mice and humans to define the phenotypic spectrum of NPHP 3 /Nphp 3 mutations and the role of the nephrocystin- 3 protein. We demonstrate that the pcy mutation generates a hypomorphic Nphp 3 allele that is responsible for the cystic kidney disease phenotype, whereas complete loss of Nphp 3 function results in situs inversus, congenital heart defects, and embryonic lethality in mice. In humans, we show that NPHP 3 mutations can cause a broad clinical spectrum of early embryonic patterning defects comprising situs inversus, polydactyly, central nervous system malformations, structural heart defects, preauricular fistulas, and a wide range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). On the functional level, we show that nephrocystin- 3 directly interacts with inversin and can inhibit like inversin canonical Wnt signaling, whereas nephrocystin- 3 deficiency leads in Xenopus laevis to typical planar cell polarity defects, suggesting a role in the control of canonical and noncanonical (planar cell polarity) Wnt signaling...|$|E
