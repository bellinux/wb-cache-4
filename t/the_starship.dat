5|$|The {{division}} of labor for shooting <b>the</b> <b>starship</b> models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount of}} work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
