5|$|Both {{free and}} paid DLC was {{announced}} as being planned {{as early as}} April 2016, with paid DLC being described as a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while <b>the</b> <b>main</b> game was completed. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> aim was to make players feel they had made a good purchase. Full production began after <b>the</b> <b>main</b> game was completed. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing <b>the</b> <b>main</b> game, while Sawatari created the DLC {{with a group of}} core developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine <b>the</b> <b>main</b> appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that the breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group. Square Enix stressed when the details were announced that the DLC was not content cut from the game itself, but original content to add new experiences for players.|$|E
