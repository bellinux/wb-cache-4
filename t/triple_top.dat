50|$|Most of {{the rules}} that are applied in the {{formation}} of the <b>triple</b> <b>top</b> can be reversed {{in the formation of}} triple bottom. As far as volume is concerned, the third low bottom should be on low volume and the rally up from that bottom should show a marked increase in activity.|$|E

After the double top has been confirmed and if prices are moving up again with low volume, it is an opportune point to sell. One can sell short with a stop (calculated loss) above the highest peak of the Double top. The next opportune point to sell would be after a <b>Triple</b> <b>top</b> has formed and a fourth top is being formed at the lower level.|$|E

50|$|The {{formation}} of triple tops is rarer {{than that of}} double tops in the rising market trend. The volume is usually low during the second rally up and lesser during the {{formation of}} the third top. The peaks may not necessarily be spaced evenly like those which constitute a Double top. The intervening valleys may not bottom out at exactly the same level, i.e. either the first or second may be lower. The <b>triple</b> <b>top</b> is confirmed when the price decline from the third top falls below the bottom of the lowest valley between the three peaks.|$|E

40|$|Cao, HuantianGrowing {{concerns}} over the environmental and social impacts related {{to the production of}} clothing and textiles have created a need for more discussion about supply chain practices. Currently, there are no guidelines or strategies for addressing sustainable supply chains in the apparel industry that minimize environmental impacts and uphold socially responsible practices. This exploratory case study traces an apparel supply chain, with a focus on cotton, in South Africa that is under a development strategy to create a sustainable supply chain from farm to retail. In-depth interviews were conducted across the supply chain, including cotton farmers, cotton gins, a cotton yarn manufacturer, a textile mill, an apparel manufacturer, and a retailer. The {{purpose of the study was}} to gain an understanding of the business decisions at each node of the supply chain that influence the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability by applying the <b>triple</b> <b>top</b> line model (McDonough & Braungart, 2002). This study identifies strengths and weaknesses in sustainable practices that adhere to the <b>triple</b> <b>top</b> line model within each node of the supply chain. Results found economic factors were drivers for good social and environmental practices, with the latter being the smallest segment of the three. The study makes recommendations for improving practices at each node of the supply chain and recommendations for strategies for developing sustainable apparel supply chains.

40|$|Current {{business}} models employ {{the concept of}} the triple bottom line to integrate three aspects of sustainability into the organizational process: economic growth, environmental protection and social equity. This concept is evolving toward a regenerative design approach that promotes a triple 2 ̆ 2 top 2 ̆ 2 line, moving accountability {{to the beginning of the}} design process by assigning value to a variety of economic, environmental and social factors. There is an increasingly important need for proactive participation from the construction community in this new generation of sustainability efforts. Otherwise, there will be a widening gap between design and construction, in which the contractor role in sustainability is marginalized, relegated to merely minimizing end-of-project impacts rather than adding value and innovation throughout the project. This paper examines the <b>triple</b> <b>top</b> line in the context of construction projects and identifies opportunities for construction professionals to play a collaborative role in developing the next generation of regenerative facilities...|$|E
40|$|The administrations {{of several}} {{universities}} have developed strategies {{to reduce the}} negative environmental effects created by their institutions. Because no single, comprehensive methodology to guide institutions to sustainability exists, these strategies range widely in scope. As well, the definition of 2 ̆ 2 sustainability 2 ̆ 2 differs for these various institutions, resulting in strategies ranging from small-scale recycling programs to major initiatives to incorporate green building and revamping curricula. This study attempts to create the first comprehensive methodology to guide university campuses and processes to become regenerative. Regenerative systems 2 ̆ 2 produce more resources than needed, provide resources for other projects, and enhance [the] environment 2 ̆ 2 (Bernheim 2003), and are synonymous with the 2 ̆ 2 <b>triple</b> <b>top</b> line 2 ̆ 2 of sustainability presented by Braungart and McDonough (2002). Sustainability plans of other universities were reviewed to determine what strategies have been successful for these institutions. These data were synthesized to create the comprehensive methodology. The methodology is incremental to allow time for institutions to adjust their financial plans and facilities management practices. Subsequently, the University of South Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Tampa campus (USF) served as a case study. Buildings and other infrastructure were reviewed, as were the curricula, buying practices, food service, and other university processes. Finally, a survey {{was presented to the}} primary decision-makers for USF to identify obstacles to implementation of the sustainability methodology.

40|$|Eco-effectiveness and {{cradle-to-cradle}} design {{present an}} alternative design and production concept to {{the strategies of}} zero emission and eco-efficiency. Where eco-efficiency and zero emission seek to reduce the unintended negative consequences of processes of production and con-sumption, eco-effectiveness is a positive agenda for the conception and production {{of goods and services}} that incorporate social, economic, and environmental benefit, enabling <b>triple</b> <b>top</b> line growth. Eco-effectiveness moves beyond zero emission approaches by focusing on the development of products and industrial systems that maintain or enhance the quality and productivity of materials through subsequent life cycles. The concept of eco-effectiveness also addresses the major shortcomings of eco-efficiency approaches: their inability to address the necessity for fundamental redesign of material flows, their inherent antagonism towards long-term economic growth and innovation, and their insufficiency in addressing toxicity issues. A central component of the eco-effectiveness concept, cradle-to-cradle design provides a practical design framework for creating products and industrial systems in a positive relationship with ecological health and abundance, and long-term economic growth. Against this background, the transition to eco-effective industrial systems is a five-step process beginning with an elimination of undesirable substances and ultimately calling for a reinvention of products by reconsidering how they may optimally fulfill the need or needs for which they are actually intended while simultaneously being supportive of ecological and social systems. This process necessitates the creation of an eco-effective system of ‘‘nutrient’ ’ management to coordinate the material flows amongst actors in the product system. The concept of intelligent materials pooling illustrates how such a system might take shape, in reality. 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
