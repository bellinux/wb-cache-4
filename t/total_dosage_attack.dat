Patients were treated with one of two intravesical adjuvant administration protocols : A or B. All patients were received one instillation of 30 nig of epirubicin (EPI) just after TUR. Group A : Early instillation group : Four instillations were done every 24 hr after the first instillation.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} different pivmecillinam (PIV) regimes for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs). Methods: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involving adults or children with symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated UTI and that compared different PIV regimes or PIV versus other antibiotics were included. Meta-analyses were conducted to obtain direct and indirect efficacy estimates. PIV regimes were categorized into high <b>total</b> <b>dosage,</b> moderate <b>total</b> <b>dosage,</b> and low <b>total</b> <b>dosage.</b> The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane tool. Results: Twenty-four RCTs were identified. No difference in clinical cure was found for the high vs. moderate (short-term: risk ratio (RR) 1. 01, p =  0. 813; long term: RR 1. 09, p =  0. 174) or high vs. low dosage comparisons (mean difference 0, 95 % confidence interval − 0. 44 to 0. 45, p =  1). For bacteriological cure, comparisons of high vs. moderate dosage (short term: RR 1. 05, p =  0. 056; long term: RR 1. 05, p =  0. 131) and high vs. low dosage (short term: RR 1. 02, p =  0. 759; long term: RR 1. 13, p =  0. 247) showed a trend {{in favor of the}} high dosage treatment.

Patients treated with high dosages were 40 % (p =  0. 062) and 44 % (p =  0. 293) more likely to report mild to moderate adverse events. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of an optimal combination of dosage, frequency, and duration of PIV therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated lower UTI.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTopiramate is an {{effective}} anti-epileptic drug and {{can be associated with}} increased risk for urolithiasis because of its effects on acid–base profile. Evidences that supported an association of topiramate and urolithiasis were limited to case reports or series. We investigated the association of topiramate and urolithiasis in a nationwide population-based cohort study. MethodsWe analyzed 1377 patients receiving topiramate and 1377 age- and gender-matched control patients (not receiving topiramate) between 1997 and 2008. The risk of urolithiasis was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier analysis, followed by Cox proportional hazard regression. ResultsOf the 2754 patients, 79 (2. 9 %) patients developed urolithiasis in two (interquartile range: 1. 2 – 4. 2) years. The proportion of patients who developed urolithiasis in the patients receiving topiramate was not {{different from that of the}} control patients (p= 0. 138, χ 2 test). The urolithiasis free survival was not different between the patients receiving topiramate and the control patients (p= 0. 168) in Cox proportional hazard regression.

Carboplatin (300 mg/m 2) was administered in combination with 5 -fluorouracil, and iproplatin was administered in dosages ranging from 216 to 388 mg/m 2. Enzymuria and proteinuria induced by cisplatin at a <b>total</b> <b>dosage</b> of 200 mg/m 2 on a divided schedule did not significantly differ from that observed for the single 100 mg/m 2 dose. Enzymuria and proteinuria induced by carboplatin and iproplatin were significantly less than that for cisplatin; however, one patient developed chronic tubular damage after three courses of carboplatin, and the acute tubular toxicity of iproplatin in one of 15 patients was exceptional. Our findings support the value of administering cisplatin in hypertonic saline on a divided schedule as a strategy to reduce acute tubular damage. Although carboplatin and iproplatin are less nephrotoxic than cisplatin, occasionally patients experience subclinical acute or chronic tubular damage {{that may lead to}} overt nephrotoxicity with continued therapy...|$|R

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} analysed {{the data}} obtained {{in a large}} randomised trial performed in 505 eligible patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Its purpose had been to compare a combination of carboplatin (200 mg/m 2) and cisplatin (60 mg/m 2) {{with or without the}} addition of ifosfamide. The present retrospective analysis assessed two ways of dosing carboplatin: according to body surface area (mg/m 2) or to the estimated targeted area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC). Two different methods were used in the latter calculation: the Calvert formula using the Cockroft approximation to evaluate the glomerular filtration rate and the Chatelut equation. There was an excellent linear correlation between them. With the Chatelut method, the calculated administered AUC were lower. Whichever method was used, carboplatin AUC was not significantly associated with antitumour response rate nor patient survival. A statistically significant increase in haematological toxicity, mainly thrombopenia, was observed with an increase in the AUC. This effect was observed whatever AUC variable was considered, i. e. <b>total</b> <b>dosage</b> at course one, <b>total</b> <b>dosage</b> during the first three chemotherapy courses or dose intensity during the first three courses. The effect remained highly significant after adjustment for treatment arm. We conclude that for a moderate carboplatin dose in non-small cell lung cancer, the therapeutic index could be improved if dosage is calculated according to the AUC.
