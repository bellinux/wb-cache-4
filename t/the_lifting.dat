5|$|The dock {{was used}} for fitting out vessels, and the crane would lift engines and boilers into ships. <b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> {{capacity}} of the Titan, {{and the location of}} the yard at the confluence of the River Clyde and River Cart, contributed {{to the success of the}} yard as it could build extremely large ships.|$|E
5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate was {{considering}} {{whether or not}} to prosecute WCRC. The ORR also has powers to prosecute; they subsequently decided to prosecute both WCRS and the driver of the train.

5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual labor of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May, it was {{reported}} that The Jacobite season was likely to start late due to the suspension. The trains, which run on the West Highland Line in Scotland, were due to start running on 11 May {{for the start of the}} 2015 season. Following <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of the ban on 8 May, it was announced that The Jacobite trains would run as scheduled from 11 May.|$|E
5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. <b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E

5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of {{the five-year}} ban on English clubs from European competitions, {{which had been}} imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster, United became England's first {{entrants}} into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the 1990–91 season. Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to the final against FC Barcelona. He came close to scoring the first goal, only for Mark Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United {{went on to win}} the game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13times in the First Division and 19times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the Football League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E

50|$|Wingtip {{vortices}} {{modify the}} airflow around a wing, reducing wing's {{ability to generate}} lift, so that it requires a higher angle of attack for <b>the</b> same <b>lift,</b> which tilts <b>the</b> total aerodynamic force rearwards and increases the drag component of that force. The angular deflection is small and has little effect on <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b> However, there {{is an increase in}} the drag equal to the product of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> force and <b>the</b> angle through which it is deflected. Since the deflection is itself a function of <b>the</b> <b>lift,</b> <b>the</b> additional drag is proportional to the square of <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R

5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting {{his office}} in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army.

5|$|Offshore, several oil {{and natural}} gas rigs were {{evacuated}} due to the proximity of Earl. An estimated 10,000 workers were evacuated from both onshore and offshore rigs. The storm forced many Florida residences to evacuate, especially people living in the barrier islands along the Florida Gulf Coast. About 30 Air Force jets from Eglin Air Force Base were sent to Oklahoma to protect them from the storm. A mandatory evacuation was issued for 20,000 residents in Leon County as well as all barrier islands along the Florida coast due to the risk of substantial flooding. Franklin County was briefly under a mandatory evacuation order on September2, the reasons for <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of the order are unknown.

5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance {{of women on}} the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of the ban after {{the founding of the}} Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape.
