5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E
5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) {{on top of the}} bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and <b>the</b> <b>die</b> knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> lies facing upward when <b>the</b> <b>die</b> comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of rotary swaging machine, the {{standard}} (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt swaging machine. A butt swaging machine works by having sets of wedges that close <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> onto <b>the</b> workpiece by inserting them between the annular rollers and <b>the</b> <b>dies,</b> normally by <b>the</b> use of a foot pedal. A butt swaging machine can allow a workpiece to be inserted without <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> closing on it, for example a three-foot workpiece can be inserted 12inches and then <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> closed, drawn through until 12inches remain and <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be four feet long but still of its initial diameter for a foot at each end.|$|R
5|$|Holes {{and windows}} require special {{consideration}} when die casting because the perimeters {{of these features}} will grip to <b>the</b> <b>die</b> steel during solidification. To counteract this affect, generous draft should be added to hole and window features.|$|E

5|$|The main {{failure mode}} for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other failure modes are heat {{checking}} and thermal fatigue. Heat checking is when surface cracks occur on <b>the</b> <b>die</b> {{due to a}} large temperature change on every cycle. Thermal fatigue is when surface cracks occur on <b>the</b> <b>die</b> due to {{a large number of}} cycles.|$|E
40|$|Determining {{the onset}} of <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> phase is important, because care aims and {{interventions}} change once this phase begins. In <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> phase, maximising comfort is paramount, even if doing so causes a deterioration of cognitive functions. In this delicate context, {{it is necessary to}} give special attention to the patient's personal wishes, spiritual guidance, and rituals, and to the emotional support of relatives. To initiate a care plan for <b>the</b> <b>dying,</b> health professionals must recognise and acknowledge when a patient enters <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> phase. This article describes hospital nurses' perspectives on the signs and symptoms that herald {{the onset of}} <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> phase in oncology patients, obtained via three focus group discussions. A broad range of signs and symptoms were reported and are presented here as a conceptual model. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether the signs and symptoms that mark the onset of <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> phase in oncology patients may be tumour-specific.

5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into <b>the</b> <b>die</b> before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills <b>the</b> <b>die,</b> which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> individual. <b>The</b> {{institutionalisation}} {{of death in}} the West has led to increasing public unfamiliarity with the actualities and banalities of dying. Accordingly, this thesis is concerned with the place where <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> individual is most commonly encountered: visual culture. How is <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> individual seen and screened? What structures are at play in their framing? And what is the spectator’s ethical relationship with – and moreover, responsibility towards – <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> individual? <b>The</b> introduction looks at imagery of dying which is used to “shock”. I then examine how, over the past century, “dying has been pushed further and further out of the perceptual world of the living” (Benjamin, 1936 / 2007), before turning to the use of visual culture in national health projects which seek to return <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> individual to <b>the</b> communal fold. I identify problems, which in turn open up new possibilities for spectatorship as an act of active citizenship and solidarity. The last two chapters consider how to foster public solidarity with <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> individual in visual culture. Through photography, then film, I examine texts which unsettle the status quo and help lay the foundations for an ethics of spectatorship in the encounter with <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> individual. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. <b>The</b> <b>die</b> that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So <b>the</b> <b>die</b> would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint had trouble getting the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.|$|E

Numismatist Kevin Flynn suggests that the first 100 pieces exhibit these special surfaces, and that this was done at Rossi's request for presentation to VIPs. One piece is known without a mint mark; this was most likely a trial piece, prepared and owned by Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock and later sold from his estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of <b>the</b> <b>die,</b> which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper.

This shot is then driven into <b>the</b> <b>die</b> by a hydraulic or mechanical piston.
