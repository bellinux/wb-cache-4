40|$|AbstractThe elastic shear {{buckling}} {{behavior of}} tapered plates with circular opening under shear stress {{has been studied}} numerically. Also, different aspect <b>ratios</b> and <b>tapering</b> <b>ratios</b> are studied numerically. Several values of circular opening diameters are considered in this study. In addition, tapered plates without openings are studied numerically for the different aspect <b>ratios</b> and <b>tapering</b> <b>ratios</b> to obtain the critical shear buckling under pure shear stresses. The boundary conditions of the studied plates {{are considered to be}} simply supported. The finite element method by ANSYS software is performed to simulate the behavior of the tapered plate. Results obtained from the elastic buckling analysis show that the small opening diameter has no significant effect on the critical shear loads. While the variation of <b>tapering</b> <b>ratios</b> give a minor effect on the critical shear load ratios, this is for large aspect ratios. In addition, the critical shear load ratios increase when the <b>tapering</b> <b>ratios</b> increase. Based on the results, proposed expressions for calculating the critical shear loads are presented for the tapered plates with and without openings. The proposed expressions show a good agreement with the results obtained from the elastic buckling analysis and are on the conservative side when compared with the numerical results...|$|R

Manually driven full span Fowler type Wortmann flaps emerge from the trailing edge between rollers, increasing the chord by 200 mm (7.9 in) over the untapered inner wing and by 80 mm (3.2 in) at the tip. Overall the flaps produce a 25% increase in wing area. Their trailing edges carry ailerons outboard and plain camber changing flaps inboard. Above wing, mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are placed at about mid span.|$|E

50|$|Although {{nominally}} {{a development}} {{of his earlier}} DFS Rhönsperber, Hans Jacobs' Sperber Senior was a completely new design intended to improve {{on the performance of}} its predecessor and to accommodate larger pilots. It was a shoulder wing aircraft with a double straight tapered gull wing, built around two spars and fabric covered apart from the leading edge from the front spar forward and the wing roots, which were plywood skinned. The wing roots were carefully faired into the fuselage. The inner panels, filling about one third of the span had only slight taper, the sweep entirely on the trailing edge, and about 10° of dihedral. Outboard the taper was much stronger, with a <b>taper</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.45. Here the leading edge was slightly swept but there was no dihedral.

50|$|The Nimbus was a {{development}} of the SB-6 Nixope. The main differences are the shorter span, 15 m rather than 18 m, and the T-tail of the Standard class Nimbus. Wing construction was simplified {{by the introduction of}} a 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) long rectangular centre panel. Like its predecessor, the Nimbus was built from a mixture of wood and glass fibre. Its shoulder mounted wings are built around box spars with glass fibre flanges and covered with glass fibre laid over balsa.

50|$|It was wooden {{framed and}} mostly covered with plywood, though {{parts of the}} wing and all the rear control {{surfaces}} were fabric covered. Its one piece high wing was built around a single spar, well set back from the leading edge and with closely spaced (210 mm) ribs to preserve the laminar flow profile of the ply covered forward part. This covering included the plain, upper surface hinged ailerons and a torsion resisting D-box around the leading edge from the spar. There was 2° of dihedral. In plan the wing was straight tapered with a <b>taper</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.416 and 1° of sweep at the quarter chord line.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of pin <b>taper</b> tool <b>ratio</b> on {{friction}} stir welding of magnesium alloy AZ 31. Two pieces of AZ 31 alloy with thickness of 6 mm were friction stir welded by using conventional milling machine. The shoulder diameter used in this experiment is fixed at 18 mm. The <b>taper</b> pin <b>ratio</b> used are varied at 6 : 6, 6 : 5, 6 : 4, 6 : 3, 6 : 2 and 6 : 1. The rotational speeds that were used in this study were 500 rpm, 1000 rpm and 1500 rpm, respectively. The welding speeds used are 150 mm/min, 200 mm/min and 250 mm/min. Microstructure observation of welded area was studied by using optical microscope. Equiaxed grains were observed at the TMAZ and stir zone indicating fully plastic deformation. Tool pin diameter ratio 6 / 1 causes low heat input to the material because of small contact surface between tool surface and stirred materials compared to other tool pin diameter ratio. The grain size of stir zone increased with increasing of ratio of rotational speed to transverse speed due to higher heat input. It is observed that, worm hole is produced when excessive heat input is applied. To evaluate the mechanical properties of this specimen, tensile test was used in this study. Welded specimens using <b>taper</b> pin <b>ratio</b> 6 : 1 shows higher tensile strength compared to other <b>taper</b> pin <b>ratio</b> up to 204 MPa.

50|$|It is a wood-framed aircraft, {{covered with}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its wing was built around a single spar with ply {{covering}} from the spar around the leading edge and fabric aft. The smooth ply skin covers just over half the chord, matching the approximate distance over which the ideal NACA airfoil 654421 maintains laminar flow; the rest is fabric-covered, though the covering of the plain ailerons is a ply and fabric mixture. In plan the wing has a rectangular centre section reaching out to about 60% of the span. Its square tipped outer sections have a swept leading edge, giving them a 6° sweep at quarter chord and a <b>taper</b> <b>ratio</b> of 65%. The ailerons are each in two parts, operating differentially and occupying about 63% of the span; the rest of the trailing edge is filled with lift-increasing Fowler flaps. There are Schempp-Hirth type air brakes on the inner section at 57% chord. The wings are shoulder mounted with a dihedral of 2.5°.|$|E
50|$|Its wooden high {{gull wing}} had a {{rectangular}} centre section, occupying about 20% {{of the overall}} 26 m span and mounted with marked dihedral. On each side a pair of rearwards leaning N-form lift struts braced {{the end of this}} section to the lower fuselage longeron. The outer panels had no dihedral and were strongly straight tapered, with a <b>taper</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1:4.7, though the trailing edges were unswept. They were also strongly tapered in thickness. Its large area wing and consequent low wing loading meant the Obs flew slowly. The thin, narrow chord wing tips carried endplate fins; like those on some of Lippisch's Storch tailless gliders, these carried rudders that were coupled to the conventional rear rudder, assisting it and allowing the Obs to have a short fuselage. The trailing edge of each outer panel carried three equal span ailerons. The outer one, together with that on the other wing, acted as differential ailerons but the inner pair also served as camber changing flaps. There is some doubt whether or not the wing was fitted with inboard upper surface airbrakes; these may have been added as a result of test flying.|$|E
50|$|The Stakhanvetz {{was both}} {{innovative}} and highly efficient. Named in honour Alexey Stakhanov, a Soviet miner internationally celebrated {{for his work}} rate, it was a tandem two seat, wood and fabric sailplane with a shoulder wing distinguished by strong forward sweep. This then novel arrangement enabled the rear seat {{to be at the}} centre of gravity but forward of the wing, giving its occupant a clear downwards view. It also helped to prevent tip stalling, the precursor to a spin, without the disadvantage of washout at high speeds. The CAGI RII airfoil, a flat bottomed section, decreased in thickness to chord ratio along the span. Built around a single spar, the wing was also strongly straight tapered in plan, with a <b>taper</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.18. Near the roots the wing was plywood covered forward of a diagonal sub-spar; further out the ply covering ran around the leading edge from the main spar forming a D shaped torsion box. The rest of the wing was fabric covered, including the half span, tapered ailerons. The wing tips were fine, elliptical and down-turned to protect the wing on the ground.|$|E

Evanescent field-based sensors {{depend on the}} tapered area geometry {{which is one of}} the important factors for optimising the sensor performance as well as achieving better sensitivity and higher resolution. Tapering fabrication process needs to be controlled properly in order to achieve the optimal design. A two-dimensional model of the tapered sensor is proposed and simulated using Finite Element Analysis software, COMSOL Multiphysics. The light scattering phenomenon is visualized for taper and waist areas. The effects of the taper length, the waist length and the waist diameter have been explored in order to find the optimal geometries design. The model provides initial data to the designer to program and control the taper ration and the taper length the fabrication process in order to obtain the highest penetration depth at the highest resolution. The results show that the evanescent field is significantly high when the core diameter is close or below the wavelength. The output graph illustrates that when the <b>tapering</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases, more light propagate into the surrounding making the sensor more sensitive to the ambient changes.
