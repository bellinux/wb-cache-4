5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

25|$|The Irish Film {{industry}} has grew rapidly {{in recent years}} thanks largely to {{the promotion of the}} sector by Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Irish Film Board) and the introduction of heavy tax breaks.

500|$|Cillian Murphy ( [...] ; born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor {{of stage}} and screen. Since making his debut {{in his home}} country in the late 1990s, Murphy has also become a {{presence}} in British and American cinemas noted by critics for his performances in many independent and mainstream films. He {{is best known as}} Damien in <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>That</b> Shakes the Barley, Jim in 28 Days Later (2002), the Scarecrow in The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–12), Jackson Rippner in Red Eye (2005), Robert Capa in Sunshine (2007), Robert Fischer in Inception (2010) and Thomas Shelby in the BBC series Peaky Blinders.|$|E
500|$|In 2006 (2007 in North America), Murphy {{starred in}} Ken Loach's {{film about the}} Irish War of Independence and Civil War, <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>That</b> Shakes the Barley, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and became the most {{successful}} Irish independent film at the Irish box office. Murphy was especially keen on appearing in the film due to his intimate connections to Cork, where it was shot. Murphy had to audition six times {{for the role of}} Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphy considered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was [...] "tremendously proud" [...] of the film, remarking that the [...] "memories run very, very deep– the politics, the divisions and everybody has stories of family members who were caught up in the struggle". Critic Denby noted Murphy's moments of deep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training." [...] GQ UK presented Murphy with their 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>That</b> Shakes the Barley.|$|E

500|$|On 6 February, Leissègues was {{surprised}} at anchor by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, which had been taking on fresh supplies at Basseterre when news of Leissègues' arrival reached him. Joined by ships from the West Indian squadron, Duckworth's force was larger than Leissègues' and also {{had the advantage of}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> prevented the unprepared French squadron from escaping. Sailing westwards along the coast in a line of battle, Leissègues' flagship Impérial was the first to be attacked, eventually driving ashore along with the next in line, while three others surrendered at the Battle of San Domingo. Leissègues himself escaped ashore; the only surviving ships of his squadron were the frigates, all of which eventually returned to France later in the spring.|$|E
500|$|In late 2003, Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless {{supermarket}} stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in Intermission, {{which became}} the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>That</b> Shakes the Barley broke the record in 2006). Reflecting on his roles in 28 Days Later and the [...] "sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker" [...] in Intermission, Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune stated that Murphy brought [...] "fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, {{as much as his}} acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next Colin Farrell, albeit one who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres". Murphy had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama Cold Mountain. He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with Jude Law's character, and was only on location in Romania for a week. Murphy stated that it was a [...] "massive production", remarking that director Anthony Minghella was the calmest director he'd ever met. Murphy also had a role as a butcher in Girl with a Pearl Earring with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.|$|E
500|$|Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008), {{the sequel}} to Batman Begins, before {{starring}} in The Edge of Love—about a love quadrangle involving the poet Dylan Thomas—with Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and Matthew Rhys. Murphy also made a debut appearance in another medium—on a postage stamp: in July 2008, the Irish Post Office, An Post, released a series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of films recently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still from <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>That</b> Shakes the Barley. In 2009, Murphy starred opposite rock singer Feist and actor David Fox in The Water, directed by Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene. The 15-minute Canadian short film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to the end. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene {{and the prospect of}} making a silent movie, which he considered to be the [...] "hardest test for any actor". Murphy also starred in Perrier's Bounty, a crime dramedy from the makers of Intermission, in which he portrayed a petty criminal on the run from a gangster played by Brendan Gleeson.|$|E

[...] As additional firefighting resources arrived from stations throughout the Pacific Northwest and more heavy equipment became available, the fire lines were widened and extended all along the perimeter. [...] While the fire threatened some important archaeological sites, {{the size of the}} fire did not grow much over the weekend.

He asks the control panel scientist if the test can be aborted and is told [...] "yes", but it would ruin all their preparations in setting up timed measuring instruments.
