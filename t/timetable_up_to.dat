50|$|Binz benefited as Rügen's role as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} grew. This also increased {{the importance of the}} line again. Prora was a military out-of-bounds area in GDR times and large barracks were set up using the KdF blocks. Accordingly, the railway line became important for military traffic. Several express trains (D-Züge) bringing conscripts stopped at Prora. Depending on the summer <b>timetable,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> six pairs of express trains ran. They connected Binz, to places such as Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Erfurt, and, in the late 1980s, even Bratislava. Local passenger services were also relatively frequent; for example, in 1988 a total of twelve pairs of trains operated.|$|E

40|$|In September 1989, {{as part of}} its {{privatization}} program, the Government {{laid down}} an eight year <b>timetable</b> for opening <b>up</b> <b>to</b> retail competition the entire electricity market of England and Wales, phased over the period 1990 - 1998. It might be assumed that the Government {{was in a position to}} specify all the arrangements, and that this was part of a considered policy to facilitate the introduction and implementation of competition. But previous accounts suggest that the outcome was part of a deal between generators and regional companies to limit competition (Henney 1994), or was intended to set targets to force companies, regulators and government <b>to</b> come <b>up</b> with practical solutions (Helm 2004). The Department of Energy’s internal History of Electricity Privatisation, only now available, shows that there is merit in these last two suggestions. However, it also documents the significantly evolving views within Government as the implications of retail competition became clearer, not least for electricity contracts and for privatization of the coal industry. Initially, retail competition was hardly worth mentioning, later it was a mild concern that could be met by a small tranche of spot-price contracts, by July 1989 the plan was to introduce full competition immediately with short-term instead of long-term contracts. But the industry resisted, and in September 1989 the Government accepted the industry proposal of a franchise monopoly to enable a mix of short, medium and long-term contracts, though it insisted that the franchise should have an eight year limit. The approach may not be a model for others, but it may not be atypical of how governments actually behave in balancing conflicting objectives and practical constraints, save perhaps for the distinctive commitment to competition exhibited by the leading actors here.

5000|$|From 1838 onwards, Robert Saunders, the (Anglican) factory {{inspector}} for the West Riding, {{had been}} attempting to interest {{the government in}} a scheme for improving the education of factory children in the district. He got no satisfactory response from the government, but considerable interest from the local Anglican clergy and from the National Society, {{with whom he had}} discussed the scheme. (He {{does not appear to have}} tried to similarly involve local non-conformist clergy, or the British Society, whose schools and approach to religious instruction he considered inferior. Nor does he seem to have considered the omission significant; from consultation of the parents of factory children he thought [...] "Many would send their children to a school where the principle of Mahomet, or the worship of blocks and stones, were inculcated, without concerning themselves in the matter, if only the school-fee was less at such school than at the best school in the neighbourhood. Exceptions are happily to be found, but they are rare."). [...] In December 1840, the National Society sought his advice on how the central organisation could best supplement local efforts for the education of factory children in the district. [...] As a result of this collaboration, by the end of 1842, 940 children formerly attending factory schools were attending National Schools whose <b>timetables</b> were set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the work patterns of the children (who in most cases were, as a result of Saunders' urging of mill-owners, working half-days - as envisaged by Fox-Maule's Factory Bill of 1839) The children were free to attend any Sunday school of their parents choice (the breakdown was 340 Anglican, 22 Catholic, 578 Non-conformist) but whilst at the National Factory Schools they received Anglican religious instruction; no parent complained of this (but 20 or so Catholic children had gone to a Catholic school in preference to the National Schools.) [...] Meanwhile, Saunders had urged on Graham a scheme for [...] "Government Factory Schools"; these would be run and controlled by Anglicans, and the default religious education in them would be as in National Schools, but parents could withhold their children from the specifically Anglican elements (the withheld children to be given instruction in other school subjects instead), thus obtaining a non-denominational religious education matching that in British Schools.|$|R
