5|$|Chicago Tribunes Pulitzer Prize-winning {{architecture}} critic, Blair Kamin, {{praised the}} incorporation of various wildlife into <b>the</b> <b>decor</b> and numeours elements of the rehab resulting from the alliance of real estate developers and historic preservationists, but {{made it clear that}} Virgin Hotels Chicago is not the Four Seasons Hotel Chicago or Ritz-Carlton (Four Seasons). He describes this as a successful recycling of a second-tier historic building.|$|E
5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, <b>the</b> <b>décor</b> having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in {{the centre of the}} dining room, with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} and significant alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted a bedroom over it into a Drawing Room in 1758, created a Breakfast Room over the Hall in 1772, remodelled {{the southern part of}} the castle, and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to <b>the</b> <b>décor</b> of the castle are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E

5|$|By Vegas standards, the 75-seat {{restaurant}} is small, and <b>the</b> <b>decor</b> is understated, keeping {{the focus on}} the food. No flowers are allowed nor are the staff permitted to wear perfumes to eliminate competition with the aromas of the cuisine. The {{restaurant is}} open Wednesday through Sunday and closed on Monday and Tuesday. It has been rated with two Michelin stars, ranked {{as one of the best}} 101 Hotel Restaurants, been voted Restaurant of the year, and in 2015 was ranked by Gayot in its Top 40 Restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} are themed around {{the idea of}} a traditional Southern U.S. general store. Items used to decorate each store are authentic artifacts, including everyday objects from the early 1900s and after. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a wooden peg solitaire game on every table, and a stone fireplace with a deer head displayed above the mantel. In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and a traffic light. The peg games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee. <b>The</b> <b>decor</b> at each location typically includes artifacts related to the local history of the area, including antique household tools, old wall calendars and advertising posters, and antique photographs; these are centrally stored in a warehouse in Tennessee, where they are cataloged and stockpiled for future use by individual store locations.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} chateau of Versailles, the Grand Trianon {{underwent}} many changes and modifications {{during the reign}} of Louis XIV, especially the relocation of his apartment from the south wing to the north wing. However, significantly different from Versailles, was <b>the</b> <b>decor</b> of the Grand Trianon. Where Versailles' decor extolled the heroic actions of Louis XIV in the guise of Augustus, Alexander, and Apollo, this didactic component is not evident in <b>the</b> <b>décor</b> of the Grand Trianon. The style of the Grand Trianon reflected a more relaxed atmosphere and life-style that was removed from the constraints of protocol and etiquette found at Versailles.|$|E
50|$|Generally <b>the</b> <b>decors</b> of KPM Berlin are hand painted. The {{porcelain}} painters {{are free}} to interpret the motifs within the design specifications. When finished, the painter signs the porcelain he has decorated. Each piece of porcelain thus becomes a unique work of art.|$|R

50|$|Many Little-master cups are signed (especially lip cups), as the {{signature}} was often incorporated in <b>the</b> overall <b>decor.</b> <b>The</b> signatures are mostly by potters, {{probably because the}} potting was often of higher quality than the painting.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>decor</b> used on Downton Abbey {{inspired}} US Representative Aaron Schock to redecorate his congressional {{offices in}} a more luxurious style.

25|$|The {{color of}} a device neither {{identifies}} its voltage class nor power system. Because the colors are not identified by national standards, the purpose of color-coding a receptacle is set by the building owner.

25|$|The {{premises}} were remodelled in 1899 {{and had a}} U-shaped bar. The internal fittings {{were lost}} in further modernization. The property is now an Italian restaurant, <b>the</b> <b>decor</b> of which is in homage to Stevenson's Treasure Island. Surviving from 1899 is the timber Ionic pilastered frontage with the trademark of Rutherford and Company (dated 1834) in an arched panel above.|$|E
25|$|The layouts of both {{floors of}} “Maxim’s” have been preserved.

25|$|Athens {{became the}} great city of Greek theatre. Theatrical {{performances}} lasted eight consecutive hours and were performed {{as part of}} a competition in which a jury proclaimed a winner. While <b>the</b> <b>decor</b> of the provisional theatres was very simple, the permanent theatrical venues of ancient Athens eventually became more sumptuous and elaborate. No matter the performance venue, plays were performed by, at most, three actors, who wore masks to identify them with the characters they portrayed; they were accompanied by a chorus who sang and danced.|$|E
25|$|As a large {{passenger}} ship, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse {{was built}} to carry a maximum of 1,506 passengers: 206 first class; 226 second class; 1,074 third class.

However, following her refit of 1913, her crew space was increased to 800. <b>The</b> <b>décor</b> of ship was in the style of Baroque revival, overseen by Johann Poppe, who carried out all of the interior decoration. This was unique as usually a ship would have several interior designers.|$|E

On opening night, many figures from the hockey world were present, including Brendan Shanahan, Ken Daneyko and Henrik Lundqvist. <b>The</b> <b>décor</b> was meant to reflect an old New York style, with Andy Warhol originals and pictures of icons on the walls, as well as pictures of the New York Rangers, past and present.

25|$|St. Peter and St. Paul's {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied churches in Lithuania. The main author of <b>the</b> <b>decor</b> plan is not known. It could be the founder Pac, monks of the Lateran, or Italian artists. No {{documents}} survive to explain the ideas behind the decorations, therefore various art historians attempted to find one central theme: Pac's life and Polish–Lithuanian relations, teachings of Saint Augustine, Baroque theater, etc. Art historian Birutė Rūta Vitkauskienė identified several main themes of the decor: structure of the Church as proclaimed at the Council of Trent with Saint Peter as the founding rock, early Christian martyrs representing Pac's interest in knighthood and ladyship, themes relevant to the Canons Regular of the Lateran, and themes inherited from previous churches (painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and altar of Five Wounds of Christ). <b>The</b> <b>decor</b> combines a great variety of symbols, from local (patron of Vilnius Saint Christopher) to Italian saints (Fidelis of Como), from specific saints to allegories of virtues. There are many decorative elements – floral (acanthus, sunflowers, rues, fruits), various objects (military weapons, household tools, liturgical implements, shells, ribbons), figures (puttos, angels, soldiers), fantastical creatures (demons, dragons, centaurs), Pac's coat of arms, masks making various expressions – but they are individualized, rarely repeating. The architects and sculptors borrowed ideas from other churches in Poland (Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków, Sigismund's Chapel of Wawel Cathedral) and Italy (St. Peter's Basilica, Church of the Gesù).|$|E

The cast included Altynai Asylmuratova as Nikiya, Darcey Bussell as Gamzatti and Irek Mukhamedov as Solor. Makarova has since staged her production for many companies throughout the world, including the Ballet of La Scala (who have recently filmed their production and released it onto to DVD), the Australian Ballet and the Royal Swedish Ballet.|$|E
