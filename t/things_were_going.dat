25|$|Prince Edward County Commonwealth's Attorney James Ennis said McCroskey's {{anger over}} his failing {{relationship}} with Emma Niederbrock {{led to the}} killings. Ennis says McCroskey was angered by some text messages Emma sent {{while they were in}} Michigan.

But Laemmle denied their requests and even terminated Mintz's contract, opting to have the Oswald cartoons produced right on the Universal lot instead.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Proctor's Pennsylvania Artillery manned a 4-gun lunette on a knoll that {{overlooked}} Chadds Ford. Two {{of the guns}} were French-made 4-pounders, another was a 3-pounder Hessian prize that was rebored as a 6-pounder and the last was an 8-inch howitzer cast in Philadelphia. At 8:00–9:00 am an artillery duel began between the American guns and the British artillery {{on the west side}} of Brandywine Creek. Sometime afterward, Washington conferred with Proctor on how <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> At 5:30 pm the British mounted a major assault across the creek. Firing canister shot, Proctor's guns caused considerable casualties before the British successfully stormed the lunette. The Americans claimed to have saved two of the cannons.|$|E

The injured Brian Luckhurst took 37 minutes over his duck before was dismissed by Doug Walters (1/10) and England took {{an hour to}} reach 11/1. John Edrich (30) and Keith Fletcher (33) took the score to 60/1, but Dell (2/32) took his first Test wicket – Edrich caught by Greg Chappell – and England collapsed to 98/5 thanks to the leg-spinners Terry Jenner (3/42) and Kerry O'Keeffe (3/48), who were kept on even when the new ball became available.

25|$|The Astros {{were playing}} great {{baseball}} throughout the season. José Cruz and Enos Cabell both stole 30 bases. Joe Niekro {{had a great}} year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. J. R.

Joe Sambito came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> as they should {{for a team that}} could win the west. The Astros and Reds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the Astros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. That would be how it would end. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89–73 and 1½ games behind the NL winner Reds.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

25|$|Against such methods the NVA/VC uses {{a variety}} of approaches. If the {{objective}} was to cause attrition, NVA regulars would sometimes fight directly with their opponents using conventional tactics, particularly on the DMZ against the US Marines, and in remote border areas near Laos and Cambodia. Such attrition objectives were sometimes part of the North's overall strategy of drawing the Americans into remote areas, and away from key population clusters dominated or contested by the Viet Cong. Some American postwar memoirs comment favorably on the bravery and tactical discipline of the NVA in these encounters. To stem an advance from airmobile enemies NVA troops sometimes held their ground in prepared fortifications, buying time for their comrades to maneuver elsewhere. PAVN forces also attempted with limited success to attack the quickly constructed firebases from which the lethal firepower issued. Gaps between maneuvering US units were infiltrated and attacks mounted. Ambushes were also executed. Another tactic was fighting close to US units, so close that deadly American artillery and air strikes were discouraged for fear of hitting their own troops. If <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> badly, PAVN forces withdrew to cross-border sanctuaries, where American ground forces were forbidden to follow. The fast-moving US operations, {{where there was no}} time for the usual months of communist initiative and rehearsed preparations, could catch PAVN off-guard, and casualties against US forces could be heavy. In Operation Dewey Canyon for example, US after-action reports claim some 1,617 NVA killed, for a loss of 121 marines killed, and the capture of hundreds of tons of munitions, equipment and supplies.|$|E

500|$|Tierney {{continued}} his political activism in the 1990s and early 2000s by donating to {{local and national}} campaigns and headed George W. Bush's outreach to Catholics in the 2000 Presidential Election. Tierney was credited with helping generate votes for Bush and helping him win important states like Ohio and Missouri. Tierney also frequently appeared as a conservative voice on WPVI-TV's Inside Story. In 2003 Tierney headed Sam Katz's third campaign for mayor of Philadelphia, which he lost to incumbent mayor John F. Street. During the campaign, Tierney {{was involved in a}} highly publicized dispute with Neil Oxman. Oxman was a political consultant and friend of Sam Katz who worked on Katz's 1999 run for mayor. Oxman left Katz's 2003 campaign because he was unable to work with Tierney, saying Tierney was a [...] "shameless self-promoter" [...] and [...] "full of bullshit". Katz praised Tierney, who he said was full of optimism, which Katz said was a great asset when <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> poorly in the campaign and in Katz's personal life.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> pretty good for a little while".

500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Psycho Therapy", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown {{into one of the}} most popular Ramones' song.

[...] The next track is another cover song, [...] "Time Has Come Today", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to have more of a [...] "garage" [...] feel to it, as compared to the original. [...] "My-My Kind of a Girl" [...] was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as [...] a [...] "lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur." [...] Dee Dee's [...] "Time Bomb", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be [...] "more ridiculous than frightening."

500|$|The 2003 season {{started with}} a 2916 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton. The win was notable because Highlander Willie Walker kicked eight {{penalties}} which was a competition record. They then defeated the Stormers and Bulls before losing to coach Laurie Mains’ old team the Cats in Johannesburg. Winger Aisea Tuilevu was banned for foul play following the match, and Highlander’s captain Tane Randell publicly criticised the South African judicial process. Their second loss of the season came when they played the Crusaders at Carisbrook. The Crusaders won 1716 to record to first loss for the Highlanders at Carisbrook since the 1999 finalwhich was also lost to the Crusaders. The Highlanders had gone three seasons, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and 16 games unbeaten at Carisbrook. The Highlanders then defeated the Blues 2211 to retain the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy, and inflict the only loss of the season on the Blues who {{would go on to}} win the 2003 Championship. Following the Highlander’s 4519 defeat of the Brumbies on 25 April it was revealed that a rift had developed between coach Laurie Mains and some of the senior players in the squad. Anton Oliver was branded the ringleader by Mains, but Carl Hoeft said of the conflict; [...] "Anton got hung out as ringleader, {{but a lot of the}} players had issues with the way <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> and I was one of themI’m not going to hide from that". The Highlanders lost to the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 3 May, but were in a position to qualify for the semi-finals if they defeated the Queensland Reds in the last round. The Reds won 2823 and their season was over. The defeat was Mains’ last match as coach; he resigned as was replaced by his assistant Greg Cooper.|$|E
