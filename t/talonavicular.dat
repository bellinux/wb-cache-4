5|$|Parker's injury {{extended}} into {{the beginning of}} the 2015–16 NBA season. He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for the Bucks but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he ramped up his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his <b>talonavicular</b> joint in the right mid-foot causing him to be expected to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he began to come off the bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. On February 19, he tied his career high with 23 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He surpassed that total the following night, recording career highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 117–109 double-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 29, Parker set a new career high with 36 points in a 128–121 Bucks victory over the Houston Rockets.|$|E

50|$|Chopart's fracture-{{dislocation}} is a dislocation of the mid-tarsal (<b>talonavicular</b> and calcaneocuboid) joints of the foot, {{often with}} associated fractures of the calcaneus, cuboid and navicular.|$|E
5000|$|The dorsal <b>talonavicular</b> {{ligament}} is a broad, thin band, which {{connects the}} neck of the talus to the dorsal surface of the navicular bone; it is covered by the Extensor tendons.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{comprises}} early {{reduction of}} the dislocation, and frequently involves open reduction internal fixation to restore and stabilise the <b>talonavicular</b> joint. Open reduction and fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint is occasionally required.|$|E
50|$|The <b>talonavicular</b> and calcaneocuboid joints (i.e. {{between the}} talus and navicular bones, and the calcaneus and cuboid bones) form the {{so-called}} {{transverse tarsal joint}} or Chopart's joint. It has two axes of motion. Inversion and eversion occur about a longitudinal axis oriented 15 degrees upward from the horizontal plane and 9 degrees medially from the longitudinal axis of the foot. Flexion and extension occur primarily about an oblique axis oriented 52 degrees upward from the horizontal plane and 57 degrees anteromedially (forward-inward). In vitro <b>talonavicular</b> motion is 7 degrees flexion-extension and 17 degrees pronation-supination; while calcaneocuboid motion is 2 degrees flexion-extension and 7 degrees pronation-supination.|$|E
50|$|Os supranaviculare (or <b>talonavicular</b> bone, Latin: os talonaviculare dorsale) is an {{accessory}} bone of the foot. It has an incidence of about 1,6 %. Its presence {{may lead to}} a false diagnosis of an avulsion fracture of the navicular bone.|$|E
50|$|On weightbearing projectional radiography, pes cavus can be {{diagnosed}} and graded by several features, {{the most important}} being medial peritalar subluxation, increased calcaneal pitch (variable) and abnormal talar-1st metatarsal angle (Meary's angle). Medial peritalar subluxation can be demonstrated by a medially rotated <b>talonavicular</b> coverage angle.|$|E
50|$|Triple {{arthrodesis}} is {{a surgical}} procedure whose {{purpose is to}} relieve pain in the rear part of the foot, improve stability of the foot, {{and in some cases}} correct deformity of the foot, by fusing of the three main joints of the hindfoot: the subtalar joint, calcaneocuboid joint and the <b>talonavicular</b> joint. It is commonly carried out on patients with joint degeneration resulting from arthritis or a severe flat foot deformity.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{radiography}} {{is usually}} the initial assessment tool when a calcaneal fracture is suspected. Recommended x-ray views are (a) axial, (b) anteroposterior, (c) oblique and (d) views with dorsiflexion and internal rotation of the foot. However, conventional radiography is limited for visualization of calcaneal anatomy, especially at the subtalar joint. A CT scan is currently the imaging study of choice for evaluating calcaneal injury and has substituted conventional radiography in the classification of calcaneal fractures. Axial and coronal views are obtained for proper visualization of the calcaneus, subtalar, calcaneocuboid and <b>talonavicular</b> joints.|$|E
50|$|The complex {{motion of}} the {{subtalar}} joint occurs in three planes and produces subtalar inversion and eversion. Along with the transverse tarsal joint (i.e. <b>talonavicular</b> and calcaneocuboid joint), the subtalar joint transforms tibial rotation into forefoot supination and pronation. The axis of rotation in the joint is directed upward 42 degrees from the horizontal plane and 16 degrees medially from the midline of the foot. However, together, the subtalar facets form a screw or Archimedean spiral, right-handed in the right foot, about which subtalar motion occurs. So, during subtalar inversion, the calcaneus also rotates clockwise and translates forward along the axis of the screw. Average subtalar motion is 20-30 degrees inversion and 5-10 degrees eversion. Functional motion during the gait cycle is 10-15 degrees (the heel strikes the ground in slight inversion followed by quick eversion).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Arthrodesis of the {{subtalar}} joint, triple arthrodesis (involving the subtalar, <b>talonavicular,</b> and calcaneocuboid joints), double arthrodesis (involving the <b>talonavicular</b> and calcaneocuboid joints), arthro-desis of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint, and arthrodesis of the calcaneocuboid joint were simulated in a cadaver model, and {{the range}} of motion of each joint not in-volved in the simulated arthrodesis was measured with a three-dimensional magnetic space tracking system. The excursion of the posterior tibial tendon was also measured under all of these conditions.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Osteoarthritis of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint {{caused by}} inflammatory, degenerative, and {{post-traumatic}} arthritis has been commonly described, and isolated arthrodesis for <b>talonavicular</b> joint has usually been performed for such conditions. However, arthritis accompanied by pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone {{is an extremely}} rare case, and {{to the best of}} our knowledge, isolated arthrodesis for this situation has not been previously described in any published reports. Case presentation The patient was a 39 -year-old Japanese man. He had complained of pain in his left middle foot since a fall from his motorcycle six months previously. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone. MRI indicated mild arthritic change in the <b>talonavicular</b> joint and avascular necrosis of the navicular bone. We performed an isolated arthrodesis of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint with two 6. 5 mm cancellous screws. One year after the operation, radiographical bone union had been obtained, and the patient reported no pain and complete satisfaction with the result. Conclusions Isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis is one of the effective procedures for the treatment of traumatic <b>talonavicular</b> arthritis with pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone both in providing pain relief and functional improvement. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Treatment of {{displaced}} tarsal navicular body fractures usually consists of open reduction and internal fixation. However, {{there is little}} literature reporting results of this treatment and correlation to fracture severity. METHODS We report the results of 24 patients treated in our institution over a 12 -year period. Primary outcome measurements were Visual-Analogue-Scale Foot and Ankle score (VAS-FA), AOFAS midfoot score, and <b>talonavicular</b> osteoarthritis at final follow-up. According to a new classification system reflecting <b>talonavicular</b> joint damage, 2 -part fractures were classified as type I, multifragmentary fractures as type II, and fractures with <b>talonavicular</b> joint dislocation and/or concomitant talar head fractures as type III. Spearman's coefficients tested this classification's correlation with the primary outcome measurements. Mean patient age was 33 (range 16 - 61) years and mean follow-up duration 73 (range 24 - 159) months. RESULTS Average VAS-FA score was 74. 7 (standard deviation [SD] 16. 9), and average AOFAS midfoot score was 83. 8 (SD = 12. 8). Final radiographs showed no <b>talonavicular</b> arthritis in 5 patients, grade 1 in 7, grade 2 in 3, grade 3 in 6, and grade 4 in 1 patient. Two patients had secondary or spontaneous <b>talonavicular</b> fusion. Spearman coefficients showed strong correlation of the classification system with VAS-FA score (r = - 0. 663, P <. 005) and <b>talonavicular</b> arthritis (r = 0. 600, P =. 003), and moderate correlation with AOFAS score (r = -. 509, P =. 011). CONCLUSION At midterm follow-up, open reduction and internal fixation of navicular body fractures led to good clinical outcome but was closely related to fracture severity. A new classification based {{on the degree of}} <b>talonavicular</b> joint damage showed close correlation to clinical and radiologic outcome.

40|$|Background: In {{the current}} {{discussion}} of surgical treatment of arthroses in the ankle joint, arthrodesis is {{in competition with}} artificial joint replacement. Up until now, no valid biomechanical findings have existed on the changes in intraarticular loads following arthrodesis. One argument against tibiotalar arthrodesis is the frequently associated, long-term degeneration of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint, which {{can be attributed to}} changes in biomechanical stresses. Methods: We used a dynamic model to determine the changes in intraarticular forces and peak-pressure in the <b>talonavicular</b> joint and in the calcaneocuboid joint on 8 cadaver feet under stress in a simulated stance phase following tibiotalar arthrodesis. Results: The change seen after arthrodesis was a tendency of relocation of average force and maximum pressure from the lateral onto the medial column of the foot. The average force increased from native 92 N to 100 N upon arthrodesis in the <b>talonavicular</b> joint and decreased in the calcaneocuboid joint from 54 N to 48 N. The peak pressure increased from native 3. 9 MPa to 4. 4 MPa in the <b>talonavicular</b> joint and in the calcaneocuboid joint from 3. 3 MPa to 3. 4 MPa.

40|$|Background: Two {{operative}} {{approaches are}} commonly used for isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis: the medial and the dorsal approach. It is recognized that access to the lateral aspect of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint can be limited when using the medial approach, {{and it is our}} experience that using the dorsal approach addresses this issue. We performed an anatomical study using cadaver specimens, to compare the amount of articular surface that can be accessed by each operative approach. Methods: Medial and dorsal approaches to the <b>talonavicular</b> joint were performed on each of 11 cadaveric specimens (10 fresh frozen, 1 embalmed). Distraction of the joint was performed as used intraoperatively and the accessible area of articular surfaces was marked for each of the 2 approaches using a previously reported technique. Disarticulation was performed and the marked surface area was quantified using an immersion digital microscribe, allowing a 3 -dimensional virtual model of the articular surfaces to be assessed.

40|$|The <b>talonavicular</b> joint {{as part of}} the coxa pedis plays {{a pivotal}} role in the overall motion of the foot. The {{necessity}} for <b>talonavicular</b> fusion arises from isolated arthritis of posttraumatic, rheumatoid, degenerative, or idiopathic etiology. Posttraumatic arthritis is seen after malunited mid-tarsal (Chopart) fracture-dislocations and is frequently accompanied by malalignment due to an imbalance between the medial and lateral columns of the foot. In these cases a corrective arthrodesis becomes necessary. In cases of poor bone stock or arthritis of the calcaneocuboid joint, a double arthrodesis is preferred over isolated <b>talonavicular</b> fusion. Fusion with mini-plates is biomechanically superior to fusion with screws and especially staples, the latter being associated with non-union rates of up to 37 %. <b>Talonavicular</b> fusion allows reproducible pain reduction in isolated arthritis with subjective patient satisfaction of between 86 % and 100 % in a literature review. The substantial reduction of movement in the triple joint complex leads to overload of the adjacent joints with development of arthritis in about 30 % in the medium ter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{describe}} the clinical results of isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis in rare Müller-Weiss disease, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the navicular in adults. From June 2001 to April 2010, we performed isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis on 13 feet of 13 patients (mean age: 55. 6 years) with Müller-Weiss disease.

The average modified American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score improved from 48. 5 points preoperatively to 87. 2 points at final follow-up (mean 51 months, range 10 – 114 months). Union was achieved in 10 cases (76. 9 %). If the subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints are relatively healthy, isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis may be an effective and reliable surgical option for treatment of Müller-Weiss disease that is resistant to conservative treatment...|$|E

Conclusion The increase in imparted force and peak pressure on the medial column of the foot following tibiotalar arthrodesis, as was demonstrated in a dynamic model, biomechanically explains the clinically observed phenomenon of cartilage degeneration on the medial dorsum of the foot in the long term. As a clinical conclusion from the measurements, it would be desirable to reduce the force imparted on the medial column with displacement onto the lateral forefoot, say by suitable shoe adjustment, in order to achieve a more favourable long-term clinical result. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The foot {{is often}} {{affected}} {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis. Subtalar joints are involved more frequently than ankle joints. Deformities of subtalar joints often lead to painful flatfoot and valgus deformity of the heel. Major contributors to the early development of foot deformities include <b>talonavicular</b> joint destruction and tibialis posterior tendon dysfunction, mainly due to its rupture. Methods Between 2002 and 2005 we performed isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis in 26 patients; twenty women and six men. Tibialis posterior tendon dysfunction was diagnosed preoperatively by physical examination and by MRI. <b>Talonavicular</b> fusion was achieved via screws in eight patients, memory staples in twelve patients and a combination of screws and memory staples in six cases. The average duration of immobilization after the surgery was four weeks, followed by rehabilitation. Full weight bearing was allowed {{two to three months}} after surgery. Results The mean age of the group {{at the time of the}} surgery was 43. 6 years. MRI examination revealed a torn tendon in nine cases with no significant destruction of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint seen on X-rays. Mean of postoperative followup was 4. 5 years (3 to 7 years). The mean of AOFAS Hindfoot score improved from 48. 2 preoperatively to 88. 6 points at the last postoperative followup. Eighteen patients had excellent results (none, mild occasional pain), six patients had moderate pain of the foot and two patients had severe pain in evaluation with the score. Complications included superficial wound infections in two patients and a nonunion developed in one case. Conclusions Early isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis provides excellent pain relief and prevents further progression of the foot deformities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and tibialis posterior tendon dysfunction. </p...|$|E
40|$|A simple dowel {{arthrodesis}} of the <b>talonavicular</b> {{joint in}} {{an early stage of}} destruction can reduce pain and prevent the development of valgus deformity in the rheumatoid hindfoot. Previously, we used autogenous dowels made from the iliac crest. In order to facilitate the operation and to get a better fitting dowel, we tried defatted cancellous allograft dowels from which marrow tissue had been re-moved. The dowels were prepared from femoral heads in our surgical bone bank. At operation, the dowels were embedded in fresh marrow aspirate from the iliac crest and the arthrodeses were stabilized with a staple. Results were evaluated by clinical examination and radiography. The results of four patients were compared with an earlier study of eight patients using autogenous dowels taken from the iliac crest. With both techniques, the patients were relieved of pain in the <b>talonavicular</b> joint, but some had pain from other hindfoot joints. With autogenous dow-els, all eight patients healed with radiographic bony union, but with allogenous dowels, the four patients developed fibrotic nonunion. The results indicate that <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis should be made using only autologous dowels...|$|E
40|$|Congenital <b>talonavicular</b> {{coalition}} is reported less frequently than talocalcaneal or calcaneonavicular coalition and represent approximately 1 % of all tarsal coalitions. Although reportedly transmitted as an autosomal-dominant disorder, tarsal coalition may be inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. It {{has been associated}} with various orthopaedic anomalies, including symphalangism, clinodactyly, a great toe shorter than the second toe, clubfoot, calcaneonavicular coalition, talocalcaneal coalition, and a ball-and-socket ankle. Patients with <b>talonavicular</b> coalitions are usually asymptomatic and rarely undergo surgical treatment. We report the case of a 24 -year-old woman with symptomatic bilateral <b>talonavicular</b> coalitions and previously unreported associated anomalies (nail hypoplasia and metatarsus primus elevatus) and review the relevant literature. The patient underwent surgery (calcaneocuboid joint distraction arthrodesis and a proximal plantar flexion osteotomy with a dorsal open wedge of the first metatarsal). At 1 -year followup, she was pain-free with better alignment of both feet and showed radiographic consolidation of the arthrodesis. Although this condition is less likely to be clinically important than other tarsal fusions, it sometimes can be painful enough for the patient to undergo surgery...|$|E
40|$|Dorsal rotatory {{subluxation}} of the navicular, {{a common}} sequela of resistant surgically treated clubfeet, presents a challenging treatment problem. This subluxation typically progresses after posteromedial release. Patients develop a cavovarus foot deformity and complain of pain, gait problems, and difficulty with shoe wear. Previous attempts at soft tissue release and reduction {{have been largely}} unsuccessful. We reviewed 13 patients with dorsal rotatory subluxation of the navicular treated with <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis. The minimum followup after surgery was 6  months (average, 36  months; range, 6 to 93  months). At last followup 12 of 13 patients were symptom-free. The mean preoperative subluxation of 42 % {{was reduced to a}} mean of 6 % at last followup. We noted improvement in the talo-first metatarsal angle from an average of 18 º preoperatively to 8 º postoperatively. One patient treated by another surgeon with attempted <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis developed a nonunion; we observed no other complications. We believe <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis a reasonable option to correct the deformity and symptoms associated with dorsal rotatory subluxation of the navicular in a single surgical setting with a low complication rate...|$|E
40|$|Ankle {{injuries}} frequently {{occur in}} dancers. Among these injuries, {{only a few}} cases of talar subluxation {{have been reported in}} the literature. In our series, we diagnosed and treated 25 subtalar subluxations over a 1 -year period in the Ballet Béjart Lausanne company. The subluxations occurred after a grand plie on pointes or at the landing of a jump on demi-pointes, without any mechanism of ankle sprain. The dancer usually noted a sudden and sharp pain in the <b>talonavicular</b> joint and hindfoot with a feeling of "forward displacement" of the foot. At palpation, the <b>talonavicular</b> ligament, the anterior talofibular ligament, and the posteromedial part of the subtalar joint were painful. A limitation of the ankle extension and a clear hypomobility of the subtalar joint were noted. Under the effect of shearing forces on the midtarsal joint, a posteromedial subtalar subluxation occurred. Treatment consisted of a manipulation that reduced the subluxation. Continuous taping, which locks the <b>talonavicular</b> joint in the anterior direction, was recommended for 6 weeks. Dancing could be resumed in a swimming pool after 2 weeks, and on the ground after 3 to 4 weeks. We found that subluxation could recur, and that it could eventually become chronic...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{is often}} associated with deformities of the feet, and foot pain often arises in the <b>talonavicular</b> joint of patients with RA. The object {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint and walking ability. The subjects were 35 RA patients (10 feet in 5 males and 56 feet in 30 females) aged 34 - 87 years (mean: 70 years +/- 12. 1), with a disease duration from 1 - 54 years (mean: 14 years +/- 12. 1). MRI findings were classified as follows: Grade 1, almost normal; Grade 2, early articular destruction; Grade 3, moderate articular destruction; Grade 4, severe articular destruction; and Grade 5, bony ankylosis dislocation. Walking ability was classified into one of 9 categories ranging from normal gait to bedridden status according to the system of Fujibayashi. As the grade of MRI images became higher the walking ability decreased, and these parameters showed a correlation by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis (P = 0. 003). Thus, in the present cohort group of patients with RA, the deterioration of walking ability increased with the severity of destruction of the <b>talonavicular</b> joint. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Stage II {{flatfoot}} {{secondary to}} posterior tibial tendon insufficiency may be subclassified into mild (IIa) and severe (IIb) deformity {{based on the}} degree of <b>talonavicular</b> abduction.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionIn {{rheumatoid}} diseases, hindfoot arthrodesis abolishes {{pain and}} corrects deformity. The choice between selective and double arthrodesis {{depends on whether}} the hindfoot malalignment is fixed or not. Indications for surgery are well codified. The various types of arthrodesis have never been assessed together on a large series. We here report a series that is substantial in numbers and in follow-up. Materials and methodsA continuous single-center retrospective study included patients with native hindfoot inflammatory disease treated by arthrodesis between 1996 and 2009. ResultsAround 80 % of patients were followed up, for a mean 7 years. Fifty-four isolated <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodeses, 14 talocalcaneal arthrodeses and 39 double arthrodeses were performed. 96 % of patients had rheumatoid arthritis and 4 % spondylarthritis. 62 % were completely pain-free at follow-up. The satisfaction rate was 91 % and mean AOFAS score 70 %. 6 % of patients showed symptomatic non-union, mainly associated with <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis. In 22 % of double arthrodeses and 11 % of <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodeses, ankle status required surgical revision. In double arthrodesis, there was no correlation between hindfoot deviation and secondary deterioration in ankle status. Talocalcaneal arthrodesis was associated with radiologic hindfoot varus, both preoperatively and at follow-up. DiscussionNon-union was the main complication in <b>talonavicular</b> arthrodesis. The rate of secondary ankle surgery was significantly elevated in double arthrodesis. These findings support Suckel's cadaver studies, which, in 2007, reported early deterioration in ankle status in double arthrodesis, due to mechanical overloading. Talocalcaneal arthrodesis proved reliable and simple, free of major complications and with a 100 % satisfaction rate. ConclusionDouble arthrodesis showed the greatest benefit in terms of restoring foot architecture, but {{was associated with a}} higher rate of deterioration in ankle status. Preventive double arthrodesis is not recommended in case of isolated arthritis with reducible hindfoot malalignment. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Retrospective study...|$|E
