By comparing the spectrum to computed models of stellar evolution, the age, mass, radius and luminosity of Tau Ceti can be estimated.

Through such means, the radius of Tau Ceti has been measured to be [...] of the solar radius. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> size that is expected for a star with somewhat lower mass than the Sun.|$|E

500|$|During cosmic {{nucleogenesis}} of the elements, {{large amounts}} of neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars. Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system (it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen, helium, oxygen and carbon), it is very rare on Earth. It composes about 18.2 ppm of air by volume (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same as the molecular or mole fraction), and a smaller fraction in Earth's crust. The reason for neon's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner (terrestrial) planets is that neon [...] is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids. As a result, it escaped from the planetesimals under {{the warmth of the}} newly ignited Sun in the early Solar System. Even the outer atmosphere of Jupiter is somewhat depleted of neon, although for a different reason. It is also lighter than air, causing it to escape even from Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

2500|$|McCarthy {{records that}} the Japanese forces {{in front of}} Sanananda {{numbered}} about 5,500 including the hospitalised. No date is given but in context of text, this might be mid-December. The Center of Military History publication states, [...] "enemy strength in the Sanananda area was therefore between four and five thousand". No date is given but the context suggests this is at or after mid-December. Bullard reports a resupply from the Mambare River to supply approximately 5,000 men. No date is given but the context suggests <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time that Buna fell but before 8 January. It may likely have occurred {{at about the same}} time as the reinforcement that arrived just before the new year. Milner records, [...] "General Yamagata had some 5,000 troops at the beachhead (including the sick and wounded), but the men had almost nothing to eat and every Japanese in the area faced death by starvation." [...] Bullard gives the strength immediately prior to the fall as 4,000. This gives a detailed breakdown of the fate of the defenders. However, Bullard gives the standing strength of the garrison {{at about the same time}} and on the same page as 5,000.

2500|$|Further {{debate among}} analysts arose {{following}} the January 2017 {{presentation of the}} unit's price and specifications. Several noted that the Switch's price point of $299.99 was higher than the anticipated $250; these analysts observed that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same cost as the current Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, but the Switch {{does not appear to}} be as powerful as these units. Some pointed to the small numbers of launch titles as a concern, with the success of the Switch being tied to the critical reception to 1-2-Switch, a key launch title aimed to showcase the Joy-Con technology. Other analysts were more optimistic, stating that the higher price and online subscription cost help to distinguish the Switch as a more robust system compared to Nintendo's previous consoles, and would likely sell better than the Wii U, with [...] being a key sales driver. Some added that the console fills an appropriate gap in hardware for those seeking more complex gameplay that is not offered in tablet and mobile gaming but don't have the need to purchase a powerful [...] "boxy" [...] console. Most analysts agreed that the success of the Switch depends on Nintendo's support and avoiding mistakes the company had made in marketing and promoting the Wii U.|$|E
2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{ups and downs of}} life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how {{you have to take the}} ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
