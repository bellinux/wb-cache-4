500|$|During their {{marriage}} the Roseberys travelled extensively, usually without their children. In September 1883 the couple left {{their children in}} the care of the nannies and nursery maids, supervised by Rosebery's sister Lady Leconfield, for a long tour of America and Australia. Lady Rosebery owned large investments in North America, including ranches in Texas and mines in Montana. Their arrival in New York was widely reported, and a full and flattering description of Lady Rosebery was reported in The Herald. The newspaper went on to describe Rosebery as looking like a prosperous farmer. Lady Rosebery was very taken with California, from where she wrote: [...] "The inhabitants are very entertaining... the women are very handsome, <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> of dresses costing £80, [...] "fix up" [...] their faces very frequently and are generally divorced." [...] Having toured and been fêted in America, the party moved on to Australia via Honolulu. In Australia, Rosebery chose to indulge his habit of solitude, installing his wife in a hotel in Sydney, while he went off alone to tour the outback.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Green had {{her film}} debut, when {{director}} Bernardo Bertolucci cast {{her for the}} role of Isabelle in The Dreamers (2003), which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and graphic sex scenes. [...] Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause her career to [...] "have the same destiny as Maria Schneider", because of Schneider's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris. Green said that with Bertolucci's guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes but was embarrassed when her family saw the film. Her performance was well-received, and some compared her to Liv Tyler. Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, [...] "here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> of it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex." [...] Her next film was Arsène Lupin (2004), in which she portrayed Lupin's love interest. She enjoyed the light-hearted role, although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters.|$|E

2500|$|After the fair, Pawnee Bill’s Wild West Show {{brokered}} {{an agreement}} with the government to have Geronimo join the show, again under Army guard. The Indians in Pawnee Bill’s show were depicted as “lying, thieving, treacherous, murderous” monsters who had killed hundreds of men, women and children and would <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> of taking a scalp from any member of the audience, given the chance. [...] Visitors came to see how the “savage” had been “tamed,” and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious Apache “chief.” (Geronimo was not a chief.)

2500|$|In 1734, Johnson {{feared that}} he was {{suffering}} from a disease that would lead to him being deemed mad. He wrote, in Latin, a letter asking Samuel Swynfen, his godfather, about his health. Swynfen wrote back [...] "from the symptoms therein described, he could <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> better of his disorder, than it had a tendency to insanity; and without great care might possibly terminate in the deprivation of his rational faculties." [...] This Swynfen's response only caused Johnson to fear becoming insane even more. However, Swynfen soon after showed Johnson's letter to others because of its [...] "extraordinary acuteness, research, and eloquence", and this act was so upsetting to Johnson that he could never forgive Swynfen.|$|E

[...] "In my own village," [...] he told James Smith, [...] "they <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> of me." [...] The three years following the publication of The Borough were especially lonely for him. He did have his two sons, George and John, with him; they had both passed through Cambridge, one at Trinity and the other at Caius, and were now clergymen themselves, each holding a curacy in the neighbourhood, enabling them to live under the parental roof, but Mrs. Crabbe's health was now very poor, and Crabbe had no daughter or female relative at home to help him with her care.|$|E
2500|$|The cathedral that Wren {{started to}} build bears {{only a slight}} {{resemblance}} to the Warrant Design. In 1697, the first service {{was held in the}} cathedral when Wren was 65. There was still, however, no dome. Finally in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, Parliament had withheld for 14 years since 1697. The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a balustrade around the proof line. This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt parthian comment that [...] "ladies <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> well without an edging".|$|E
2500|$|In Pakistan, an {{editorial}} in Dawn, the country's oldest English-language newspaper, {{said that there was}} no doubt that the Facebook initiative [...] "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," [...] adding that it was [...] "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." [...] However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a [...] "knee-jerk reaction," [...] saying that, [...] "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," [...] and that the block might [...] "have played right into the hands of those who <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Lord Liverpool's {{government}} {{passed the}} Seditious Meetings Act 1817, Fitzwilliam supported it, although {{only as a}} temporary measure: [...] "I shall be sorry indeed should it pass permanently—it will operate an essential alteration in the constitution". After initially supporting it, he also came to think the suspension of habeas corpus in 1817 unnecessary after visiting the West Riding: [...] "I was led to <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> beyond ordinary powers [...] was called for...and therefore (whatever I might have thought before) that the prolongation of the suspension was not then necessary". In May that year intelligence of a planned uprising for June in the manufacturing areas of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire was acquired by the authorities and its leaders were arrested. A meeting of delegates planned {{three days before the}} uprising was due to start was intercepted by the yeomanry, who arrested the eleven who turned up.

2500|$|The ad fontes {{principle}} {{also had}} many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought {{a more profound}} and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism, and Neoplatonism, whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable {{to a life of}} Christian virtue. The line from a drama of Terence, Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (or with nil for nihil), meaning [...] "I am a human being, I <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> human alien to me", known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted veinas a comic rationale for an old man's meddlingbut it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by Seneca.

2500|$|Tommy Dorsey's first {{band was}} formed {{out of the}} remains of the Joe Haymes band, and so began Dorsey's long-running {{practice}} of raiding other bands for talent. If he admired a vocalist, musician or arranger, he would <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> of taking over their contracts and careers. [...] Dorsey had a reputation for being a perfectionist. He was volatile and also known to hire and fire (and sometimes rehire) musicians based on his mood. [...] The new band was popular from almost the moment it signed with RCA Victor with [...] "On Treasure Island," [...] the first of four hits for the new band in 1935. After his 1935 recording, however, Dorsey's manager cut the [...] "hot jazz" [...] that Dorsey had mixed with his own lyrical style and instead had Dorsey play pop and vocal tunes. Dorsey would keep his Clambake Seven as a Dixieland group that played during performances, too. The Dorsey band had a national radio presence in 1936, first from Dallas and then from Los Angeles. Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra took over comedian Jack Pearl's radio show in 1937.|$|E

2500|$|Later, in {{the week}} of episodes from 27 to 31 August, a fight breaks out {{involving}} the remaining suspects. Kat is seen tending to her lover's injuries, but viewers only saw his arm. Inisde Soap said the arm could eliminate at least one suspect, as it shows some skin and a dark top. They compared it to what the suspects were wearing earlier in the episode and said it could belong to Michael or Derek, but [...] "EastEnders might have a few tricks up their sleeves {{in order to put}} Jack and Max back in the mix." [...] When Kat receives flowers from her lover, Inside Soap opined that Derek would be [...] "the sort of bullish man [...] <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> of sending flowers to , unconcerned that it might expose the affair." [...] After Kat confesses to Alfie, she concentrates on her marriage, but Inside Soap noted that over a period of weeks, she had been seen [...] "drunkenly flirting with Max, [...] making small talk with Jack [...] and giving Derek some very guilty looks", though it was still not clear who was her lover. They said that Jack had become devoted to Sharon in that time and is bothered by the bond Sharon has with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), but the bold gestures made towards Kat, such has her lover buying back the ring she pawned, are Derek's style, and [...] "he's made no secret {{of the fact that he}} fancies Kat rotten!" [...] When Kat receives a candle with a note saying [...] "Light it. Put it in the window. I'll come knocking", Soaplife thought this was [...] "creepy" [...] and seemed to be something Derek would do.|$|E
2500|$|Mick was {{described}} by the BBC as a patriotic family man, who is a [...] "big softie" [...] after spending {{most of his life}} around women.

[...] Dyer said that Mick is in touch with his feminine side, and is [...] "the alpha male of the show without being a bully", and said it was [...] "not in an obvious way". He felt it was important that Mick was a family man, and called him a [...] "grafter". He called him a [...] "normal guy" [...] who is protective of his family. When he appeared on ITV panel show Celebrity Juice, he described Mick as [...] "a lovely fella" [...] who is [...] "not a villain." [...] He said that Mick would be a [...] "completely different landlord" [...] to Alfie, and said the character has [...] "a bit of [...] Butcher about [...] ". The Daily Mail called him [...] "big hearted", and All About Soap stated that he was [...] "no bad boy". Shane Richie said that Mick is [...] "not the hardman, but {{there is an element of}} that just underneath". Inside Soap said that Mick's battles are only verbal. They reported that Mick is enthusiastic about running his pub and has a [...] "proper, old-school cockney attitude". Dyer said that he wanted viewers to be confused by Mick's use of cockney rhyming slang and wanted to get as much [...] "cockney-ness" [...] into the role as he could. He said that his own use of slang was sometimes [...] "too out there" [...] for the show but he had tried to stop it being taken out.|$|E
