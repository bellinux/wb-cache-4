5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for <b>the</b> <b>Ordination</b> of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> of women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{tried unsuccessfully}} to obtain {{one of the two}} fellowships that {{exempted}} the holder from <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.|$|E

5|$|Marking {{documents}} is {{the most}} common use of arms in the Church today. A Roman Catholic bishop's coat of arms was formerly painted on miniature wine barrels and presented during <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> ceremony. Cardinals may place their coat of arms outside the church of their title in Rome. Impersonal arms are often used as the banner of a school or religious community.|$|E
5|$|When Bede {{was about}} 17 years old, Adomnán, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would {{probably}} have met the abbot during this visit, {{and it may be}} that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the Easter dating controversy. In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop, John, who was bishop of Hexham. The canonical age for <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> of a deacon was 25; Bede's early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> again performed by Bishop John.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

Archbishop John Bukovsky {{is quoted as saying}} that <b>the</b> <b>ordinations</b> were [...] "illicit but valid".|$|R

5|$|He was {{appointed}} Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow {{of a college}} at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, {{the terms of the}} Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, 15 {{conservative}} Episcopal churches {{voted to}} split from the Diocese of Virginia over <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> of openly gay bishops and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim {{affiliation with the}} larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to determine their church's affiliation, the diocese claimed the secessionist churches' buildings and properties. The resulting property law case, ultimately decided {{in favor of the}} mainline diocese, was a test for Episcopal churches nationwide.|$|E
5|$|While monasticism {{had existed}} in Chinese Buddhism, the Northern Celestial Masters {{were one of}} the first Daoist groups to {{practice}} it. Kou lived a monastic lifestyle on Songshan, known today for being the location of the Shaolin Monastery. Monasticism developed further during the Louguan phase of the Northern Celestial Masters due to this influence of Buddhism. During this period, a clear distinction developed between lay and monastic followers in Daoism. <b>The</b> <b>ordination,</b> precepts and way in which monks sought salvation were all influenced by Buddhism.|$|E

25|$|Pope Sergius III convoked a synod which annulled all <b>the</b> <b>ordinations</b> of Formosus and {{required}} all bishops ordained by Formosus to be re-ordained. It was alleged that Sergius {{managed to get}} the consent of the Roman clergy at the synod by threatening them with exile, violence or through the use of bribery. The decision to require reordination was very unpopular, and those affected at sees distant from Rome not only ignored the synod’s instructions, but wrote letters both condemning <b>the</b> revoking of <b>ordinations</b> and justifying validity of <b>the</b> original <b>ordinations.</b> <b>The</b> ruling was subsequently reversed again after his death.|$|R
5|$|Worship at St James' is {{in a style}} {{commonly}} found in the High Church and moderate Anglo-Catholic traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a robed choir singing psalms, anthems and responses {{in contrast to the}} great majority of churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> of women.|$|E
5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were not binding without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> of women as lay elders.|$|E
5|$|In 1138 King Stephen chose Theobald to {{fill the}} vacant archbishopric of Canterbury over Stephen's own brother Henry, the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped Stephen gain the throne of England. Stephen feared that Henry would be too {{powerful}} as archbishop, and would attempt to control the king. The election took place on 24December; Stephen was present with the papal legate, Alberic of Ostia, and {{a small group of}} barons and bishops, but Henry was absent overseeing <b>the</b> <b>ordination</b> of deacons. Most historians consider that Stephen arranged the election's timing to ensure Henry's absence. Henry believed that Theobald had been elected not only because of Stephen's concerns but also because Waleran of Meulan, the lay patron of Bec, was attempting to put his own man {{in one of the most}} powerful positions in England. Waleran and his twin brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, were Henry's chief rivals for Stephen's favour, and Henry disliked both of them intensely. Although Theobald was pious and well-educated, he had only become abbot the year before, and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery, which had already produced two archbishops of Canterbury, Lanfranc and Anselm. Theobald had no important family connections to advance his career, and few clerical allies.|$|E
50|$|The Roman Synod of 769 {{permitted}} {{and even}} prescribed {{the repetition of}} orders conferred by the antipope Constantine (Liber Pontificalis, ed. Duchesne, I, 408 sqq.).

In 881-82 Pope John VIII prescribed the reordination of Bishop Joseph of Vercelli, who had been ordained by the Archbishop of Milan, then under the ban of excommunication. On several occasions <b>the</b> <b>ordinations</b> conferred by Pope Formosus were declared null and were repeated.|$|R
