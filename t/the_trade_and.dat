5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whiskey trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's {{nickname}} became Fort Whoop-Up. The whiskey trade {{led to the}} Cypress Hills Massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873.

5|$|Decline {{in market}} demand {{combined}} with movement restrictions {{imposed by the}} Israeli military {{have led to a}} deterioration of the local economy, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> the stone-cutting industries. In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons began looking into agriculture to earn income. The most cultivated crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable segment of the population raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives. Much of the town's agricultural products are sold in Hebron.|$|E
5|$|The Amber Road was a European trade route {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> transport of amber.

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing <b>the</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E

The Crown lands were to be also affected, as in July 1626 the Swedes took Pillau and forced Duke George William, Elector of Brandenburg and vassal of the Commonwealth in the attacked Ducal Prussia, to assume a neutrality stance. The Swedish advance resulted in the take-over of the Baltic coastline up to Puck. Danzig (Gdańsk), which had remained loyal to the Commonwealth, was subjected to a naval blockade.|$|E
5|$|As traders sailed farther east, the voyages became {{longer and}} more expensivea Smaller {{enterprises}} were merged into larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began to stand out {{as one of the}} most important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of <b>the</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, McEwan's {{acquired}} <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> goodwill of Alexander Melvin & Co {{of central}} Edinburgh. By 1914, McEwan's bottled beers were distributed across the United Kingdom. In December 1930, McEwan's merged with Edinburgh rival William Younger's Brewery to form Scottish Brewers in a defensive move after the Great Depression diminished revenues. Each entity was initially run separately, and only certain financial and technological resources were amalgamated. During this period the company became an early pioneer of container beer, {{largely due to}} its dependence on exports, particularly to the Royal Navy, where beer might be stored on board ships {{for up to a}} year. The NAAFI continued to be an important McEwan's customer throughout the century. In the early 1930s, Jardine Matheson approached the company regarding a potential brewing venture in China, but McEwan's did not welcome the threat to their export business.|$|E
5|$|Most of the burghs were on {{the east}} coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, {{including}} Aberdeen, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. Although in the southwest Glasgow was beginning to develop and Ayr and Kirkcudbright had occasional links with Spain and France, sea trade with Ireland was much less profitable. In addition to the major royal burghs this era saw the proliferation of lesser baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts; excluded from international trade, they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands, relying on them for food and raw materials. The wool trade was a major export {{at the beginning of}} the period, but the introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> it began to decline as an export from the early 15th century and despite a levelling off, there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-16th century Low Countries. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large scale cloth production and only poor quality rough cloths seem to have been significant.|$|E
5|$|New England {{businessmen}} {{also tried}} to establish a market for ice in England during the 1840s. An abortive first attempt to export ice to England had occurred in 1822 under William Leftwich; he had imported ice from Norway, but his cargo had melted before reaching London. Fresh attempts were made by Jacob Hittinger who owned supplies at Fresh Pond, and Eric Landor, with assets at Wenham Lake, in 1842 and 1844 respectively. Of the two, Landor's venture was more successful and he formed the Wenham Lake Ice Company to export to Britain, building an ice depot on the Strand. Wenham ice was marketed as being unusually pure, possessed of special cooling properties, successfully convincing British customers to avoid local British ice, which was condemned as polluted and unhealthy. After some initial success, the venture eventually failed, {{in part because the}} English chose not to adopt chilled drinks {{in the same way as}} North Americans, but also because of the long distances involved in <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> the consequent costs of ice wastage through melting. Nonetheless, the trade allowed for some refrigerated goods to arrive in England from America along with ice cargos during the 1840s.|$|E

5|$|Other early leather {{preserving}} products {{included the}} Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English {{man by the}} name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under the brand name Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> population center of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|The Eskayas speak a Boholano dialect of Cebuano {{in daily}} life. Boholano-Bisaya is the dominantly used {{language}} among the languages spoken {{by the members}} of the Eskayan tribe.

However, they are better known for an auxiliary language, known as Eskayan, or Ineskaya, which is used for prayers, songs, and formal speeches. Lexically, Eskayan shows no clear relationship with any known language (however, considered to be an encryption of Cebuano) although there is strong but inconsistent Spanish influence. A striking feature of the language is its unusual phonotactics.|$|E
