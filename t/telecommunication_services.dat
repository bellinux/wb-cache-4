5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also felt {{throughout}} Nova Scotia. Winds peaked at 70mph (115km/h) in Lockeport, the strongest winds {{observed in the}} Canadian province. In Yarmouth, the storm's gusts were clocked at 60mph (100km/h) in Yarmouth. Trees were uprooted {{as a result of}} the strong winds. One tree fell into a home in Melville Cove, damaging the home's roof. Cabins were damaged in Summerville, and the garage of a lodge in Digby was blown out. A barn and associated equipment were destroyed in Pembroke. The strong winds also blew down numerous communication lines, disrupting <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> across Nova Scotia. Downed wires in Halifax caused a fire which scorched five buildings. Traffic in the city was also disrupted by the winds. In addition to infrastructure, crops were also heavily damaged. In Digby County, grain and corn plantations were damaged. Grain crops in Cumberland County also saw heavy losses. In Annapolis Valley, an important agricultural region in western Nova Scotia, 600,000barrels of apples were lost, resulting in CA$1.5million in damages. The lost apple production accounted for roughly half of the entire apple yield for the agricultural region. Despite the hurricane's rapid movement through the Canadian Maritimes, the storm still produced heavy rainfall. In Halifax, 3in (75mm) of rain was reported over the duration of the hurricane. However, 3.5in (90mm) of rain fell in Yarmouth in a 24-hour period.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was comparatively less in New Brunswick than in Nova Scotia, {{but was still}} considerable. The rough seas impacted ships offshore the province, disrupting the lobster industry. Two groups of lobster fishermen went missing in the Northumberland Strait; they were later found. Thousands of lobster traps and several wharves were either damaged or destroyed in the strait. Hundreds of boats were set adrift or sunk in the strait as well. Several boats in Rothesay and Westfield were also lost. A man in Dixon Point lost CA$1,000of live lobsters due to the storm. A wharf in Shediac was washed away. Fifty boats were sunk off Cap-Pelé, while in Greville, four scows were destroyed. The rising seawater inundated a bridge crossing the Millstream River under 3ft (0.9m) of water. A bridge crossing the Little River and another bridge in Cocagne were also damaged. Dykes in the Baie Verte area were damaged, resulting in {{thousands of dollars in}} damages. Further inland, winds caused infrastructural and agricultural damage. Winds peaked at 85mph (135km/h) at Lakeburn Airport. The strong winds disrupted power and <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Moncton. Streets were blocked by trees blown down by strong winds. Offshore, three yachts were destroyed. A tree fell onto the Gagetown United Church {{as a result of the}} winds, causing considerable damage. Grain and apple crops were also destroyed in Gagetown. In Saint John, chimneys were toppled. Flying debris injured several people, and power outages also greatly affected the city. High waves in conjunction with strong gusts scattered boats in the nearby Saint John River. Tents in the Sussex Military Camp were destroyed. The hurricane's effects resulted in a car accident which injured eight people. Though no fatalities were confirmed in New Brunswick, a person went missing in Bathurst, who was later presumed dead.|$|E

40|$|In many industrialized economies {{there is}} an ongoing {{transition}} {{in the market for}} <b>telecommunication</b> <b>service</b> provision from uncontested monopoly over contested markets to de facto competition. Swedish Telecom faces emerging competition from national entrants as well as international <b>telecommunication</b> <b>service</b> providers, the latter group posing the most serious challenges. The transition from a national monopoly to a competitive environment sets a new agenda of strategic options for managing technological transitions as well as for managing internationalization and diversification. Given that technology-based internationalization of the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>service</b> industry will take place, a possible scenario is the development of systems competition, natural oligopolies and a polarized industry, possibly followed by protectionistic anti-competitive reactions. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} year of the colony, the {{harbourmaster}} was appointed to perform the postal services for the colony. A General Post Office was proclaimed in St Georges Terrace in 1835, and in 1841 a Postmaster General was appointed. The colonial Posts and Telegraph Department took over control of Perth's telegraph services in 1871, and telephone services in 1889. The Perth General Post Office was relocated to St Georges Terrace between 1887 and 1890, however by 1910 this accommodation was inadequate for the services provided. In 1900 there were 175 post offices across Western Australia, together with 160 telephone exchanges. The Commonwealth took over control of postal and <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> at Federation in 1901.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Hengchun {{earthquakes}} {{occurred on}} December 26 at 20:26 and 20:34 local time off the southwest coast of Taiwan in the Luzon Strait, which connects the South China Sea with the Philippine Sea.

25|$|In the Northwest Territories, {{transportation}} and communication can be problematic. Long winters tend {{to close the}} rivers to navigation for nearly two months. Apart from the Great Slave Railway and the Mackenzie highway system, that links to Alberta and to the Great Slave Lake area, commerce, supply, and travel remain largely airborne. The region includes scores of airfields. An ongoing northern roads program, launched since 1966, is opening up the area. Moreover, the Liard Highway, opened in 1984, connects Fort Simpson to the Alaska Highway. Other highways link Inuvik to the Yukon and Hay River then Yellowknife to the highways in Alberta. In winter, some frozen rivers and lakes are used for road traffic. These are also vast <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 29 April OCHA {{reported}} that airstrikes hit SIA on 28 April, damaging the runway and hampering aid deliveries. Airstrikes were also reported at Al Hudayda Airport and Saada. Widespread internet and phone disruptions {{were reported in}} several governorates {{due to the lack}} of fuel and electricity. On 25 April, the Yemen Public Telecommunications Corporation warned that unless the fuel crisis was resolved, <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> (mobile phones, internet, and land lines) would shut down within a week. The disruption in communication was affecting information flow on humanitarian needs and operations. On 29 April, Haradh was heavily bombarded, including areas near the main hospital. Food distribution and aid would reportedly stop within a week if additional fuel could not be obtained. As of 29 April the Al Hudaydah Governorate ran out of fuel and aid operations could not be completed.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the {{government}} set up TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) which reduced the interference of Government in deciding tariffs and policy making. The political powers changed in 1999 {{and the new}} government {{under the leadership of}} Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more pro-reforms and introduced better liberalisation policies. In 2000, the Vajpayee government constituted the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) through an amendment of the TRAI Act, 1997. The primary objective of TDSAT's establishment was to release TRAI from adjudicatory and dispute settlement functions in order to strengthen the regulatory framework. Any dispute involving parties like licensor, licensee, service provider and consumers are resolved by TDSAT. Moreover, any direction, order or decision of TRAI can be challenged by appealing in TDSAT. The government corporatised the operations wing of DoT on 1 October 2000 and named it as Department of <b>Telecommunication</b> <b>Services</b> (DTS) which was later named as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The proposal of raising the stake of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by the opposite political parties and leftist thinkers. Domestic business groups wanted {{the government}} to privatise VSNL. Finally in April 2002, the government decided to cut its stake of 53% to 26% in VSNL and to throw it open for sale to private enterprises. TATA finally took 25% stake in VSNL.|$|E
