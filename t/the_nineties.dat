5|$|In Bangladesh, {{scores in}} <b>the</b> <b>nineties</b> against both the President's XI and Bangladesh A were {{followed}} by a century in the first Test, and 60 in the second. He scored one half century in the three ODIs, although England only used five batsman in the comfortable victories. England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted {{to take control of}} the match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get something from the series, but was also criticised for his poor catching.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of <b>the</b> <b>nineties.</b> In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost a quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not been {{recorded}} since the original pair of Negros fruit doves were shot in May 1953 at Mt Kanlaon. However, a local hunter in southern Negros claimed to have shot it in <b>the</b> <b>nineties,</b> which has given hope that the species may still exist, and as such the IUCN lists the Negros fruit dove as Critically Endangered, as any surviving population is likely to number fewer than 50 birds. If the species still exists, {{it is likely that}} habitat destruction for agriculture, timber, and charcoal-burning and hunting, a common problem for all other pigeons on Negros, are major threats.|$|E
5|$|Astle {{made his}} ODI debut against the West Indies at Eden Park, Auckland in January 1995. His first century came {{the same year}} against India at the Vidharba Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur. Opening the batting, Astle made 114 runs from 128 balls in a match which New Zealand won. He {{followed}} that with another century in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, against England. Astle's match-winning innings of 119 against Pakistan finds a mention in the 100 best ODI innings of all-time by Wisden in 2002. He scored his second century in World Cup, this time against Zimbabwe in the 2003 tournament. His highest ODI total of 145 not out was achieved against the United States during the 2004 Champions Trophy. In ODIs Astle was most successful against India making five centuries. Astle ended up in <b>the</b> <b>nineties</b> on nine occasions, including twice where he remained not out.|$|E

His highest score of 239his only double centurywas made against Pakistan in 2007 at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. He made centuries against all the Test-cricket playing nations except South Africa and the West Indies. His centuries have been scored in {{fourteen}} cricket grounds, including eight outside India. He ended up in <b>the</b> <b>nineties</b> on four occasions, including two scores of 99.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} specimen {{was shot}} {{along with a}} bird suspected to be its mate from a fruiting tree. Nothing else is known about its behavior. The species has not been definitively reported since its original discovery in 1953, and as several searches of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding forests have not discovered any sign of the bird, many believe {{that it may be}} extinct. However, a local hunter from southern Negros claimed to have shot it <b>the</b> <b>nineties,</b> and the discovery of many species formerly thought endemic to Negros on the nearby island of Panay have given some hope that the species may persist. As such, it is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and hunting.|$|E
5|$|Villa {{were one}} of the {{founding}} members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season. For the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Nineties</b> however Villa went through three different managers and their league positions were inconsistent, although they did win two League Cups and regularly achieved UEFA Cup qualification. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost 1–0 to Chelsea in the last game to be played at the old Wembley Stadium. Again Villa's league position continued to fluctuate under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when David O'Leary left in acrimony. After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Doug Ellis finally decided to sell his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health. After much speculation it was announced the club was to be bought by American businessman Randy Lerner, owner of NFL franchise the Cleveland Browns.|$|E

5|$|Fewer than 95 deluxe {{editions of}} Agrippa are extant, {{although}} {{the exact number}} is unknown and {{is the source of}} considerable mystery. The Victoria and Albert Museum possesses a deluxe edition, numbered 4 of 10. A publicly accessible copy of the deluxe edition is available at the Rare Books Division of the New York Public Library and a small copy resides at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, while the Frances Mulhall Achilles Library at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City hosts a promotional prospectus. The Victoria and Albert Museum's copy was first exhibited in a display entitled The Book and Beyond, held in the Museum's 20th Century Gallery from April to October 1995. The same copy was subsequently also included in a V display entitled Digital Pioneers, from 2009–2010. Another copy of the book was exhibited in the 2003–2004 exhibition Ninety from <b>the</b> <b>Nineties</b> at the New York Public Library. Gibson at one point claimed never to have seen a copy of the printed book, spurring speculation that no copies had actually been made. Many copies have since been documented, and Gibson's signature was noted on the copy held by the New York Public Library. In 2011, the Bodleian Library's Special Collections Department at the University of Oxford acquired Kevin Begos' copy of Agrippa, as well as the archive of Begos' papers related to the work.|$|E
