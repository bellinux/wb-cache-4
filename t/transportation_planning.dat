5|$|In <b>transportation</b> <b>planning,</b> the {{different}} sources and destinations of foot and vehicle traffic that meet and interact at {{a traffic light}} can be modeled mathematically as the vertices of a graph, with edges connecting different source-destination pairs.

40|$|A <b>transportation</b> <b>plan</b> is a {{byproduct}} from {{the calculation of}} the Kantorovich distance between two images. It describes a transformation {{from one of the}} images to the other. This master thesis shows how <b>transportation</b> <b>plans</b> can be used for video coding and how to process the <b>transportation</b> <b>plans</b> to achieve a good bitrate/quality ratio. Various parameters are evaluated using an implemented <b>transportation</b> <b>plan</b> video coder. The introduction of transform coding with DCT proves to be very useful, as it reduces the size of the resulting <b>transportation</b> <b>plans.</b> DCT coding roughly gives a 10 -fold decrease in bitrate with maintained quality compared to the nontransformed <b>transportation</b> <b>plan</b> coding. With the best settings for <b>transportation</b> <b>plan</b> coding, I was able to code a test sequence at about 5 times the bitrate for MPEG coding of the same sequence with similar quality. As video coding using <b>transportation</b> <b>plans</b> is a very new concept, the thesis is ended with conclusions on the test results and suggestions for future research in this area...|$|R

Since then, it has grown from a single train line to seven, and expanded to include complementing bus service.

With the New York City Department of <b>Transportation</b> <b>planning</b> a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E

5|$|A {{newcomer}} to the Carter administration and to national politics, Goldschmidt traded not only on his experience in <b>transportation</b> <b>planning,</b> but on his political acumen as well; following Carter's unsuccessful bid for re-election, Goldschmidt expressed doubts about the Democratic Party's future if it couldn't learn to cultivate political allies more effectively. Goldschmidt's time in Washington, DC, informed his own understanding of politics, as well. He remained in office through {{the remainder of the}} Carter administration. In late 1979, Republican presidential hopeful John B. Anderson called for Goldschmidt's resignation, and members of the United States Senate Banking Committee later chastised him, for having suggested that he would withhold transportation funds from municipalities, such as Chicago and Philadelphia, whose mayors supported Ted Kennedy in his primary election bid against Carter. Goldschmidt resigned at the conclusion of Carter's term on January 20, 1981.|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{experienced}} a post-war economic and population boom after World War II. Oscar Mayer, Ralston Purina, {{and other companies}} all built plants in west Davenport. 1956 brought the Interstate highway network to Davenport. Local <b>transportation</b> <b>planning</b> took on a new design after World War II. Paved state and federal highways built to and through Davenport in the 1930s were expanded to handle new truck shipping patterns. In 1960 a second span was constructed {{to help with the}} increased traffic on the Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge, while the first segment of Interstate 80, between Iowa Highway 38 and U.S. Highway 61, opened later that year. A segment connecting U.S. 61 to U.S. 67 was completed in 1964, while other Interstate highways – 74 on the east and 280 on the west – also opened to traffic during the 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery County, Maryland, {{similarly}} approved {{plans to}} install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and high-traffic destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion {{will be paid}} for by a $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region <b>Transportation</b> <b>Planning</b> Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters of stations in the county could be too far from each other as well as the larger network of stations within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county has too few bike lanes and trails to support the expected number of users. Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013.|$|E

5|$|Lynn is {{intended}} to be the terminus of a future extension of the MBTA Blue Line, which would bring the line 4.5 additional miles from Wonderland in Revere to Lynn. This extension has been proposed in various forms for over 80 years. The 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945–47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn right-of-way. Ever since the 1954 Revere extension was cut short to Wonderland, a further extension to Lynn has been planned. Following on the 1926 and 1945-47 studies, the 1966 Program for Mass Transportation recommended that the Blue Line be extended to Lynn, while the 1969 Recommended Highway and Transit Plan proposed that the extension run as far as Salem. An extension was not present in the 1972 Final Report of the Boston <b>Transportation</b> <b>Planning</b> Review, but the 1974 Transportation Plan revived the project with possible termini of Lynn, Salem, or even Route 128 in Peabody. The 1978 Program for Mass Transportation report and 1983 Transportation Plan both continued support for an extension to Lynn. Despite the continued recommendations, however, other projects like extensions of the Red and Orange lines were given funding instead of the Blue Line.|$|E
