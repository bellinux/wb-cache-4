50|$|At the nanoscale, {{owing to}} the reduced size of the {{specimen}} and the forces and displacements to be measured, uniaxial testing or any mechanical testing for that matter, are challenging. As a result, most tests are carried in configurations other than uniaxial-tensile, using available nanoscale science tools like the atomic force microscope (AFM) to perform a <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test,</b> SEM and TEM to perform bending resonance tests and nanoindenters to perform compression tests. In recent years, {{it has been found}} that results are not completely unambiguous. This was exemplified by the fact that different researchers obtained different values of the same property for the same material. This spurred the development of MEMS with the capability of carrying out tensile tests on individual nanoscale elements.|$|E
30|$|Flexural {{strength}} and {{modulus of elasticity}} {{are the two most}} important mechanical characteristics in the evaluation of the fiber reinforcement systems [1]. The <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> is a simple method used for comparison of the load bearing capacity of different unidirectional FRC beams [21]. The flexural strength, which is measured in the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test,</b> determines the behavior of the material under simultaneous tensile and compressive loading [1, 2].|$|E
30|$|The {{test method}} {{that is most}} similar to the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> is the nanoindentation method, which is also based on AFM [48, 49]. Generally, the nanoindentation method is widely used for {{measuring}} the mechanical properties of thin film-like nanomaterials. By applying the AFM tip to the thin-film nanomaterials, their hardness and elastic modulus can be measured. The nanoindentation method {{can also be used}} to measure the elastic modulus of nanomaterials with high aspect ratio. The indentation method for nanomaterials with high aspect ratio is similar to the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> described above. The greatest difference between the two is that in the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test,</b> the mechanical properties are measured by the tips of the nanomaterial at the edges of the trench, whereas in the nanoindentation method, the mechanical properties are evaluated with the nanomaterial laid on top of a flat substrate. In some studies, both the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> and the nanoindentation test were applied to identical nanomaterials so as to measure the elastic modulus, with the results of both tests then compared [39, 40].|$|E
30|$|Our {{results on}} {{interfacial}} friction and shear strength could have direct implication on the AFM <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> that {{are widely used}} in extracting mechanical properties of one-dimensional nanostructures including CNTs and NWs [37, 38]. Often the adhesion between the NWs and the substrate {{is assumed to be}} strong enough to provide a fixed–fixed boundary condition for the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> The assumption is valid for NWs with small diameters; but for those with large diameters, it could lead to large data scatter as typically observed in experiments. Our results could be incorporated into data reduction in the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> experiments to quantify the influence of adhesion and friction on the measured mechanical properties. Other methods that could also be used to eliminate the ambiguity caused by the NW–substrate friction in the <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> include EBID of platinum or carbon to reinforce the clamps [39].|$|R
30|$|The <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> {{performed}} on selected casts (Fig.  8) revealed no major difference in material strength between the 16 -ply trials and the 30 -ply trials. Callahan et al. [15, 16] recommended <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> and diametric compression tests to best characterize the material strength of casts. In the present study, we performed <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> From our data, {{it appears the}} composite material is no stronger than {{an equal number of}} plies of plaster. The clinical importance of these data is unclear, because the materials were not tested in the form of intact, cylindrical casts nor were they tested for scuff resistance or torsional stability.|$|R

The {{fracture}} {{behavior and}} adhesion strength of CrN/Cr and CrN films on SKD 61 substrates were investigated by a <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b> The SKD 61 substrates were {{coated with a}} film with multilayer of CrN/Cr and a single film of CrN by a physical vapor deposition (PVD). The fracture behaviors of CrN/Cr and CrN films at <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adhesions of the CrN/Cr/SKD 61 and the CrN/SKD 61 were also evaluated using a scratch tester. The scratch test resulted in no great difference in the adhesion strength between the CrN/Cr/SKD 61 and the CrN/SKD 61.

40|$|In recent years, {{advances}} in material testing equipment caused {{the determination of}} mechanical properties by means of <b>three-point</b> <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> to lose ground in detriment to more accurate tensile tests.

Another method of directly determining Gc is also dealt with. A <b>three-point</b> <b>bend</b> <b>test</b> on a notched beam gives a stable load-deflection curve. The area under the curve represents the amount of energy consumed when the crack propagates through the beam. When the cross-sectional area is known, Gc can be calculated.
