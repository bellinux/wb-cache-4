5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) {{were found to}} not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). <b>The</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted {{in a period of}} major scientific advancements.|$|E
5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E

The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the breasts were emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to walk around with their breasts exposed. Some women took the “fashionable maternity” a step further and wore a “six-month pad” under their dress to appear pregnant.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> {{question}} previously held truths {{and search}} for new answers resulted {{in a period of}} major scientific advancements, now known as the Scientific Revolution. The Scientific Revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543, when the books De humani corporis fabrica (On the Workings of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius, and also De Revolutionibus, by the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, were first printed. The thesis of Copernicus' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun. The period culminated with the publication of the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 by Isaac Newton, representative of the unprecedented growth of scientific publications throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the notion}} of Satya, or Truth, {{is central to the}} Gandhian {{conception}} of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.|$|E

Failure to make an application every year results in being placed {{at the back of the}} queue.

40|$|This paper assesses households’ {{awareness}} {{of the causes of}} drainage basin degradation and measures their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved drainage basin management. Cross-sectional data were collected from 398 randomly-selected households. The spike and bivariate probit models were applied <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> mean <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay and factors affecting households’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay, respectively. Agricultural expansion, population pressure, changes in weather conditions and climate change were identified as the main causes of degradation of the Dechatu drainage basin in Dire Dawa Administration, Ethiopia. The study also identified appropriate mechanisms and bases of charging a drainage basin management fee from the sampled respondents. <b>The</b> mean <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay from <b>the</b> spike model was computed to be ETB 111 per annum for five years whereas <b>the</b> mean <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay from <b>the</b> open-ended elicitation method was computed to be ETB 78 per year. <b>The</b> higher mean <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay from <b>the</b> spike model might be due to anchoring effect from the dichotomous choice format.

25|$|In psychology, {{capitalization}} {{refers to}} the process of drawing additional benefits (e.g., increases in good mood) from a positive event by sharing it with other people. Research shows that individuals who share news of a positive event (such as, for example, acceptance to graduate school or a promotion at work) with a close other and receive a supportive response from that person, show increases in positive emotions and personal well-being above and beyond the boost given by the positive event itself. Furthermore, support for positive event sharing has positive implications for relationship well-being. Specifically, receipt of such support increases feelings of trust and the endorsement of a more prosocial orientation (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> respond positively in an unpleasant or conflict situation involving one's relationship partner). Additionally, support for positive event sharing is more strongly linked to higher levels of relationship quality and lower likelihood of break-ups in the future than support extended during discussion of negative events.|$|E
25|$|Sunnis {{believe that}} {{although}} Muhammad did not appoint a successor, Abu Bakr was elected the first caliph by the Muslim community and they recognize {{the first four}} caliphs as Muhammad's successors. Shias believe that Muhammad named his successor, Ali, at Ghadir Khumm; Muslim leadership belonged to the person determined by divine order. The two groups also disagree on Ali's attitude towards Abu Bakr and the two caliphs who succeeded him: Umar and Uthman ibn Affan. Sunnis and the Zaydis emphasize Ali's acceptance and support of their rule; according to the Twelver Shia, he distanced himself from them and was prevented from fulfilling the religious duty that Muhammad had given him. They maintain that if Ali was the rightful successor (as ordained by God), {{it would have been}} his duty as leader of the Muslim nation to make war with Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman; however, he had neither the military strength nor <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> wage civil war amongst the Muslims. Ali believed that he could fulfil his imamate without fighting.|$|E
25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> do this kind of trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one to confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E
