2500|$|When President Jimmy Carter in 1979 {{broke off}} {{relations}} with the ROC {{in order to establish}} {{relations with the}} PRC, Congress responded by passing the Taiwan Relations Act that maintained relations, but stopped short of full recognition of the ROC. In 1982 President Ronald Reagan also saw that the Six Assurances were adopted, the fifth being that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, United States policy has remained ambiguous. In the House International Relations Committee on April 21, 2004, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, James A. Kelly, was asked by Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) whether America's commitment to Taiwan's democracy conflicted with the so-called One-China Policy. He admitted the difficulty of defining the U.S.'s position: [...] "I didn’t really define it, and I’m not sure I very easily could define it." [...] He added, [...] "I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not. It is not the One-China principle that Beijing suggests." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thank'ee,' replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious manner. 'But I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what.</b> <b>It</b> {{might have}} been twenty {{thousand}} pound.' ...|$|R
