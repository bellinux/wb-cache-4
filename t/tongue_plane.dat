50|$|Clearing certain game conditions, such as {{reaching}} {{a certain level}} or scoring {{a certain amount of}} microgames in certain categories, unlocks additional bonus games. These include special towers with certain play conditions, such as the player having only one life, to various minigames, including two-player games that are controlled using the shoulder buttons. Minigames include Pyoro, in which players must grab falling fruit using an elongated <b>tongue,</b> Paper <b>Plane,</b> where players guide a paper airplane down safely, and Dr. Wario, a Wario-themed version of Dr. Mario.|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{different}} types of nonlinear resonances in a weakly damped Duffing oscillator using bifurcation theory techniques. In addition to (i) odd subharmonic resonances found on the primary branch of symmetric periodic solutions with the forcing frequency and (ii) even subharmonic resonances due to symmetry-broken periodic solutions that bifurcate off the primary branch and also oscillate at the forcing frequency, we uncover (iii) novel resonance type due to isolas of periodic solutions that are not connected to the primary branch. These occur between odd and even resonances, oscillate {{at a fraction of}} the forcing frequency, and give rise to a complicated resonance `curve' with disconnected elements and high degree of multistability. We use bifurcation continuation to compute resonance <b>tongues</b> in the <b>plane</b> of the forcing frequency vs. the forcing amplitude for different but fixed values of the damping rate. In this way, we demonstrate that identified here isolated resonances explain the intriguing structure of "patchy tongues" observed for week damping and link it to a seemingly unrelated phenomenon of "bifurcation superstructure" described for moderate damping...|$|R
5000|$|Yaksha - Due to a spell cast on Mystique Sonia, {{anyone who}} {{declares}} {{their love for}} her three times turns into a Yaksha. Yaksha is a purple and pink creature which rests upon Mystique Sonia's head like a hat. It is also an extremely flexible and stretchable being shown to turn into various forms to aid Mystique Sonia like an accessory, a dress, and a trampoline. It can even extend its arms to propel Mystique Sonia forward. By putting Yaksha's eyes over her own eyes, Mystique Sonia can see heat and the body heat given of by animals. Curiously, this ability works on chameleons {{despite the fact that}} they do not give off heat. Yaksha can also put his arms out like plane wings and if Mystique Sonia does her tongue attack from a short radius as if her <b>tongue</b> were a <b>planes</b> propeller, Mystique Sonia can fly. When Mystique Sonia gets mad at Yaksha for his jealousy as seen in [...] "Scorpion Castle" [...] and [...] "Sheep Castle", he will usually rest on Mighty Ray's head. When Mystique Sonia is not mad at Yaksha, he usually gives her a rose. It is unknown who was the first to fall for Sonia, but in [...] "Liger Castle", he was killed in action as a Yaksha. It was soon replaced by a new Yaksha who was once a Tank Army member and a devoted member of Mystique Sonia's fan club. In [...] "Scorpion Castle", when Yaksha ate 100 buns he transformed into a robot-like Yaksha with Lin Chung for the head, Sonia and Jumpy for the hands, and Mighty Ray and Mr. No Hands for the legs. In the Chinese dub, references of Yaksha and Mystique Sonia's relationship were never mentioned and his voice is completely different from the North American dub.|$|R
