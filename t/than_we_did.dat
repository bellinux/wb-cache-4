25|$|The {{album was}} re-released as a 2-disc 'Deluxe Edition' on 22 October 2012. The second disc {{includes}} the album re-recorded, with each song {{performed in a}} different style, including acoustic performances. It was recorded at Regal House Studio in Cambridgeshire, and produced by Lee Batiuk, with Chris Pennells and Lee Wilson involved in the recording process unlike the original release, after the band were inspired to experiment with their sound by performing at St Pancras International railway station {{as part of the}} Station Sessions. This was the same studio where the drums were recorded for the original release. Speaking about the Station Sessions performance, which was an acoustic 'stripped down' performance, James Veck-Gilodi explained; 'we thought we sounded better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> as a rock band' and noted that 'it's nice to make music that sounds more like the music I listen to'. The release will feature banjo, mandolin and piano.|$|E

[...] According to Stoller, the duo was [...] "surprised at the kind of knowledge that he had about black music. We figured that he had these remarkable pipes and all that, but we didn't realize that he knew {{so much about the}} blues. We were quite surprised to find out that he knew as much about it as we did. He certainly knew a lot more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> about country music and gospel music." [...] Leiber remembered the recording process with Presley, [...] "He was fast. Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes." [...] As Stoller recalled, Presley [...] "was 'protected'" [...] by his manager and entourage. [...] "He was removed. ... They kept him separate." ...|$|E

The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades, so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long-term strategy. We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...|$|E

[...] That is true; I stick to that. I will stand by Judge Douglas in {{that to the}} bitter end. And now, Judge Douglas, come and stand by me, and truthfully show how they acted, understanding it better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> All I ask of you, Judge Douglas, is {{to stick to the}} proposition that the men of the Revolution understood this subject better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> now, and with that better understanding they acted better than you are trying to act now.|$|R
500|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 {{called for}} the {{disarmament}} of militia with the Taif agreement {{at the end of}} the Lebanese civil war. Hezbollah denounced, and protested against, the resolution. The 2006 military conflict with Israel has increased the controversy. Failure to disarm remains a violation of the resolution and agreement as well as subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Since then both Israel and Hezbollah have asserted that the organization has gained in military strength. A Lebanese public opinion poll taken in August 2006 shows that most of the Shia did not believe that Hezbollah should disarm after the 2006 Lebanon war, while the majority of Sunni, Druze and Christians believed that they should. The Lebanese cabinet, under president Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, guidelines state that Hezbollah enjoys the right to [...] "liberate occupied lands." [...] In 2009, a Hezbollah commander (speaking on condition of anonymity) said, [...] "e have far more rockets and missiles [...] <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in 2006." ...|$|E
500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|During the war, McKinley also {{pursued the}} {{annexation}} of the Republic of Hawaii. The new republic, dominated by business interests, had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself. There was strong American support for annexation, {{and the need}} for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila. McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover. Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress. The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, [...] "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing... a firmness in pursuing it"; the President told Cortelyou, [...] "We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> California. It is manifest destiny." ...|$|E

500|$|Anthem Visual Effects {{resumed their}} duties of {{producing}} the visual effects {{for the second}} season. The company's Lee Wilson noted that their workload for the second season [...] "increased exponentially" [...] over the first, with some episodes containing as many as 500 visual effects shots. The produce decided to [...] "re-jig" [...] the opening title sequence, which {{they wanted to do}} each year. The photograph where Magnus meets Albert Einstein changed to aviation pilot Amelia Earhart. The producers noticed that the visual effects have been made [...] "more wonderous <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the season before," [...] as they were able to produce certain actions that they never tried before. The steno in [...] "Eulogy" [...] was designed to look adorable, harmless and bunny-like in its infancy, but more menacing when it grows up. In making the Adjuster fly in [...] "Hero", both visual and practical effects were used; some of the simpler sequences involved Gauthier hooked up to a velocity rig, but in order to make him fly over the city skyline, a computer-generated avatar was created. The design of the coleanthropus in the same episode was based on a mix of insect and dinosaur.|$|E
500|$|In {{early summer}} 1981, while Raiders of the Lost Ark was being promoted, Columbia Pictures met with Speilberg {{to discuss the}} script, after having to develop Night Skies with the {{director}} as the intended sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. However, the head of Columbia Pictures' marketing and research development, Marvin Atonowsky, concluded {{that it had a}} limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young kids. The President of Columbia's worldwide productions, John Veitch, also felt that the script wasn't good or scary enough to draw enough crowd. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia Pictures CEO Frank Price passed on the project, calling it [...] "a wimpy Walt Disney movie" [...] and thus putting it in a turnaround, so Spielberg approached the more receptive Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, the then-parent company of Universal Studios. Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1 million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film's net profits. Veitch later recalled that [...] "I think [...] we made more on that picture <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> on any of our films." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the M2B's lack {{of success}} Herd said of the team, [...] "Everyone was ten times more {{determined}} to do better the following year." [...] On {{the design of the}} car he reflected that, [...] "our emphasis tended to be more on the elegance of the chassis structure rather than on the design of a really quick racing car" [...] and that, [...] "we ... tended to go towards technical ingenuity and bullshit rather than racewinning engineering". Team member and later manager of the organisation Teddy Mayer said, [...] "Our main problems were with the choice of the Ford engine." [...] Bruce McLaren's personal secretary and author Eoin Young concurs. The winners of the 1966 drivers' and constructors' championships, Jack Brabham and his eponymous team, used a Repco-modified and badged Oldsmobile engine. It produced approximately 290bhp â€“ less than the Ford â€“ but its light weight and reliability rendered it effective. Despite having used the Oldsmobile in sports racing cars, the McLaren team discounted it. Afterwards, Mayer said, [...] "We considered it, but the kind of modifications which Repco did were well beyond our resources, and I doubt very much if we could have done any more with it <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> with the Indy Ford." ...|$|E

500|$|Priestley {{seems to}} have yearned for a more {{cosmopolitan}} community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was [...] "seemingly almost out of the world" [...] and complaining {{that he had to}} wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794â€“95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from my original views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners." ...|$|E

Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the year before. We should be doing more on public lands, and that's the outer continental shelf and what's going on in Alaska and so on."

2500|$|For example, when President William McKinley {{advocated}} {{annexation of}} the Republic of Hawaii in 1898, {{he said that}} [...] "We need Hawaii as much {{and a good deal}} more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> California. It is manifest destiny." [...] On the other hand, former President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat who had blocked the annexation of Hawaii during his administration, wrote that McKinley's annexation of the territory was a [...] "perversion of our national destiny". Historians continued that debate; some have interpreted American acquisition of other Pacific island groups in the 1890s as an extension of manifest destiny across the Pacific Ocean. Others have regarded it as the antithesis of manifest destiny and merely imperialism.|$|E
2500|$|Then on 16, 17 and 18 August, Yorkshire, captained by Close, played Warwickshire at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Warwickshire {{had been}} set 142 to win in 100 minutes. When the match ended, Warwickshire were 133 for 5, nine runs short of victory, and the match was drawn. However, Yorkshire managed to bowl only 24 overs, with only two being bowled in the last 15 minutes. Whilst it was wet, and Yorkshire had to dry the ball often, this was seen as {{unacceptable}} time-wasting and gamesmanship. Close did not help himself as he personally berated a Warwickshire spectator who he thought had called out something inopportune, though in the event he picked on the wrong man. After the game, Close said to the Warwickshire captain, M.J.K. Smith, [...] "Bad luck, Mike, you played better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> But I couldn't give you the game."
