Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E

3000|$|<b>To</b> study <b>the</b> {{influence}} of pH on the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 WO 6 /Ag 2 S heterostructure, {{a series of}} photocatalytic experiments were carried out under different pH values. In this process, aqueous Rh B solution was adjusted to different initial pH values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) using diluted nitrate acid or sodium hydroxide, while keeping other conditions constant. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous reports, the {{influence of}} pH mainly takes effect in two aspects. On the one hand, the pH of the solution will influence the adsorption of dye molecules via changing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> charges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalysts [51]. The variation in the adsorption of dye molecules will inevitably influence the photocatalytic efficiencies because the photocatalytic process mainly takes place on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalysts. It {{has been reported that}} the adsorption of organic pollutants on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalyst is a prerequisite for efficient photocatalytic degradation because the photocatalytic reaction usually takes place on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalyst. Usually, strong adsorption benefits the photocatalytic degradation [52, 53]. On the other hand, the pH of the solution also exerts tremendous influence on the molecular structure of dyes, which will determine the attaching modes of Rh B molecules <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalysts [54]. <b>To</b> be specific, <b>the</b> Rh B molecules can attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalysts by the carboxylic group or the amino group, and the attaching modes are greatly influenced by the pH of the solution. If Rh B molecules attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalysts with the amino group, the photosensitization process will be unfavored. [...] Rh B molecules attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photocatalysts via the amino group, the photosentization process will be favored, which could be judged by the blue shifts of absorption peaks during the photocatalytic process. So, the influence of pH during the photocatalytic process will be the synergistic effects of the two effects mention above. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experimental result, both the photodegradation efficiency and the photodegradation rate of Rh B show monotonous decrease when the pH of the solution increases from 2 to 8 (Fig.  7 a, b).

40|$|The {{densities of}} {{positively}} charged, colloidal iron hydroxide particles binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> glutaraldehyde-fixed cultured Ehrlich ascites tumour cells, were determined on cells main-tained in suspension and monolayer cultures.

Prior treatment of the cells with ribonuclease did not significantly alter the proportions of particles binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2 different <b>surface</b> regions, indicating that the ribonuclease-susceptible binding sites are distributed with similar mean densities over the microvilli and the regions between them. Prior treatment of the cells with neuraminidase reduced the densities of particles binding to microvilli <b>to</b> those of <b>the</b> intermicrovillous spaces, indicating that the original higher density over the microvilli is due to an increased number of sialic acid residues at their <b>surfaces.</b> <b>The</b> findings are discussed in relationship to observed changes in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> density <b>of</b> microvilli when these cells convert from suspension to monolayer cultures...|$|R
