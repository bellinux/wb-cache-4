40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for ranking {{alternatives}} in multicriteria decision-making problems {{when there is}} imprecision concerning the alternative performances, component utility functions and weights. We assume decision maker?s preferences are represented by an additive multiattribute utility function, in which weights can be modeled by independent normal variables, fuzzy numbers, value intervals or by an ordinal relation. <b>The</b> <b>approaches</b> are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> dominance measures or exploring the weight space in order to describe which ratings would make each alternative the preferred one. On the one hand, <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> dominance measures compute the minimum utility difference among pairs of alternatives.

However, expertise of an individual who responds to an expert may be more important than one who responds to a normal or beginner user.

50|$|Modeling {{sources from}} the field {{distribution}} results in models of brain activation that may substantially differ from the observations of clinical correlations between the abnormal waveform and the lesion site. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> clinical correlations supports {{the idea of a}} single generator for each SEP component, which is suitable for responses reflecting the sequential activation fibers and synaptic relays of the somatosensory pathways.

Around 1860, psychology was finding its scientific foundation mainly in Germany, with the rigorous research of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894), who had trained as a physicist, and of Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920). They focused their work mainly in the area of sensory psychophysiology, because it was the most rewarding for <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the paradigms of experimental physics.

50|$|Since {{early this}} century, the {{technology}} has been available to allow a company to reliably achieve next-best-action capabilities in high volumes {{as well as in}} real-time. Typically, this requires a multi-channel, centralized decisioning authority that dispenses all decisions with regard to the customer (see Enterprise decision management). This “decisioning hub” leverages “decision logic” that combines the company’s business rules with predictive and adaptive (aka self-learning) decisioning models to help determine how to approach a customer prior to as well as during an interaction. The decisioning authority takes into account each customer’s expectations, propensities and likely behavior through the use of predictive modeling. Interfaces that can leverage this intelligence must also be in place to externalize the logic and guide an agent (or the system itself) in how the customer would prefer to be treated at any given moment, continuously recalibrating <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> customer responses.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the study}} of {{randomness}} concepts and their applications in computational complexity theory. In Chapter 3, we discuss the classical notions of randomness. We give a systematic study of various notions of randomness, especially, of the following concepts defined in terms of typicalness: Martin-Lof randomness, rec-randomness, Schnorr randomness, Ko randomness, and Kurtz randomness. We study each notion of typicalness by using three different approaches: <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> constructive null covers, <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> martingales and <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Solovay style criteria (the first Borel-Cantelli lemma-like condition). Schnorr has shown that Martin-Lof randomness is a proper refinement of rec-randomness, and he left open the question whether rec-randomness is a proper refinement of Schnorr randomness.
