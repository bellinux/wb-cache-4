40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the foreseen phenomenal growth of mobilesat services will impact positively existing terrestrial mobile radio services. Mobilesat systems will not displace the existing terrestrial market in the near future, {{partly due to the}} high cost of their terminal units and associated airtime, but also due to some technical limitations, such as lack of spectrum efficiency and high susceptibility to shadowing. However, the ubiquity of mobilesat services will open new market to terrestrial radio technologies. The latter {{is expected to be the}} most economical way of extending locally mobilesat services to many users. Conversely, mobilesat systems will be used to extend the capabilities of terrestrial radio systems in areas where the former cannot be implemented cost effectively. It is believed that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> operators using these service extension capabilities will have a competitive advantage over those who do not. Overall, it is expected that emerging mobilesat services, far from being a threat to terrestrial radio systems, will rather provide these with numerous opportunities of incrementing their base market...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances and standardization {{has led to the}} large scale adoption of personal mobile communications. Within years global personal communications will be provided by non-geostationary satellites. These satellite systems will complement the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> coverage to provide one complete global network. Mobility management is a key issue in any personal communications network. Furthermore, the seamless integration between satellite and terrestrial systems will {{play a major role in}} the adoption of satellite personal communications. This thesis focuses on the optimization of mobility management procedures in an integrated satellite and GSM personal communication network. The coverage and mobile channel properties of first generation non-geostationary constellation proposals are analyzed (these being Globalstar, ICO and Iridium). A new LEO satellite constellation is proposed that has a similar number of satellites as Globalstar and Iridium but provides superior levels of satellite visibility over its service area. In order to overcome the problem of location area definition in a non-geostationary satellite constellation, two techniques are presented. Subsequently, the paging and location update signalling loads for each scheme are evaluated and optimized particularly in the urban and highway environments. These results are combined to arrive at the optimum location area size for each method of location area definition. A further problem caused by the motion of satellites is defining the service area of a gateway earth station. A previously proposed scheme is presented and its restrictions and implications discussed. Subsequently, a new scheme is proposed based on the highest satellite connectivity. This scheme is then combined with the optimized location area definition identified previously. Finally, issues associated with the integration of the two optimized schemes with the GSM system are presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the packet-scheduling function within the access scheme of a unidirectional satellite system providing point-to-multipoint services to mobile users. The satellite {{system may be}} regarded as an overlay multicast/broadcast layer complementing the point-to-point third generation (3 G) <b>mobile</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>networks.</b> The satellite access scheme features maximum commonalties with the frequency division duplex (FDD) air interface of the <b>terrestrial</b> universal <b>mobile</b> telecommunications system (T-UMTS), also known as wideband {{code division multiple access}} (WCDMA), thus enabling close integration with the <b>terrestrial</b> 3 G <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> and cost-efficient handset implementations. We draw our attention on one of the radio resource management entities relevant to this interface: the packet scheduler. The lack of channel-state information and the point-to-multipoint service offering differentiate the packet scheduler in the satellite radio interface from its counterpart in point-to-point <b>terrestrial</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>networks.</b> We formulate the scheduler tasks and describe adaptations of two well-known scheduling disciplines, the multilevel priority queuing and weighted fair queuing schemes, as candidates for the time-scheduling function. Simulation results confirm the significance of the transport format combination set (TFCS) with respect to both the resource utilization achieved by the scheduler and the performance obtained by the flows at packet-level. The performance gap of the two schemes regarding the fairness provided to competing flows can be narrowed via appropriate selection of the TFCS, whereas the achieved delay and delay variation scores are ultimately dependent on the packet-level dynamics of individual flows.

40|$|This paper shares key {{findings}} of NASA's Earth Regime Network Evolution Study (ERNESt) team resulting from its 18 -month effort {{to define a}} wholly new architecture-level paradigm for the exploitation of space by civil space and commercial sector organizations. Since the launch of Sputnik in October 1957 spaceflight missions have remained highly scripted activities from launch through disposal. The utilization of computer technology has enabled dramatic increases in mission complexity; but, the underlying premise that the diverse actions necessary to meet mission goals requires minute-by-minute scripting, defined weeks in advance of execution, {{for the life of}} the mission has remained. This archetype was appropriate for a "new frontier" but now risks overtly constraining the potential market-based opportunities for the innovation considered necessary to efficiently address the complexities associated with meeting communications and navigation requirements projected to be characteristics of the next era of space exploration: a growing number of missions in simultaneous execution, increased variance of mission types and growth in location/orbital regime diversity. The resulting ERNESt architectural cornerstone - the Space Mobile Network (SMN) - was envisioned as critical to creating an environment essential to meeting these future challenges in political, programmatic, technological and budgetary terms. The SMN incorporates technologies such as: Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical communications, as well as new operations concepts such as User Initiated Services (UIS) to provide user services analogous to today's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> user. Results developed in collaboration with NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Division and field centers are reported on.

Aiming towards the absolute exploitation of the scarce radio resources in parallel with guaranteeing the requested QoS (Quality of Service), the interaction between these layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model proves to be completely necessary {{due to the fact that}} the spectrum requirements of a connection are greately affected by the transmission/reception conditions. In this framework, initially the study focuses on the capacity of the satellite systems, introducing a CAC algorithm that takes into account the effect of the wireless propagation environment on the performance of the TCP transport protocol. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated under a set of stand-alone as well as hybrid satellite architectures that include geostationary satellites along with the innovative stratospheric platforms. At the next step, the research centers around the functionality of one of the most promising <b>terrestrial,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> of broadband communication, Mobile-WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 e), on the basis of the complexity that is imposed on the spectrum management process by the use of OFDMA as well as adaptive modulation-coding at its physical layer.

In addition, the special characteristics of the IEEE 802. 16 e uplink subnet are examined thoroughly and a new RRM algorithm for radio resource saving is presented. The effectiveness of the aforementioned algorithm is theoretically established as well as quantitatively computed via simulations, while the conditions of maximum efficiency are also theoretically determined. Furthermore, a CAC algorithm is proposed that minimizes the blocking probability by making virtue of the RRM feedback. ...|$|R

30|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a gradual {{increase}} in ship’s demand for various multimedia services such as full-duplex digital data transfers, video streaming, and even internet access. Without loss of generality, satellite communication systems may be a good candidate for realizing such multimedia services because they can reliably support high data rates as well as offer immense communication coverage. However, satellite communications can be burdensome for ship subscribers because of its remarkably high cost. At sea, where a ship rarely finds other ships referred to as neighboring ships (NSs), satellite communications may be an inevitable option for obtaining multimedia services. On the other hand, a ship can easily locate NSs near the shore. In this case, we can take advantage of ad-hoc communication between ships by using another radio frequency band such as the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>mobile</b> ad-hoc <b>network</b> or the vehicle ad-hoc network.

A large variety of schemes have been proposed {{to achieve this goal}} in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>mobile</b> cellular <b>networks.</b> Most of them focus on the notion of prioritized channel allocation algorithms. However, these schemes cannot provide the connection-level quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Due to the scarcity of resources in LEO satellite networks, a connection admission control (CAC) technique becomes important to achieve this connection-level QoS for the spotbeam handovers. In this paper, a geographical connection admission control (GCAC) algorithm is introduced, which estimates the future handover blocking performance of a new call attempt based on the user location database, in order to decrease the handover blocking. Also, for its channel allocation scheme, an adaptive dynamic channel allocation (ADCA) scheme is introduced. By simulation, it is shown that the proposed GCAC with ADCA scheme guarantees the handover blocking probability to a predefined target level of QoS. Since GCAC algorithm utilizes the user location information, performance evaluation indicates that the quality of service (QoS) is also guaranteed in the non-uniform traffic pattern...|$|R
