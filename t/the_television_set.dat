As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches off <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set</b> near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of}} the earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E

5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set</b> through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E

The episode goes on to depict the events of a stormy night in 1939 when a lightning bolt struck the tower and caused five people—a celebrity couple, a rising child star, her nanny, and a hotel bellhop—to vanish from the elevator.

25|$|According to Beckett, it was Camilleri who {{spotted the}} girls walking single file along the Bega-Tathra Road in Evan's Hill and stopped {{to offer them}} a lift. At {{approximately}} 10pm, after a brief discussion with the men the girls entered the car willingly, according to Beckett. A pink portable television set, which had earlier been taken by Camilleri and Beckett from a friend {{in lieu of a}} drug-related debt was removed from {{the back seat of the}} vehicle and discarded at the side of the road to provide room for the girls to sit. <b>The</b> <b>television</b> <b>set</b> would later become important evidence and implicate the two men in their crimes to follow.|$|E
25|$|The regular-length version {{features}} Superfly {{performing the}} song {{with a band}} in an old Western-style stone building, overgrown with creeping vines. This version features a lot of added animation and distorted images, featuring black-and-white flames and bubbles. The art style features many grainy distortions {{in the style of}} a printed comic, and many patterns based on newsprint. Much of the animation focuses of images of soccer balls, which fly out of <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set</b> in the room where the band plays, and out of the building's windows. Occasionally, the animations are only additions to the scenes, while other times the entire shots have been animated. At certain points, Ochi and her back-up band are represented as cartoons, and in others, Ochi performs the song with people in gorilla suits.|$|E

500|$|A more {{negative}} review came from EW.com's Ken Tucker, {{who called the}} animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look like state-of-the-art. Tucker also said in his review that he hoped that smart people would use the Family Guy half-hour to turn off <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set</b> and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. He also called the show [...] "The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows". Even before it aired the pilot had received some criticism from the Parents Television Council, a watchdog; the creator of this website L. Brent Bozell III wrote that he initially speculated that Family Guy would be [...] "pushing the envelope".|$|E
500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the film, {{especially}} those involving Sivaji Ganesan and Saroja Devi were parodied many times. One notable parody is the comedy track from Guru En Aalu (2009), which featured Vivek and M. S. Bhaskar, who imitate Saroja Devi and Sivaji Ganesan respectively. The parody became popular and was frequently screened on comedy channels like Adithya TV and Sirippoli. In Muthu (1995), Padmini (Subhashri) hums the song [...] "Aha Mella". In Thenali (2000), Kailash (Jayaram) watches [...] "Chittu Kuruvi" [...] on television but changes the channel after imagining that Ganesan's face morphs into that of Thenali (Kamal Haasan). In the film Siruthai (2011), Kaatu Poochi (Santhanam) watches the film's climax on television before stealing <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> Posters of the film were featured in Anant Mahadevan's The Xposé (2014). Scenes from Puthiya Paravai are featured in the film Burma (2014).|$|E

500|$|Boris and Shlomo begin {{fighting}} on stage during the play, interrupting {{the production and}} inciting an intermission. Backstage, Shlomo and Boris argue once more, with Boris mentioning Shlomo's dedication to his business pursuits over familial values. Shlomo informs Boris {{that he and his}} late wife were unable to bear children, making Boris feel sympathy for his rival. Angelica sprints backstage, bumping into Shlomo and inadvertently destroying <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> Shlomo unsuccessfully tries to console her, but eventually lets Boris take over. Tommy hands Shlomo the Chanukah story book Minka read to the babies earlier; Boris convinces Shlomo to read it to the children. In the conclusion of the story, the Maccabees rededicate the Holy Temple, and discover that there is only enough oil to light the Temple's eternal flame for one day; miraculously, it remains lit for eight. Shlomo's reciting dissolves both the babies' assertion of him as the [...] "Meanie of Chanukah" [...] and his and Boris' rivalry.|$|E
500|$|Cooney {{proposed}} that public television, {{even though it}} had a poor track record in attracting inner-city audiences, could be used {{to improve the quality of}} children's programming. [...] She suggested using the television medium's [...] "most engaging traits", including high production values, sophisticated writing, and quality film and animation, to reach the largest audience possible. [...] In the words of critic Peter Hellman, [...] "If [...] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, why not give them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?" [...] Cooney wanted to create a program that would spread values favoring education to nonviewers—including their parents and older siblings, who tended to control <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> [...] To this end, she suggested that humor directed toward adults be included, which, as Lesser reported, [...] "may turn out to be a pretty good system in forcing the young child to stretch to understand programs designed for older audiences". [...] Cooney also believed cultural references and guest appearances by celebrities would encourage parents and older siblings to watch the show together.|$|E
500|$|Mixed {{assessments}} {{came from}} Robin Pierson of The TV Critic, giving the season an overall mixed score of 59 out of 100. Though he praised the series as [...] "a {{different kind of}} animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do" [...] and found [...] "enough promise to believe the show could become really funny", he criticized the season's [...] "slightly lame collection of flashback jokes." [...] Pierson considered [...] "I Never Met the Dead Man" [...] {{to be the best}} episode of the season, and regarded [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] as the season's poorest. The ending joke of [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] (which consisted of Peter stating that [...] "Canada sucks"), caused controversy with Canadian viewers. Ken Tucker gave the series a D in Entertainment Weekly, calling the animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look [...] state-of-the-art. He also hoped that smart people would use the Family Guy half hour to turn off <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set</b> and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. The premiere of Family Guy was the Super Bowl XXXIII lead out program, achieving a total of 22.01 million viewers.|$|E

500|$|In 1951, {{while working}} for {{military}} contractor Loral Electronics, engineer Ralph H. Baer was assigned to build a television set; while doing so, Baer claims he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control, rather than only hooking {{it up to a}} remote television station. Baer did not pursue the idea, but it returned to him in August 1966 while waiting for a bus. Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor Sanders Associates, came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a US$20 [...] "game box" [...] that would plug into a television screen and play games on it. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point, the very first electronic computer games had been developed {{at the start of the}} 1950s, and by 1966 several early mainframe games had been developed for mainframe computers, which were typically only found in large academic or research institutions. In the proposal, Baer began by referring to the project using military terminology, but by the time he finished it he was referring to it as Channel LP, short for [...] "let's play". The proposed device would transmit a signal that <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set</b> could tune into as if it were a television channel, and Baer described several games that could be played on it.|$|E

Most notably, Goldsen {{was a very}} visible critic of a Congressionally mandated government study {{of the impact of}} television violence on children. [...] When the study reported no ill effects, Goldsen was able to document that the television industry had stacked the study and that its results were suspect. Goldsen explained the importance of her studying television by noting, [...] "it is still possible to turn off <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> It is not possible to turn off the television environment." ...|$|E
