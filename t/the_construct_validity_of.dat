40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the 14 -item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) in the UK veterinary profession by the application of Rasch analysis, and to assess <b>the</b> external <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> derived interval scale measurements. METHODS: Data sets were derived from two independent cross-sectional surveys of the veterinary profession (n = 8, 829 and n = 1, 796). Rasch analysis (n = 500) included response option thresholds ordering, tests of fit, differential item functioning, targeting, response dependency, and person separation index (PSI). Unidimensionality was evaluated by principal component analysis of residuals. The findings were validated across further subsamples from both data sets. <b>The</b> external <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rasch-fitting item set was evaluated by associations with other measures of psychological health or psychosocial work characteristics. RESULTS: Data for the original 14 items deviated significantly from Rasch model expectations (chi-square = 558. 2, df = 112, P = < 0. 001, PSI = 0. 918). A unidimensional 7 -item scale (Short WEMWBS, SWEMWBS) with acceptable fit to the model (chi-square = 58. 8, df = 56, P = 0. 104, PSI = 0. 832) was derived by sequential removal of the most misfitting items. <b>The</b> external <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> SWEMWBS was supported. CONCLUSIONS: SWEMWBS has robust interval-level measurement properties which support its suitability as an indicator of population mental health and well-being in this occupational group with elevated suicide risk. <br/...|$|R

50|$|There is some {{question}} about <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the n-back task. While the task has strong face validity {{and is now}} in widespread use as a measure of working memory in clinical and experimental settings, there are few studies which explore the convergent validity of the n-back task with other measures of working memory. Those studies have largely revealed weak or modest correlations between individuals' performance on the n-back task and performance on other standard, accepted assessments of working memory.|$|E
5000|$|There are a lack {{of studies}} that support <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the CD-RISC.

The CD-RISC has been associated as expected (i.e., either positively or negatively) with various constructs, such as family functioning and depressive symptoms. However, it needs to be tested in relation to a more complex theory to better establish construct validity.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} for this weak correlation between the n-back task and other working memory assessments. One proposal is that the n-back task assesses different [...] "sub-components" [...] of working memory than do other assessments.

[...] Whatever {{the cause of the}} performance differences between the n-back and other assessments of working memory, some researchers stress the need for further exploration of <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the n-back task.|$|E
