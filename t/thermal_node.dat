40|$|The SNIP {{program is}} a FORTRAN {{computer}} code that generates NASTRAN structural model thermal loads when given SINDA (or similar thermal model) temperature results. SNIP correlates thermal nodes to structural elements to interface SINDA finite difference thermal models with NASTRAN finite element structural models. Node-to-element correlation includes determining which SINDA nodes should be related to each NASTRAN element and calculating a weighing factor for temperatures associated with each element-related <b>thermal</b> <b>node.</b> SNIP provides structural model thermal loads that accurately reflect thermal model results while reducing {{the time required to}} interface thermal and structural models as compared to other methods. SNIP uses thermal model geometry to search the three-dimensional space around each structural element for the nearest thermal nodes. Thermal model geometry is the combination of standard thermal model temperature results from SINDA and structural model geometry from NASTRAN. Thermal and structural models must both be defined in the same, single Cartesian coordinate system. The thermal nodes located nearest each element are used to determine element temperature for thermal distortion and stress analysis. The program shapes the three-dimensional search region while the user controls the size. With these region specifications, the numerical coding of thermal nodes, and the structural element numbers; the code can provide for the separation of substructures during correlation. The input to SNIP contains a file of thermal model temperature results and a physical location of each <b>thermal</b> <b>node</b> in three-dimensional space, combined in a SNIP-unique format. The input also contains a standard NASTRAN input deck for a model made up of plate, shell, beam, and bar elements. SNIP supports the CTRIA, CQUAD, CBAR, and CBEAM elements of NASTRAN. The user adjusts the input parameters in the source code which control the node-to-element correlation. The program outputs NASTRAN element temperature load cards for each element and NASTRAN case control cards for each temperature load set. SNIP also outputs a list of elements that contains the numbers of the SINDA nodes related to each NASTRAN element and the weight that is given to each node in temperature calculations. SNIP is written in ANSI standard FORTRAN 77. The PC version requires a PC FORTRAN compiler and has compiled successfully using Lahey FORTRAN v. 3. 0. A core memory of 300 k is recommended. The program was developed in 1987...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the Southampton Thermal Analogue (STAG) compact {{model for}} {{partially}} depleted (PD) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs is presented. The model uses a single expression {{to model the}} channel current, thereby ensuring continuous transition between all operating regions. Furthermore, care has been taken {{to ensure that this}} expression is also infinitely differentiable, resulting in smooth and continuous conductances and capacitances as well as higher order derivatives. Floating-body effects, which are particular to PD SOI and which are of concern to analog circuit designers in this technology, are well modeled. Small geometry effects such as channel length modulation (CLM), drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), charge sharing, and high field mobility effects have also been included. Self-heating (SH) effects are much more apparent in SOI devices than in equivalent bulk devices. These have been modeled in a consistent manner, and the implementation in SPICE 3 f 5 gives the user an additional <b>thermal</b> <b>node</b> which allows internal device temperature rises to be monitored and also accommodates the modeling of coupled heating between separate devices.

The program also estimates the maximum power load supportable by body fixed solar panels. The program assumes a circular orbit and fixed vertical or horizontal attitude.

Program inputs include: altitude, mass, surface dimensions, thermal properties, electrical power system parameters (efficiencies, degradation, battery depth of discharge and solar cell packing factors), solar position (beta angle) and intensity, planet IR, albedo and equipment power dissipation during sunlight and eclipse. Thermal outputs include upper, average and lower temperatures. Power outputs include required battery capacity and maximum supportable power load.

40|$|Integrated {{modeling}} of spacecraft systems is a rapidly evolving {{area in which}} multidisciplinary models are developed to design and analyze spacecraft configurations. These models are especially important in the early design stages where rapid trades between subsystems can substantially impact design decisions. Integrated modeling {{is one of the}} cornerstones of two of NASA's planned missions in the Origins Program [...] the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) and the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). Common modeling tools for control design and opto-mechanical analysis have recently emerged and are becoming increasingly widely used. A discipline that has been somewhat less integrated, but is nevertheless of critical concern for high precision optical instruments, is thermal analysis and design. A major factor contributing to this mild estrangement is that the modeling philosophies and objectives for structural and thermal systems typically do not coincide. Consequently the tools that are used in these discplines suffer a degree of incompatibility, each having developed along their own evolutionary path. Although standard thermal tools have worked relatively well in the past. integration with other disciplines requires revisiting modeling assumptions and solution methods. Over the past several years we have been developing a MATLAB based integrated modeling tool called IMOS (Integrated Modeling of Optical Systems) which integrates many aspects of structural, optical, control and dynamical analysis disciplines. Recent efforts have included developing a thermal modeling and analysis capability, which {{is the subject of this}} article. Currently, the IMOS thermal suite contains steady state and transient heat equation solvers, and the ability to set up the linear conduction network from an IMOS finite element model. The IMOS code generates linear conduction elements associated with plates and beams/rods of the thermal network directly from the finite element structural model. Conductances for temperature varying materials are accommodated. This capability both streamlines the process of developing the thermal model from the finite element model, and also makes the structural and thermal models compatible in the sense that each structural node is associated with a <b>thermal</b> <b>node.</b> This is particularly useful when the purpose of the analysis is to predict structural deformations due to thermal loads. The steady state solver uses a restricted step size Newton method, and the transient solver is an adaptive step size implicit method applicable to general differential algebraic systems. Temperature dependent conductances and capacitances are accommodated by the solvers. In addition to discussing the modeling and solution methods. applications where the thermal modeling is "in the loop" with sensitivity analysis, optimization and optical performance drawn from our experiences with the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), and the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) are presented...|$|E

40|$|SINDA/FLUINT {{has been}} found to be a {{versatile}} code for modeling aerospace systems involving single or two-phase fluid flow and all modes of heat transfer. Several applications of SINDA/FLUINT are described in this paper. SINDA/FLUINT is being used extensively to model the single phase water loops and the two-phase ammonia loops of the Space Station Freedom active thermal control system (ATCS). These models range from large integrated system models with multiple submodels to very detailed subsystem models. An integrated Space Station ATCS model has been created with ten submodels representing five water loops, three ammonia loops, a Freon loop and a thermal submodel representing the air loop. The model, which has approximately 800 FLUINT lumps and 300 <b>thermal</b> <b>nodes,</b> is used to determine the interaction between the multiple fluid loops which comprise the Space Station ATCS. Several detailed models of the flow-through radiator subsystem of the Space Station ATCS have been developed. One model, which has approximately 70 FLUINT lumps and 340 <b>thermal</b> <b>nodes,</b> provides a representation of the ATCS low temperature radiator array with two fluid loops connected only by conduction through the radiator face sheet. The detailed models are used to determine parameters such as radiator fluid return temperature, fin efficiency, flow distribution and total heat rejection for the baseline design as well as proposed alternate designs. SINDA/FLUINT has also been used as a design tool for several systems using pressurized gasses. One model examined the pressurization and depressurization of the Space Station airlock under a variety of operating conditions including convection with the side walls and internal cooling. Another model predicted the performance of a new generation of manned maneuvering units. This model included high pressure gas depressurization, internal heat transfer and supersonic thruster equations. The results of both models were used to size components, such as the heaters and gas bottles and also to point to areas where hardware testing was needed...|$|R

40|$|VIC 5. 0. 0 Release date: (September 2, 2016) Source code is {{available}} here: This {{is a major}} update from VIC 4. The VIC 5. 0. 0 release aims to have nearly identical physics as VIC 4. 2 while providing a clean, refactored code base supporting multiple drivers. There {{are a number of}} new features, bug fixes, and backward incompatible changes. See the VIC Github page for more details on the changes included in this release. New Features: 	 	"vic_run" (GH# 7) 	Although the physics and model behavior of VIC 5. 0. 0 should be nearly identical to VIC 4. 2, the source code has undergone a major cleanup and reorganization. We have separated the physical core ("vic_run") from the driver source code. This work has improved the extensibility and readability of the model. 	 	 	Classic Driver (GH# 7) 	The Classic Driver provides similar functionality as VIC 4, including ASCII and binary I/O, and a time-before-space evaluation loop order. The Classic Driver is maintained for two main reasons: 	 		to provide some level of backward compatibility for existing VIC users that wish to continue using VIC using a traditional approach, and, 		to allow VIC to be run at individual grid cells, without requiring the infrastructure needed by the Image Driver. Documentation for the Classic Driver can be found here. 	 	 	 	Image Driver (GH# 7) 	The Image Driver adds a number of features to the user interface of the VIC model. Most notably, it uses a space-before-time evaluation loop order, netCDF I/O, and parallelization using MPI. Image Driver specific documentation can be found here. 	 	 	Constants File (GH# 192) 	Earlier versions of VIC included many hard-coded parameters and constants. We have consolidated these constants into a single structure and developed an input file that allows users to modify parameters at run-time. See here for more information. 	 	 	Logging (GH# 173) 	A set of logging Macros have been added to all drivers and vic_run. The logging level can be set in the driver Makefile via the LOG_LVL variable. The logging Macros provide the filename and line number in the source code to aid in debugging. Additionally, when compiler support {{is available}}, a traceback is printed when VIC exits during runtime. When the LOG_DIR variable is provided in the global parameter file, VIC will write its log(s) to log files instead of printing to stdout. 	 	 	Sub-hourly Timestep (GH# 188) 	Previous versions of VIC were limited to a minimum timestep of one hour. The units of the VIC timestep have been changed from hours to seconds and the minimum timestep is now one second. If you intend on running VIC at a timestep of less than one hour, we suggest extensive testing. 	 	 	Calendar Support (GH# 188) 	Earlier versions of VIC used the standard Gregorian calendar. Because many modern climate models use non-standard calendars, we have implemented all CF compliant calendars. The standard Gregorian calendar remains the VIC default. See the documentation for individual drivers for how to set the calendar option (e. g. classic. 	 	 	Sample Datasets (GH# 387) 	The VIC_sample_data repository contains the necessary input datasets (forcings and parameters) to run short simulations of the VIC model for both the classic and image driver. 	 	 	Tests Datasets (GH# 79) 	See [URL] for more information. A temporary location of the test data is here: ftp://ftp. hydro. washington. edu/pub/gergel/VIC 5 _test_data/ 	 	 	Testing and Continuous Integration (GH# 190) 	A comprehensive testing platform has been implemented and is available for public use along with the VIC model. A small subset of the test platform is run on Travis-CI, which facilitates continuous integration of the VIC test platform. More information on the test platform is here. 	 	 	Run-time profiling and timing (GH# 442) 	A timing module has been added to VIC in order to assess the computational cost and throughput of the VIC model. New output variables (OUT_TIME_VICRUN_WALL and OUT_TIME_VICRUN_CPU) document the time spent in vic_run for each variable. Additionally, a timing table is printed to LOG_DEST {{at the end of each}} simulation. 	 Backwards Incompatible Changes: 	 	Classic Driver I/O Formatting (GH# 18, GH# 204, GH# 227) 	The format of ASCII forcing and output files has changed in VIC 5. These changes were motivated by the desire to improve simulation metadata tracking and reproducibility of VIC simulations. 	 		Output files now include a header with simulation metadata and variable names. The PRT_HEADER option has been deprecated. 	 	 	 	Classic Driver Global Parameter Options 	A number of global parameter options have changed for the Classic Driver, relative to VIC 4. 	 		TIME_STEP (int, units: hours) has been changed to MODEL_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		SNOW_STEP (int, units: hours) has been changed to SNOW_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		OUT_DT (int, units: hours) has been changed to OUTPUT_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		FORCE_DT (int, units: hours) has been changed to FORCE_STEPS_PER_DAY (int) 		BINARY_STATE_FILE (TRUE or FALSE) has been changed to STATE_FORMAT (BINARY or ASCII) 		BINARY_OUTPUT (TRUE or FALSE) has been changed to OUT_FORMAT (BINARY or ASCII) 	 	 	 	State files now include seconds (GH# 464) 	 		There is a new global parameter option, STATESEC. This specifies the time step at the end of which state will be saved, in units of seconds. In other words, if you have an hourly time step (3600 sec) and you want to save state at the end of the final time step of the day (which is 86400 seconds long), subtract 3600 from 86400 to get a STATESEC of 82800. This corresponds to the first second of the final time step. State will be saved at the end of that time step. 		When the state save date is appended to state filenames, STATESEC will be included so that the date will have the format YYYYMMDD_SSSSS. 	 	 	 	Classic Driver Output Variables (GH# 352) 	Computation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) has been simplified, reducing the number of output variables from 6 to 1. The following output variables have been removed: 	 		OUT_PET_SATSOIL (potential evapotranspiration from saturated bare soil) 		OUT_PET_H 2 OSURF (potential evapotranspiration from open water) 		OUT_PET_SHORT (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from short reference crop (grass)) 		OUT_PET_TALL (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from tall reference crop (alfalfa)) 		OUT_PET_NATVEG (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from current vegetation and current canopy resistance) 		OUT_PET_VEGNOCR (potential evapotranspiration (transpiration only) from current vegetation and 0 canopy resistance) 	 	These have been replaced by: 	 		OUT_PET (potential evapotranspiration, which = area-weighted sum of potential transpiration and potential soil evaporation; potential transpiration is computed using the Penman-Monteith equation with architectural resistance and LAI of the current veg cover) 	 	 Deprecated Features: 	Removed unused global parameter option MEASURE_H (GH# 284) 	 	Removed MTCLIM (GH# 288) 	Previous versions of VIC used MTCLIM to generate missing forcing variables required to run VIC. This led to confusion by many users and considerably more complex code in the Classic Driver. VIC forcings are now required to be provided at the same time frequency as the model will be run at (SNOW_STEPS_PER_DAY). 	As part of this change, the following options have been removed from the Classic Driver: 	 		LW_TYPE 		LW_CLOUD 		MTCLIM_SWE_CORR 		VP_INTERP 		VP_ITER 		OUTPUT_FORCE 	 	As part of this change, the following output variables have been removed from the Classic Driver: 	 		OUT_COSZEN 		OUT_TSKC 	 	In the future, we would like to provide a stand-alone version of MTCLIM that produces subdaily meteorological forcings. We are looking for community support for this feature (GH# 17) 	 	 	Removed LONGWAVE and SHORTWAVE forcing types (GH# 379). 	Previous versions of VIC allowed users to specify either LONGWAVE or LWDOWN to denote the incoming longwave radiation flux and SHORTWAVE or SWDOWN to denote the incoming shortwave radiation flux. We have removed these duplicate options, standardizing on the more descriptive LWDOWN and SWDOWN. 	Similarly, output variables OUT_NET_LONG and OUT_NET_SHORT have been replaced with OUT_LWNET and OUT_SWNET, respectively. 	 	 	Changed the name of the variable VEGCOVER to FCANOPY, since this more accurately captures the meaning of the term (i. e., the fractional area of the plant canopy within the veg tile). Similarly changed OUT_VEGCOVER to OUT_FCANOPY. 	Similarly, changed the names of the following global parameter file options: 	 		VEGLIB_VEGCOVER [...] > VEGLIB_FCAN 		VEGPARAM_VEGCOVER [...] > VEGPARAM_FCAN 		VEGCOVER_SRC [...] > FCAN_SRC 	 	 Bug Fixes: 	 	Miscellaneous fixes to lake module (GH# 425) 	Several lake processes (aerodynamic resistance, albedo, latent/sensible heat fluxes, net radiation, etc) were reported incorrectly or not at all in output files. This has been fixed. In addition, in the absence of an initial state file, lake temperatures were initialized to unrealistic temperatures (the air temperature of the first simulation time step). To fix this, we now initialize the lake temperature to annual average soil temperature. 	 	 	Fix for computation of soil layer temperatures when soil <b>thermal</b> <b>nodes</b> do not reach the bottom of the soil column. (GH# 467) 	Previously, if the soil thermal damping depth was shallower than the bottom of the deepest soil layer, and FROZEN_SOIL==TRUE, VIC would abort when estimating layer ice contents because it could not estimate a layer temperature if the <b>thermal</b> <b>nodes</b> did not completely span the layer. Now, a layer temperature is estimated even when <b>thermal</b> <b>nodes</b> do not completely span the layer, and the error no longer occurs. 	 	 	Fix related to exact restart (GH# 481, GH# 507, GH# 509) 	Previously, VIC did not produce the same results (fluxes and states) if a simulation was separated into multiple shorter-period runs by saving the state variables and restarting. This was due to: 	 		 		The MTCLIM algorithm resulted in slightly different sub-daily meteorological variable values for different lengths of forcings (MTCLIM is deprecated in the current version) 		 		 		A few bugs resulting in inexact restart. The following bugs have been fixed: 		 			The prognostic state variable energy. Tfoliage (foliage temperature) is now saved to the state file 			 			Two flux variables energy. LongUnderOut and energy. snow_flux are now saved to the state file. 			!!!Note This is a temporary solution to ensure exact restart. A better way of handling these two flux variables needs to be done in the future (see GH# 479) 			 		 		 	 	 	 	Fix for binary state file I/O (GH# 487) 	Fixed a bug so that the binary format state file I/O works correctly. 	 	 	Fix for a physical constant (water heat capacity) (GH# 574) 	Fixed a bug where volumetric heat capacity of water should be used in func_canopy_energy_bal (previously specific heat capacity was used) ...|$|R

The dispatched power of the wind farm is constrained by the ability of the restored system to withstand power fluctuations. As the output power of the wind farms increases, the likelihood of transient power sags becomes the main constraint for the optimization of the dispatched power. Taking the output power at 40  min as an example, although the capacity of energized wind farms is 640  MW, the output power of wind farms is only 220  MW to mitigate the impact of transient power sags. The ability of the restored system to withstand power fluctuation is gradually improved due to energized thermal units connecting to the restoring system, for example, the total output power of wind farms is improved at 32  min because of the <b>thermal</b> units in <b>node</b> 37 connected to the restored system.|$|R

40|$|The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Spacecraft {{made use}} of aerobraking to {{gradually}} reduce its orbit period from a highly elliptical insertion orbit to its final science orbit. Aerobraking produces a high heat load on the solar arrays, which have a large surface area exposed to the airflow and relatively low mass. To accurately model the complex behavior during aerobraking, the thermal analysis needed to be tightly coupled to the spatially varying, time dependent aerodynamic heating. Also, the thermal model itself needed to accurately capture {{the behavior of the}} solar array and its response to changing heat load conditions. The correlation of the thermal model to flight data allowed a validation of the modeling process, as well as information on what processes dominate the thermal behavior. Correlation in this case primarily involved detailing the <b>thermal</b> sensor <b>nodes,</b> using as-built mass to modify material property estimates, refining solar cell assembly properties, and adding detail to radiation and heat flux boundary conditions. This paper describes the methods used to develop finite element thermal models of the MGS solar array and the correlation of the thermal model to flight data from the spacecraft drag passes. Correlation was made to data from four flight thermal sensors over three of the early drag passes. Good correlation of the model was achieved, with a maximum difference between the predicted model maximum and the observed flight maximum temperature of less than 5 %. Lessons learned in the correlation of this model assisted in validating a similar model and method used for the Mars Odyssey solar array aeroheating analysis, which were used during onorbit operations...|$|R

Bearing elements, shaft, carrier, housing, cryogen flow characteristics, friction heat, and fluid viscous energy {{are included in the}} model. Heat transfer characteristics for the regimes of forced convection boiling are modeled for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid nitrogen (LN 2). Large temperature differences between the cryogenic fluid and baring contact surfaces require detailed nodal representation in these areas. Internal loads and friction heat are affected by temperature dependent operating clearances requiring iterations between bearing thermal and mechanical models. Analyses indicate a thermal-mechanical coupling resulting in reduced operating clearances, increased loading and heating which can contribute to premature bearing failure. Contact surfaces operate at temperatures above local saturation resulting in vapor rather than liquid in the contacts, precluding possible liquid film lubrication. Elevated temperatures can reduce lubrication, increase friction, and reduce surface hardness supporting a surface failure mode rather than subsurface fatigue...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpin-transfer torque {{magnetic}} {{random access}} memory (STT-RAM) is a promising and emerging technology due to its many advantageous features such as scalability, nonvolatility, density, endurance, and fast access speed. However, the operation of STT-RAM is severely affected by environmental factors such as process variations and temperature. As the temperature rockets up in modern computing systems, it is highly desirable to understand thermal impact on STT-RAM operations and reliability. In this paper, a thermal-aware MTJ model, calibrated and validated by experimental measurements, is proposed as the basis for thoroughly thermal aware analysis of a 1 T 1 MTJ STT-RAM cell structure. Using this model, we investigate temperature effect on memory cell access behavior in terms of access latency, energy, and reliability on a 45 -nm technology <b>node.</b> <b>Thermal</b> impact on a more advanced 11 -nm technology node is also evaluated in the paper. Additionally, we propose a thermal-aware design for STT-RAM sensing circuit using a body-biasing technique, which can enlarge read margin dramatically to enhance read reliability under temperature variations. Moreover, our proposed technique can suppress read disturbance effectively as well. Experimental results show that our proposed sensing circuit can enlarge read margin by 2. 47 × when reading “ 0 ” and 3. 15 × when reading “ 1,” and reduce read disturbance error rate by 55. 6 % on average...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Network-on-Chip (NoC) is an {{important}} technology that replaced the traditional bus-based architecture {{for the future of}} System-on-Chip (SoC). The NoC system provides better scalability, performance, reliability, etc. to the SoC networks by implementing the principles of interconnection networks and packet switching. One of the major problems in NoC is the increase in temperature of the nodes that leads to unbalanced thermal management within the network. This further leads to performance degradation due to damaged <b>nodes.</b> A novel <b>thermal</b> management scheme is proposed in this paper, which makes use of the thermal state and buffer state of the nodes for routing the packets. The proposed Prioritized Thermo-Buffer based Adaptive Routing (PT-BAR) protocol maintains a thermal region based on the thermal balance of the nodes within the region. Only high priority packets are transferred through the thermal region to preserve thermal balance throughout the network. During packet transfers the thermo-buffer model considers the energy consumption and <b>thermal</b> conductivity of <b>nodes</b> to calculate temperature and the current buffer state of the node. This factor is used to choose a path that will provide better performance in end-to-end delay and throughput while preserving the thermal balance of the network. Proposed PT-BAR reduces the temperature by 1. 5 ° C than the existing protocol by making use of the efficient thermal model and buffer models for the efficient routing strategy...|$|R

The future research work aims at improving the reliability of CICADA [14] which performs better in terms of energy efficiency and average delay {{when compared to other}} cross layered protocols. When IEEE 802.15. 4 standard networks are used, it will be good if the TICOSS [15] protocol is redesigned for reducing the average delay which is not considered in the existing one. If the entire network performance is to be optimized, the choice will be the Biocomm protocols along with new techniques to reduce the node temperature. Hence, the scope for research in this area is very much wide enough to work with. The comparative analysis of postural movement protocols has shown that, none of them considered the <b>thermal</b> effects of <b>nodes</b> and QoS issues together. Therefore, the future protocols could be proposed in such a way that, it could achieve better QoS parameters along with techniques to reduce the node temperature rise and methods to counter security attacks. The survey on QoS aware protocols unveils various research areas for future work because of its importance. Every new protocol, which has been designed, is meant for addressing the limitation of the previous one. For example, in routing service framework [56] and reinforcement learning based routing with QoS support [55] the energy consumption is not considered, but it is taken into account in the remaining protocols.|$|R
