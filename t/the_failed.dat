To facilitate better analysis, additional fail information beyond a simple pass/fail is collected into a <b>fail</b> log. <b>The</b> <b>fail</b> log typically contains information about when (e.g., tester cycle), where (e.g., at what tester channel), and how (e.g., logic value) <b>the</b> test <b>failed.</b> Diagnostics attempt to derive from <b>the</b> <b>fail</b> log at which logical/physical location inside the chip the problem most likely started. By running a large number of failures through the diagnostics process, called volume diagnostics, systematic failures can be identified.|$|R

40|$|We present {{energy and}} free energy {{analyses}} on all variational schemes {{used in the}} spin-boson model at both T= 0 and T≠ 0. It is found that all the variational schemes have fail points, at where <b>the</b> variational schemes <b>fail</b> to provide a lower energy (or a lower free energy at T≠ 0) than the displaced-oscillator ground state and therefore the variational ground state becomes unstable, which results in a transition from a variational ground state to a displaced oscillator ground state when <b>the</b> <b>fail</b> point is reached. Such transitions are always misidentied as crossover from a delocalized to localized phases in variational calculations, leading to an artifact of phonon-induced localization. Physics origin of <b>the</b> <b>fail</b> points and explanations for different transition behaviors with different spectral functions are found by studying <b>the</b> <b>fail</b> points of <b>the</b> variational schemes in the single mode case.

5|$|Ahead of <b>the</b> <b>failed</b> Nordic bid to {{host the}} Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans {{to host the}} Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. <b>The</b> <b>failed</b> Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
