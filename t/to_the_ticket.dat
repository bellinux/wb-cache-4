5|$|The new {{station was}} {{constructed}} in an Art Deco/Streamline Moderne design by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell. Like Holden's other designs for London Underground in the 1930s, East Finchley station was inspired by European architecture (particularly Dutch) that Holden had seen on trips to the continent during that decade. The track here runs roughly north-west to south-east. The imposing station building, built on rising ground adjacent to the railway bridge over High Road (A1000), has three entrances. The two main entrances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> hall are {{on the north side}} of the tracks facing High Road and the third, minor entrance, is on the south side. The entrances are linked by a passage under the tracks which provides access up to the platforms.|$|E

50|$|Ability <b>to</b> view <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is {{important}} <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> service provider {{and the owner}} of <b>the</b> <b>ticket.</b> <b>The</b> owner needs <b>to</b> know what his ticket actually is and the service provider needs <b>to</b> verify <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> during redemption. <b>The</b> view could be achieved by properly designed hardware.|$|R

25|$|Central Trains {{undertook}} internal modifications and refurbishment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> {{office and}} booking hall {{towards the end}} of their franchise. Network Rail also invested £500,000 on refurbishment of the station building, modern lighting, overbridge and foot crossing to further update the station in late 2007.|$|E
50|$|Automation Server: HEAT {{includes}} Business Process Automation Module (BPAM).

25|$|As Bush lagged in {{the polls}} in the weeks {{preceding}} the August 1992 Republican National Convention, some Republican strategists (led by Secretary of State James Baker) viewed Quayle as a liability <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> and pushed for his replacement. Quayle ultimately survived the challenge and secured renomination.|$|E
25|$|When the Republicans {{met for the}} nominating {{convention}} in Columbia on September 13 through September 15, Governor Chamberlain was renominated with little difficulty. However, those opposed to Chamberlain sought to compensate for their defeat by adding themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket.</b> Robert B. Elliott became the nominee for attorney general and Thomas C. Dunn the nominee for comptroller general.|$|E
25|$|As of late 2013 {{the main}} station {{entrance}} and booking hall were closed due to extensive repairs being required <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> office {{floor and the}} replacement of the station's glazed roof. This enabled a Georgian wire glass to be put back in place and various lime mortar repairs and the flagpole being replaced with one of GRP and stainless steel.|$|E
25|$|All {{tickets are}} {{available}} at any station either through a machine or at <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> office. Tickets must be 'tapped' on <b>the</b> card reader <b>to</b> validate <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> and must be retained for exit.|$|R

25|$|Sarriko station won the 1998 Brunel Award for Railway Design. It is noticeably {{different}} from the rest of the stations in the network: in place of the standard 'fosterito', a vast glazed atrium pours natural light into the entire station, and the long, unbroken escalator ride <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> hall from street level gives a dramatic sense of character to the station.|$|E
25|$|On Boxing Day, {{over the}} years many fans have chosen to attend Wigan Athletic's match in fancy dress. This is {{particularly}} prominent with away fixtures on that day where the fans are known as the 'Banana Army'. However, on Boxing Day in 2014 a boycott of the club's fixture against Leeds United was ordered by some supporters due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> prices for the match at Elland Road. Around 750 away fans attended the match.|$|E
25|$|Located in {{the western}} corner of the site {{adjacent}} to Bowen Park the building is a single-storey structure comprising two smaller elements separated by an access gate. The walls of the buildings are face brick and each has a hipped roof clad with metal custom orb sheeting. Recent additions to these structures appear to include the cement rendering of the brickwork to the Bowen Bridge Street facade and the installation of metal roller doors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> issuing areas.|$|E

50|$|Mayhem {{and murder}} ensue, {{prompting}} lazy detectives Lakewood (Bill Pullman) and Chambers (Daryl Mitchell) to initiate an investigation {{they hope will}} not be too taxing. Russ decides <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>to</b> Dick for $100,000 to get clear of the debt he owes to Dale. Crystal is irate, and she immediately seduces Dick {{to get back into}} her share of the winnings. Dale breaks into Dick's house and tries <b>to</b> rob <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> from him, but the police arrive, and Lakewood ends up killing him.|$|R
50|$|Its wall attracts many tourists. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> {{for access}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall, {{construction}} of the wall, originally over 6 km long, began in the Jin Dynasty (265-420) and was not finished until the Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907) Dynasties. The northern portion, along a high ridge, and the western & southern portions, along the Lin River, still exist and are in good condition.|$|R
25|$|As the Great Depression {{continued}} to ravage the United States, Dawes accepted President Herbert Hoover's appeal to leave diplomatic office and head {{the newly created}} Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). But after a few months, Dawes resigned from the RFC. As {{a board member of}} the failing City National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, he felt obligated to work for its rescue. Political opponents alleged that, under Dawes' leadership, the RFC had given his bank preferential treatment. This marked the end of Dawes' career in public service. For the 1932 election, Hoover considered the possibility of adding Dawes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> in place of Curtis, but Dawes declined the potential offer.|$|E
25|$|Lotto designs model any lottery that is {{run in the}} {{following}} way: Individuals purchase tickets consisting of k numbers chosen from a set of n numbers. At a certain point the sale of tickets is stopped {{and a set of}} p numbers is randomly selected from the n numbers. These are the winning numbers. If any sold ticket contains t or more of the winning numbers, a prize is given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> holder. Larger prizes go to tickets with more matches. The value of L(n,k,p,t) is of interest to both gamblers and researchers, as this is the smallest number of tickets that are needed to be purchased in order to guarantee a prize.|$|E
25|$|Mount {{had been}} {{approached}} {{several times to}} run for public office by the Republican Party, to which he belonged, but had always refused. In 1888 he was nominated {{to run for the}} Indiana State Senate, despite his protests. The party at that time was losing farming votes to the Populist Party, and bringing farmers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> was seen as a way to reverse the trend. He reluctantly accepted the nomination expecting to lose, but won the election in an ordinarily Democratic-controlled district. In the Democratic-controlled Senate he submitted no legislation of his own, but did support several measures he believed would benefit the farming community, including increasing funding for state agricultural programs.|$|E
50|$|Granville {{station is}} unique in being {{one of only a}} few {{stations}} having no surface entrance building of its own, independent of any adjacent buildings (Main Street-Science World station is another for example). The station has three entrances: Granville Mall through the Hudson’s Bay Company department store, Seymour Street with direct access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticketing</b> platform, and Dunsmuir Street through The Hudson condominium development.|$|R

25|$|Roosevelt's plan to {{convince}} Hoover {{to run for}} the Democratic nomination fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt nonetheless decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the party formally nominated Roosevelt by acclamation. Although his nomination surprised most people, Roosevelt was considered as bringing balance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name. Roosevelt had just turned 38, four years younger than Theodore had been when he received the same nomination from his party. Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the Cox–Roosevelt ticket.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the ticket hall is an office and service room for the station manager. Parts of the timber framing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> windows are visible on its {{south-eastern}} wall. The floors are carpeted and the walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a terrazzo different from that {{on the floor in the}} ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a terrazzo tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is face brick, while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior terrazzo sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet cubicles and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre sill height. Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E
