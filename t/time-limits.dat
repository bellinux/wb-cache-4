25|$|While the Japanese fight media rejoiced and {{elevated}} Sakuraba to superstar status, the Gracie family took great umbrage over the incident, {{feeling that they}} had been cheated by Pride. Despite Sakuraba challenging Royler's older brother Rickson Gracie after the match, it was his younger brother and former UFC Champion Royce Gracie who, compelled {{to set the record straight}} and re-assert the dominance of his family, returned to the sport of mixed martial arts in 2000 and entered the 16-Man Pride Grand Prix alongside Sakuraba and several other top fighters of the era. Placed on the same side of the bracket, a special set of rules were requested by the Gracies in the event of a Sakuraba-Royce match, including no referee stoppages and no <b>time-limits,</b> the fight ending only in the event of a submission or knock-out (something prohibited in modern MMA because of the widely adopted Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts limiting matches to 25 minutes overall, 5 x 5 minute rounds). In his first fight of the 2000 Pride tournament Sakuraba once again found himself matched up against a heavier opponent, this time the well-regarded 205 pound fighter, former King of Pancrase Guy Mezger. After a closely fought 15 minutes the judges requested an overtime round, and the fight ended in controversy when Mezger's coach Ken Shamrock forced his fighter back to the locker room claiming that no additional rounds were agreed upon in the contract. Sakuraba ended up winning the match by forfeit. Meanwhile, Royce defeated Nobuhiko Takada by unanimous decision and thus set the stage for their much anticipated showdown.|$|E

The questionnaire sample collected from consumers visiting two annual International Travel Fairs in Taiwan, 2007.

In addition, perceived value is served as a mediating factor between the relationship of <b>time-limited</b> pressure and purchase intention.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{sampling}} and reconstruction of <b>time-limited</b> signals. Finite-energy, <b>time-limited</b> signals can be represented using <b>time-limited</b> orthogonal Fourier basis functions, and a finite linear combination can approximate a signal with the assumption that most of the signal energy is concentrated in a certain frequency band. The expansion coefficients in this approximation are uniform samples of the frequency spectrum. As <b>time-limited</b> signals are not bandlimited, we propose the use of finite-duration sum-of-sincs sampling kernel, which annihilates the effect of aliasing at desired frequency locations with a suitable choice of the sampling frequency. This method does not require inner product operations for each coefficient in the expansion. An expression for the approximation error is derived. Experiments are performed on both simulated and natural <b>time-limited</b> signals and compared with widely used Shannon-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction method. The reconstruction error using the proposed method is smaller by 2 - 20 dB compared with the Shannon-Nyquist method...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} experience of existential counselling psychologists and psychotherapists providing <b>time-limited</b> therapy. Ten participants were interviewed, using semi-structured interviews, focusing on the emotions, meaning-making processes and attitudes that constitute their experience. The material was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis - IPA. Five superordinate themes were identified, highlighting the main constituents of {{the experience of}} existential therapists in <b>time-limited</b> settings: the experience of time-limitation, the experience of ending, the experience of the therapeutic process, attitudes towards <b>time-limited</b> therapy and support systems. Existing literature on <b>time-limited</b> therapy and the existential approach was utilised to shed light on the results and to reach {{a better understanding of the}} implications that this study has on the existential approach, supervisory and training settings, and counselling psychology. It is suggested that existential <b>time-limited</b> therapy is particularly relevant for the widespread provision of <b>time-limited</b> therapies, and its application is based on three main values: the philosophical value, the relational value and the holistic value. The importance of support systems for therapists providing existential <b>time-limited</b> therapy, in the form of supervision and training, was also highlighted, with reference to the particular challenges and opportunities that such a work entails. Finally, the contribution of this study to the division of Counselling Psychology, and the necessity for such a research in order to safeguard the division’s values, promote its pluralistic identity, and provide ethical and competent services to those in need, is also presented...|$|R
30|$|Wage {{subsidies}} are either paid indefinitely, {{so long as}} the worker remains eligible, or are <b>time-limited.</b> <b>Time-limited</b> {{subsidies are}} usually targeted on newly hired workers who were previously unemployed (sometimes within a demographic or geographic class). For example, Colombia subsidizes firms that hire women over the age of 40 who have been unemployed at least 12 months. Common durations for <b>time-limited</b> subsidies are six months to two years. There are several different rationales for <b>time-limited</b> subsidies. In some cases, they are used as a countercyclical measure to combat a rise in unemployment. The “learning-by-doing” theory also justifies temporary subsidies after which workers are expected to have acquired sufficient skills to make them productive enough for finding employment on an unsubsidized basis. If this is the case, <b>time-limiting</b> the subsidy is one way to achieve the employment effects of wage subsidies while greatly reducing windfall effects. As noted above, however, if the learning-by-doing hypothesis does not hold true, or if the duration of the subsidy is not sufficient to significantly enhance the worker’s skills, <b>time-limited</b> subsidies create only a temporary employment effect and, at the same time, create a perverse incentive for “churning” – letting workers go when their subsidy expires and replacing them with new subsidized workers.|$|R
