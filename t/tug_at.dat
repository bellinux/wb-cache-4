In January 1899, she was reassigned to the Cuban {{occupation}} forces and was based at Havana, Cuba. Between late 1900 and December 1911, the small ship successively served as a yard <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> Port Royal, South Carolina, Key West, and Pensacola, Florida. On 4 December 1911, Accomac arrived at the Boston Navy Yard where she spent the remainder of her active career. She was renamed Nottoway on 1 August 1918.|$|E
25|$|Amerike – The Golden Land {{tells the}} journey of America’s Jewish {{ancestors}} who emigrated from their towns and cities in Europe and Russia (especially the Pale of Settlement) {{to start a new}} life in America. The characters in this story start off with a tremendous amount of hope in leaving their homes and starting new lives in NYC. However, their notions of America as a free land are shattered at Ellis Island when they witness families being torn apart to Ellis Island’s selection process. Life turns out to be quite difficult in America, the characters in the show soon discover. Poor wages, long hours, and sweatshop conditions are horrors that <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> the seams of the characters. Events such as the Triangle Factory Fire, Workers Unionization, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, The Great Depression, World War I, and the Holocaust – World War II are telling points of the story in showing these immigrants growth, participation, and contribution to American economy and culture. The story ends on a hopeful and spirited note where survivors of the Holocaust are welcomed into the United States by the immigrants who fought to create a life for themselves there. Told in popular songs of the day, Amerike – The Golden Land is performed in Yiddish with Russian and English supertitles.|$|E
500|$|Earl Wasserman, in 1953, {{continued}} the discussion {{over the final}} lines and claimed, [...] "the more we <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> the final lines of the ode, the more the noose of their meaning strangles our comprehension of the poem... The aphorism {{is all the more}} beguiling because it appears {{near the end of the}} poem, for its apparently climactic position has generally led to the assumption that it is the abstract summation of the poem... But the ode is not an abstract statement or an excursion into philosophy. It is a poem about things".|$|E

Kelcey Shipley from MTV News praised his version for its [...] "simplicity" [...] while Killian Young of Rolling Stone shortly {{described it as}} [...] "sweet". Spins Marc Hogan noted that [...] "XO" [...] was a [...] "perfect song for him" [...] and described it as [...] "a person-to-person romantic exchange, transferred over to acoustic instruments but no less stadium-sized – or pop – for it." [...] Lauren Nostro writing for Complex deemed Mayer's live rendition of the song [...] "impressive" [...] before adding that the harmonica, [...] "will <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> your heart strings {{almost as much as}} the original song".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} both written and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays the part of Toby Flenderson on the show. In the episode, Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam ("JandP2") post a review, which can be seen on the actual reviews page. It reads: [...] "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> your heart strings.

From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers." ...|$|E

[...] Dean and Patti Reeves stated, [...] "It is a great honor {{to think that a}} horse with such humble beginnings could intertwine the lives and stories of so many people, and <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> the heartstrings of racing fans from all over the world." [...] At the end of 2013, Mucho Macho Man was the number one-ranked horse for the year in North American purse winnings, higher than rivals Will Take Charge and Game On Dude {{as well as the other}} two top five contenders Orb and Wise Dan. He was also nominated for two Eclipse Awards, Horse of the Year and Older Male Horse, but finished second in both categories to Wise Dan.|$|E

500|$|Robin Oliver {{rates the}} episode [...] "thumbs up" [...] {{in a review}} in The Sydney Morning Herald, where she says of The Simpsons as a series: [...] "this encouragingly funny show knows how to <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> the heartstrings". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment on the episode in their book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide: [...] "..the {{highlight}} of this episode has to be Marge's training, especially her sharpshooting on the firing range". In {{a review of the}} sixth season of The Simpsons, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes that the episode surpasses the quality of the previous episode [...] "'Round Springfield": [...] "After the dull '’Round', Season Six rebounds with the pretty good 'Connection'. I can’t quite figure out how Marge stays in such good shape, but her escapades as a cop are funny, and the episode works best when she arrests Homer. I especially like his refusal to remain silent." ...|$|E
500|$|Shear's {{original}} version of [...] "All Through the Night" [...] {{is set in}} the key of F major, and proceeds at a tempo of approximately 96 beats per minute. For her cover version, Lauper transposed the key up a minor third to A-flat major, and kept the tempo at the same 96 beats per minute as the original. The song is set in common time. Lauper's voice spans an octave and a fourth between G3 and D♭5. Jules Shear himself makes a guest appearance on Lauper's version, singing a wordless falsetto melody near the end, as well as the lower harmony in the choruses. [...] The chorus was unintentionally altered by Lauper from the Shear version when she heard the upper harmony vocal and thought it was the lead vocal. [...] Lyrically, [...] "All Through the Night" [...] addresses the same concept of love and its <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> heart-strings as was emphasized by Lauper's previous single, [...] "Time After Time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was not void of criticism. Although Richard Corliss of Time thoroughly enjoyed the film, {{he felt that}} too much {{emphasis was placed on}} Flynn Rider and not enough on Rapunzel. Corliss questioned the future of Disney's animated heroines, writing, [...] "For 60 years ... girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age, triumph over adversity and, in general, man up," [...] and accused various film studios of [...] "abolish female-centered stories." [...] Variety's Justin Chang described Rapunzel as a [...] "bland, plastic" [...] heroine, likening her to a Barbie doll. Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out described Rapunzel as [...] "bland". James Berardinelli of ReelViews was fairly mixed in his review, writing, [...] "although likeable and energetic, [...] is not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the character as [...] "synthetic". He wrote, [...] "you never feel like you're watching a girl on the empowering cusp of adulthood so much as a selection of attitudes compiled through demographic study." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn panned the character, describing her as [...] "bland and Valley Girlish". Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, [...] "when the big-eyed heroine tries to <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> our heartstrings and Flynn turns into Prince Charming, the too-familiar hero-and-damsel motif feels like a fashion faux-pas." [...] Similarly, the SouthtownStars Jake Coyle wrote, [...] "Both Rapunzel and Flynn too much resemble Barbie and Ken, lacking both superficial and emotional individuality." [...] Jen Yamato of Movies.com criticized Disney for [...] "failing to give Rapunzel a backbone and retreading ground so familiar you can fall asleep for ten minutes and still know exactly what happened".|$|E

2500|$|Blomkamp {{wanted the}} aliens to {{maintain}} both humanistic and barbaric {{features in the}} design of the creatures. According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, [...] "They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge." [...] The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, [...] "Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. Like if you see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired... If you make a film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, you can go to town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] a {{four out}} of five rating. He felt that when N-Dubz teamed up with Bodyrox for their soundtrack {{contribution}} to StreetDance 3D, they clearly took on board what the film was all about: overcoming prejudices and, the merging of diverse styles of music and dance. Copsey said, [...] "Much like the film itself, 'We Dance On' features an assortment of different influences that might seem contradictory on paper, but inevitably work out for the best in the end." [...] He noted that the verses about pursuing your dreams like a [...] "fox on a mission" [...] and [...] "the big, Bob Marley-inspired chorus – [...] "I know everything's gonna be alright/Now you're standing here by my side" [...] will surely <b>tug</b> <b>at</b> the heartstrings of the song's listener. Copsey {{went on to say that}} the track [...] "leaves you feeling warm, fuzzy and [...] better inside." [...] BBCs Fraser McAlpine felt that [...] "We Dance On" [...] was capable of bringing its listener to tears with, [...] "massive churning string section" [...] from Johann Pachelbel's [...] "Canon in D Major" [...] and few [...] "everything's gonna be alright" [...] chants. McAlpine noted that the string section contains influences from The Farm's [...] "All Together Now" [...] (1990). He went on to interpret the song's chants as being inspired by Bob Marley's [...] "No Woman, No Cry" [...] (1974). Gavin Martin of the Daily Mirror gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] three out of five stars in his review of the single. He highlighted Tulisa Contostavlos' contribution in the song, saying: [...] "Often forced to take a back seat while her male counterparts lead, N-Dubz' front lady Tulisa comes out front for this". Martin went on to describe the song as a [...] "crowd-pleasing and unifying floor filler with a hint of classical spice." ...|$|E
