5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, McCabe {{was called}} up for the 1930 tour of England despite being yet to score his maiden {{first-class}} century as the selectors chose the youngest ever team to leave Australia. McCabe made his first century in a warm-up match but struggled in his month in England, scoring only 51 runs. His performance began to improve after adjusting his technique and he played in all five Tests, although he continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> converting starts into large scores, failing to make a century during the tour. McCabe managed to maintain his position {{over the next two}} home seasons, playing in all ten Tests, but failed to make a century, and after 15 Tests, his average was below 35 although he had become increasingly successful at first-class level.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E

Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> with discipline.

5|$|There are six known genetic {{disorders}} in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia {{of the affected}} animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three {{are thought to be}} autosomal recessive conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E

25|$|All {{individuals}} with A-T {{should have at}} least one comprehensive immunologic evaluation that measures the number and type of lymphocytes in the blood (T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes), the levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and antibody responses to T-dependent (e.g., tetanus, Hemophilus influenzae b) and T-independent (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide) vaccines. For the most part, the pattern of immunodeficiency seen in an A-T patient early in life (by age five) will be the same pattern seen throughout the lifetime of that individual. Therefore, the tests need not be repeated unless that individual develops more problems with infection. Problems with immunity sometimes can be overcome by immunization. Vaccines against common bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Hemophilus influenzae, pneumococci and influenza virus (the “flu”) are commercially available and often help to boost antibody responses, even in {{individuals with}} low immunoglobulin levels. If the vaccines do not work and the patient continues <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> with infections, gamma globulin therapy (IV or subcutaneous infusions of antibodies collected from normal individuals) may be of benefit. A small number of people with A-T develop an abnormality in which one or more types of immunoglobulin are increased far beyond the normal range. In a few cases, the immunoglobulin levels can be increased so much that the blood becomes thick and does not flow properly. Therapy for this problem must be tailored to the specific abnormality found and its severity.|$|E

Results showed that asexuals {{were more likely to}} have low self-esteem and more likely to be depressed than members of other sexual orientations; 25.88% of heterosexuals, 26.54% bisexuals (called [...] "ambisexuals"), 29.88% of homosexuals, and 33.57% of asexuals were reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> with self-esteem. A similar trend existed for depression. Nurius did not believe that firm conclusions can be drawn from this for a variety of reasons.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of Zandvoort, Rindt gained {{confidence}} in the new Lotus 72, describing it as [...] "the best racing car that exists at the moment". But he continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems.</b> During practice for the French Grand Prix, Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek. He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious over yet another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: [...] "If this happens again and I survive, I will kill all of you!" [...] Rindt {{was still able to}} win the race, taking the lead in the championship. The next race was the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx's transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.|$|E
500|$|Ollivierre's most {{successful}} season was 1904, when he scored 1,268 runs {{at an average}} of 34.27. Against Essex, he made the highest score of his career, when, according to his obituary in Wisden, [...] "he was the dominating figure in a remarkable match". Essex scored 597 runs in their first innings; Derbyshire replied with 548, of which Ollivierre made 229. After Essex were bowled out for 97, Derbyshire hit off the required runs to win by nine wickets. Ollivierre was left on 92 not out, and had scored 321 runs in the match. The match report in the 1905 edition of Wisden noted: [...] "In defeating Essex, Derbyshire accomplished the most phenomenal performance ever recorded in first-class cricket... achievement has no parallel {{in the history of the}} game." [...] Over the following seasons, Ollivierre's form faded. In 1905, he scored 759 runs {{at an average of}} 18.07. He improved his average with 752 runs at 25.06 in 1906, including his final first-class century. During that season, he played against a touring West Indian team which included his brother Richard— Ollivierre scored 0 and 64 not out. In 1907, he managed just 417 runs at 12.26. In these later seasons, he began <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> with his eyesight, and was forced to retire from first-class cricket after 1907. In total, he played 114 first-class games, scored 4,830 runs at 23.56 and hit three centuries. However, he continued to play club cricket in Yorkshire and, annually between 1924 and 1939, spent time in the Netherlands coaching in schools. Ollivierre died at Pontefract in Yorkshire on 25 March 1949.|$|E
