5000|$|There was a {{controversy}} about {{the east end}} of <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> of Magellan. Both countries agreed about the boundary line, but not about the end of <b>the</b> <b>Straits.</b> <b>The</b> Chilean view was that <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> ended at <b>the</b> boundary line and eastward continued the Atlantic Ocean and therefore Chile had a [...] "beach" [...] at (and its projection over) the Atlantic Ocean and it enjoyed sole control of <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> themselves. <b>The</b> Argentine view was that <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> continued eastward of the border and that {{the east end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Straits</b> of Magellan belonged to Argentina.

The battleship, along with her sister ships {{and the rest of the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, were mobilized to support the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau from 28 July to 10 August 1914. The two German battlecruisers were stationed in the Mediterranean Sea and were attempting to break out of <b>the</b> <b>strait</b> of Messina, which was surrounded by British troops and vessels, and make their way to Turkey.

5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat that <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> {{would be}} closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through <b>the</b> <b>Strait,</b> and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E

She spent the next five years based in Libya and Italy before Brindisi was disarmed and turned into a depot ship in 1929. The ship was stricken from the Navy List in 1937 and later disposed of.|$|E

Before leaving, the British destroyed Rostislavs engines on April 25. The White forces of Baron Wrangel used the disabled ship as a floating battery in the Sea of Azov. The ship, manned by a ragtag volunteer crew, was stationed in the shallow waters of <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> of Kerch to harass the Reds in Taman and prevent a landing in the Crimea. After the defeat of Wrangel's land forces, the crew scuttled Rostislav in <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> of Kerch to prevent the Red forces from breaking through to the Black Sea.|$|E

On 24 January an action against a larger French squadron was fought in <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> itself, but ended inconclusively and the squadrons divided, the British receiving the Dutch frigate Amazone as reinforcements.

5|$|The {{value of}} the naval base was soon {{apparent}} when the First World War broke out in August 1914. Only {{a few minutes after}} the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day. Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war – Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested {{as it was in the}} Second World War– it played an important role in the Allied fight against the German U-boat campaign. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked <b>the</b> <b>Strait</b> looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through <b>the</b> <b>Strait.</b> Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through <b>the</b> <b>Strait.</b> Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, SM UB-50 torpedoed and sank the British battleship HMS Britannia off Cape Trafalgar to the west of Gibraltar.|$|E
