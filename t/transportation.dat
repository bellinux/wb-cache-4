5|$|Spatial {{economics}} {{deal with}} distance and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through <b>transportation</b> costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how <b>transportation</b> costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower <b>transportation</b> costs. Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to <b>transportation</b> costs; <b>transportation</b> costs vary on <b>transportation</b> type (for example, water <b>transportation</b> was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that {{are more difficult to}} transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and <b>transportation.</b> Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford <b>transportation</b> costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the <b>transportation</b> costs. In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper dwells upon a {{modified}} centre-of-gravity method {{for determining the}} location of a cargo transit terminal (based on the example of Chelyabinsk region) as a multimodal logistic centre. The modified method for calculating the “centre of gravity” for determining the optimal coordinates of a transit terminal is designed to meet the following regulations: if there is some unevenness of cargo flows between any point and the transport node, some part of a rolling stock should be unloaded {{in the direction of a}} lesser traffic flow. The coordinates of the terminal complex are determined similarly to the centre-of-gravity coordinates of a physical system and are treated as a transport problem according to the criterion of minimum total annual costs of goods <b>transportations,</b> storage and redistribution in terminal complexes. The paper analyzes integration of terminal-to-terminal <b>transportations</b> in transit terminal complexes that differ in directions, volumes and regional destinations. This measure allows to make cargo transit more efficient by reducing excess <b>transportations</b> and, as a result, non-productive runs of transit traffic. The proposed method for identifying rational location of transit terminal complexes within the existing transport network configuration takes into account the transit data. The integration of terminal-to-terminal <b>transportations</b> in the transit terminal complex, the location of which is determined on the basis of this method, will reduce excess <b>transportations</b> and total costs of operating transit traffic within the regional transport system, which, in its turn, will improve the efficiency of transit transport nodes...|$|R
