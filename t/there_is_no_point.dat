5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E
5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which Project M modifies, is a {{fighting}} game with an unconventional battle system. Players battle in arenas of varying sizes {{and levels of}} complexity, controlling characters {{with a variety of}} play styles. They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves, or with a basic attack. Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short-lived shield move. Unlike most fighting games, Brawl does not include standard health gauges, but a percentage counter; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> at which a character is automatically knocked out from the counter getting too high, but they will be knocked farther with increasing damage. Being knocked off the screen—or falling off oneself—causes a knock-out. Players may use items for offensive purposes, such as guns and swords, or for healing purposes, such as food and heart containers. The stages, characters, and items are drawn from Nintendo's video game franchises such as Mario, Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, along with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami's Metal Gear series. The victor of a match has no standard determining factor. Rather, depending on the settings, victory may be reached, for example, by being the last player alive using a stock system, or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time.|$|E

25|$|It is {{necessary}} for hemoglobin to release the oxygen that it binds; if not, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in binding it. The sigmoidal curve of hemoglobin makes it efficient in binding (taking up O2 in lungs), and efficient in unloading (unloading O2 in tissues).|$|E
25|$|Similar {{but more}} complex {{translations}} {{to and from}} algebraic logics are possible for natural deduction systems as described above and for the sequent calculus. The entailments of the latter {{can be interpreted as}} two-valued, but a more insightful interpretation is as a set, the elements of which can be understood as abstract proofs organized as the morphisms of a category. In this interpretation the cut rule of the sequent calculus corresponds to composition in the category. Boolean and Heyting algebras enter this picture as special categories having at most one morphism per homset, i.e., one proof per entailment, corresponding to the idea that existence of proofs is all that matters: any proof will do and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in distinguishing them.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{consider}} the uniform metric space M3 consisting of three points, each at unit distance from each other. The Vietoris–Rips complex of M3, for δ=1, includes a simplex for every subset of points in M3, including a triangle for M3 itself. If we embed M3 as an equilateral triangle in the Euclidean plane, then the Čech complex of the radius-1/2 balls centered at {{the points of}} M3 would contain all other simplexes of the Vietoris–Rips complex but would not contain this triangle, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> of the plane contained in all three balls. However, if M3 is instead embedded into a metric space that contains a fourth point at distance 1/2 {{from each of the}} three points of M3, the Čech complex of the radius-1/2 balls in this space would contain the triangle. Thus, the Čech complex of fixed-radius balls centered at M3 differs depending on which larger space M3 might be embedded into, while the Vietoris–Rips complex remains unchanged.|$|E

25|$|Driving {{through the}} mist, David finds his house {{destroyed}} {{and his wife}} dead. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in going on. David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not old enough to understand) rather than have them endure horrifying deaths. When David is done killing all of them, he is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived, managed to close the portal, and {{are in the process}} of exterminating the creatures. David also witnesses rescued survivors, and restoring order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued, aware now that their deaths were premature and in vain, and drops to his knees screaming.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflector}} {{affects the}} quality and directionality of the light output. A reflector is located behind or around the light source {{in such a way}} as to direct more light towards the lens or opening. Each unit has a characteristic reflector, used in conjunction with the lens (or lack thereof) to create the desired effect. An ellipsoidal reflector has a lamp set at one focus point of an ellipsoid-shaped reflector that bounces the light and focuses it at the second focus point of the ellipse. This focuses the beam of light into a tight beam. Ellipsoidal reflectors often are used for tight, focusable spots, although they can be used for floodlights, such as in scoops (see below). A parabolic reflector has a lamp set at the focus point of a parabola-shaped reflector that bounces the light in parallel beams away from the reflector. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> at which the light converges, so the light is unfocusable. Parabolic reflectors are used for lights intended to provide an unfocused wash, such as PAR cans.|$|E

500|$|Due to falling crime rates, {{fewer people}} {{felt the need}} to carry a firearm for {{protection}} after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the European migrant crisis and November 2015 Paris attacks. Gun advocacy groups argue that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is. At the same time, however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing upstanding citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as [...] "being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe", found himself unable to obtain any in the country when preparing for the 2011 Norway attacks. Similarly, a Polish terrorist obtained guns illegally in 1200km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70km from the Czech border. Also, the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.|$|E
500|$|After a {{misunderstanding}} over {{an insurance policy}} causes {{the owner of the}} inn where Twoflower and Rincewind are staying to commit arson, the pair flee the city. [...] They proceed across the disc, encountering a variety of mythical creatures, most of which lead to near-death experiences for Rincewind. [...] Fortunately for Rincewind, the Octavo spell in his head precludes him from actually dying, resulting in several comic encounters with Death. Meanwhile, a significant power struggle is occurring within the Unseen University. [...] Narrator Brian Cox explains that [...] "in the competitive world of wizardry, {{the way to the top}} is via dead men's pointy shoes... even if you have to empty them yourself". [...] The power-hungry wizard Ymper Trymon (Tim Curry) plans to become Archchancellor. Trymon assassinates several faculty members but is thwarted by the incumbent Archchancellor, Galder Weatherwax, and his superior magical knowledge of the Octavo. Trymon knows <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in deposing the Archchancellor until he learns how to control the Octavo, which is growing increasingly restless as Rincewind (and the spell in his head) moves further away from Ankh-Morpork and into greater danger.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Michael Buffer, the American boxing promoter Don King is featured prominently in [...] "Damien" [...] as Satan's promoter.

It's so random ... <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> to who we're ripping on. It's definitely nothing personal." [...] Nancy Kerrigan, the Olympic figure skater attacked on orders of fellow skater Tonya Harding at the 1994 Winter Olympics, is referred to in a pep talk Stan gives Jesus. Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan {{won the gold medal}} until Kyle reminds him she won the silver; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place. During that same pep talk, Stan tells Jesus, [...] "You know, someone once said, 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man.'" [...] Although Stan says this was a quote from Jesus himself, it was actually a line from the 1996 film, [...] [...] "Damien" [...] also includes a reference to singer Nancy Sinatra, the daughter of legendary crooner Frank Sinatra. Mr. Garrison, while discussing great singers of the baroque period, {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass".|$|E
500|$|In most kingdoms, a monarch {{succeeding}} hereditarily {{does not}} have to undergo a coronation to ascend the throne or exercise the prerogatives of their office. King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, for example, did not reign long enough to be crowned before he abdicated, yet he was unquestionably the King of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India during his brief reign. This is because in Britain, the law stipulates that in the moment one monarch dies, the new one assumes automatically and immediately the throne; thus, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> at which the throne is vacant. In France, the new king ascended the throne when the coffin of the previous monarch descended into the vault at Saint Denis Basilica, and the Duke of Uzes proclaimed [...] "Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi"! In Hungary, on the other hand, no ruler was regarded as being truly legitimate until he was physically crowned with St. Stephen's Crown, while monarchs of Belgium or Albania were not allowed to succeed or exercise any of their prerogatives until swearing a formal constitutional oath before their respective nations' parliaments. Following their election, the kings of Poland were permitted to perform a variety of political acts prior to their coronation, but were not allowed to exercise any of their judicial powers prior to being crowned.|$|E

We have about us a territory of 60,000 square miles in extent, to every point of which we are nearer than any other city, to every point of which we have better railroad connections and easier grades than any other city... We have eight lines of railroad that radiate out in all directions through it, so that shipments made here in the morning can reach any point within its borders by nightfall. We have a telephone system connecting us with almost every shipping town and shipping station within its borders. Goods may be ordered, shipped and received, in most instances, within one day. Never was a city more intimately knit to its surrounding territory than Spokane, and never was one more free from a legitimate rival in trade..." ...|$|E
