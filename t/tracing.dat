40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to improve the use of the hardware resources of the <b>trace</b> cache mechanism, reducing the implementation cost with no performance degradation. We achieve that by eliminating the replication of <b>traces</b> between the instruction cache and the <b>trace</b> cache. As we show, the <b>trace</b> cache mechanism is generating a high degree of redundancy between the <b>traces</b> stored in the <b>trace</b> cache and those built by the compiler, already present in the instruction cache. Furthermore, code reordering techniques like the software <b>trace</b> cache arrange the basic blocks in a program so that the fall-through path is the most common, effectively increasing this <b>trace</b> redundancy. We propose selective <b>trace</b> storage to avoid <b>trace</b> redundancy between the <b>trace</b> cache and the instruction cache. A simple modification of the fill unit allows the <b>trace</b> cache to store only those <b>traces</b> containing taken branches, which can nor be obtained in a single cycle from the instruction cache. Our results show that selective <b>trace</b> storage and the software <b>trace</b> cache used on a 32 entry <b>trace</b> cache (2 KB) perform as well as a 2048 entry <b>trace</b> cache (128 KB) without the enhancements.
