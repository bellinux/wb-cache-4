5|$|Constantine ignored {{those parts}} of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of {{preserving}} a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold solidus became the empire's primary currency instead. Diocletian's persecution of Christians was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Constantine would claim {{to have the same}} close relationship with the Christian God as Diocletian claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Jupiter. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s. The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} Russian {{financial}} crisis since 2014, major cuts in health spending {{have resulted in a}} decline in the quality of service of the state healthcare system. About 40% of basic medical facilities have fewer staff than they are supposed <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> <b>with</b> others being closed down. Waiting times for treatment have increased, and patients have been forced to pay for more services that were previously free.|$|E

25|$|Blair's first {{relocation}} {{was when}} he was nineteen months old. At the end of 1954, Blair's parents and their two sons moved from Paisley Terrace to Adelaide, South Australia. His father lectured in law at the University of Adelaide. It was when in Australia that Blair's sister Sarah was born. The Blairs lived in the suburb of Dulwich close to the university. The family returned to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1958. They lived for a time with Hazel's mother and stepfather (William McClay) at their home in Stepps on the outskirts of north-east Glasgow. Blair's father accepted a job as a lecturer at Durham University, and thus moved the family to Durham, England. Aged five, this marked the beginning of a long association Blair was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Durham.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> <b>with</b> its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

She said to Inside Soap: [...] "I was filming out on location recently with Ace {{and a bunch}} of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E

A planned fight scene he was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Sheeva was included in the shooting script, but it was eventually cut from the film; Raiden instead fought a pair of Reptile clones while Sheeva died after being crushed by a falling cage.

That year, Ellington and his Orchestra connected with a whole different audience in a concert with Maurice Chevalier and they also performed at the Roseland Ballroom, [...] "America's foremost ballroom". Australian-born composer Percy Grainger was an early admirer and supporter. He wrote [...] "The three greatest composers who ever lived are Bach, Delius and Duke Ellington.

2500|$|After Dussek left St. Petersburg, {{he took a}} {{position}} as music director for Prince Antoni Radziwiłł in Lithuania, where he stayed about a year. His departure from Lithuania may have been prompted by an affair he was rumored <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the Prince's wife, the Princess of Thurn und Taxis. He toured Germany {{for the next few}} years as a virtuoso performer on the piano and on the glass harmonica, eventually arriving in Paris in 1786. The German tour was a significant success for him. One review of a Berlin concert said, [...] "He obtained great distinction as a pianist, and was little less admired for his playing on the [...] harmonica ... some critics pretend to trace to his skill upon this instrument many of his specialities of style both as a pianist and composer". Another reviewer wrote, of a concert in Kassel, [...] "He entranced all listeners with a slow, harmonic, and studiously modulated prelude and chorale." [...] He may also have been in Ludwigslust in 1786, where he would have performed his Extract from an Easter Canata (C 26) for the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.|$|E
