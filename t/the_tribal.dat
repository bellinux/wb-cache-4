5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly (comitia populi tributa) of the Roman Republic was the {{democratic}} assembly of Roman citizens. <b>The</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly was organized as an Assembly, {{and not as}} a Council. During the years of the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of thirty-five Tribes which included patricians and plebeians. The Tribes gathered into <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The president of <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly was usually either a Consul (the highest ranking Roman Magistrate) or a Praetor (the second-highest ranking Roman Magistrate). <b>The</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly elected three different magistrates: Quaestors, Curule Aediles, and Military Tribunes. <b>The</b> <b>Tribal</b> Assembly also had the power to try judicial cases.|$|E

50|$|However, tribal {{religious}} {{movements that}} intended {{to safeguard the}} belief system and identity of <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> continued at a regional level like the Donyi-Polo movement, Gondi movement, Khasi religion, Sanamahi movement, Sari Dharam movement, Sarna movement etc., but a national level movement encompassing all <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> was lacking. <b>The</b> early post-Independence literate tribals did feel {{a need for a}} national level movement in order to safeguard the religious beliefs of <b>the</b> <b>tribals.</b> <b>The</b> term 'Adi-Dharam' to denote nationally the belief system of <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> was very much used among <b>the</b> literate <b>tribals</b> in <b>the</b> early post independence era as is evident from Shri Kartik Oraon's, (a <b>tribal</b> leader and <b>the</b> then State Minister of Aviation and Communication, Govt. of India) book Bees Varsh ki Kaali Raat (1970s) where he uses the word 'Adi Dharm' to denote the belief system of <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> nationally.|$|R

5|$|Sir Henry Spelman was {{the first}} to publish <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage in his first volume of Glossarium Archaiologicum (1626) and there is also a version of the text in a book written in 1691 by Thomas Gale, but no actual {{discussion}} of <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage emerged until 1848, when John Mitchell Kemble's The Saxons in England was published. In 1884, Walter de Gray Birch wrote a paper for the British Archaeological Society, in which he discussed in detail the location of each of the tribes. The term Tribal Hidage was introduced by Frederic William Maitland in 1897, in his book Domesday Book and Beyond. During the following decades, articles were published by William John Corbett (1900), Hector Munro Chadwick (1905) and John Brownbill (1912 and 1925). The most important subsequent accounts of <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage since Corbett, according to Campbell, are by Josiah Cox Russell (1947), Cyril Hart (1971), Wendy Davies and Hayo Vierck (1974) and David Dumville (1989).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. <b>The</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E

5000|$|The {{issue of}} the {{national}} religious identity of <b>the</b> <b>tribals</b> was powerfully reignited when in 2000, Ram Dayal Munda wrote a paper 'Adi-Dharam: Religious Beliefs of the Adivasis of India'.

This national identity, according to him, [...] "will strengthen their (the tribals') solidarity, which will be helpful for their security and progress".|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it}} was a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested.

Many historians are convinced that <b>the</b> <b>Tribal</b> Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E
