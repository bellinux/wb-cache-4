5|$|After Davis's death {{early in}} 1915, Lord Carnarvon {{acquired}} the concession <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the valley, and he employed Howard Carter to explore it. After a systematic search, they discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> {{and search for}} traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Teller became {{especially}} {{known for his}} advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosive in what was called Project Chariot. He was a vigorous advocate of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E

25|$|In 1577, Gurdas contributed his labour <b>to</b> <b>excavating</b> {{the pool}} at Harmandir Sahib. Twenty years later, {{he went on}} an {{expedition}} to Kartarpur and recited many of the early hymns to Emperor Akbar. Akbar was impressed by their spiritual content and was satisfied they had no anti-Muslim tone.|$|R
5|$|On May 28, 2013, the Alamogordo City Commission {{approved}} Fuel Industries, an Ottawa-based entertainment company, for {{six months}} of landfill access both to create a documentary about the legend and <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the burial site. On April 26, 2014, remnants of E.T. and other Atari games were discovered {{in the early hours}} of the excavation.|$|E
5|$|When Monk and Sharona's flight lands at Newark Liberty International Airport, Monk stalls Stefan's {{connecting}} flight to Paris by wittingly {{saying that the}} captain of the Paris flight is drunk. This allows Disher and the construction crew <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> and find the body. The Newark Police Department shows up, and Stefan and his mistress are led away in handcuffs.|$|E
5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
50|$|About 1930 a brickworks {{was set up}} east of the {{junction}} of Cain's Lane and Heathrow Road in Heathrow. Later the quarry's main purpose changed <b>to</b> <b>excavating</b> sand and gravel. The quarry company went bankrupt in 1943, and in 1944 and after the airport obliterated it and everything of Heathrow village.|$|R
25|$|The {{sector was}} {{extensively}} subdivided into informal districts, sub-sectors and quarters or quartiers, reflecting the fragmented {{nature of the}} Alpine landscape in which each valley was a distinct defensive entity. Small units were employed to patrol the border and to man individual posts ranging from observation bunkers <b>to</b> <b>excavated</b> mountaintop artillery ouvrages.|$|R
50|$|In total, {{there were}} ten {{excavations}} from May to October 1967. Talim Island, Balibago, and Rizal {{were the first}} <b>to</b> be <b>excavated.</b> It was followed by Pinagbayanan and Bagong Pook. Pila and Lumban were the last site <b>to</b> be <b>excavated.</b> Three of the four sites mentioned exposed 153 graves aging from the 12th to 15th century.|$|R
5|$|In 1964 {{the stones}} {{in the circle}} were {{disturbed}} by agricultural activity. It was then decided that the site would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J. Wainwright. The 28 stones were moved from the site using a crane to permit the archaeologists <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the area beneath them.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1931, Guatemala {{declared}} the site as a National Monument {{under the name}} of Tzaculeu. On 23 February 1946, the site was renamed as Zaculeu. The government gave a license <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> to the United Fruit Company, which immediately began archaeological excavations and related restorations of the structures under the direction of John M. Dimick. This later included re-coating a number of the buildings with white plaster, as it was known that many were originally finished that way. This has seldom been done in other restorations of Pre-Columbian buildings.|$|E
5|$|One of the wrecks was rediscovered in 1964. A private company, Platoro, Ltd., began <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the Espíritu Santo wreck in late 1967, {{which caused}} public outrage and {{the passage of}} new laws to protect wrecks on the Texan coast. The remains of San Esteban were found in 1970 and {{excavated}} in 1972–73. Many artifacts have been recovered and are held in the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. They include the world's oldest mariner's astrolabe with a confirmed date.|$|E

50|$|Olaf {{begins his}} {{recollections}} with a polar bear hunt, leading to his fame {{as a great}} hunter, <b>to</b> <b>excavating</b> his previous life's gravesite to recover the Necklace. The {{other half of the}} Necklace lies on a mummy reposing within a pharaoh's tomb in ancient Egypt. The adventure novel shows how these two separate events tie together past and present lives.|$|R
50|$|The oldest archaeological {{artifacts}} from the territory of Halych are classified to Paleolithic period 40,000 years ago. More systematic findings from a wide number of archaeological cultures dated from 5500 BC till nowadays indicate that population of local terrains was virtually perpetual for some past 7,000 years. According <b>to</b> <b>excavated</b> finds, the population of Halych became especially significant from 8-9 c. AD.|$|R
5|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> allows {{woodpeckers}} {{to obtain}} tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E
5|$|The fort was rediscovered {{by historians}} and {{excavated}} in 1996, {{and the area}} is now an archaeological site. In 1995, researchers located the ship La Belle in Matagorda Bay, with several sections of the hull remaining virtually intact. They constructed a cofferdam, {{the first to be}} used in North America <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the ship as if in dry conditions. In 2000, excavations revealed three of the original structures of the fort, as well as three graves of Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} of tomb construction {{can be seen}} with tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> KV11 but broke into the tomb of Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the tomb of Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly-excavated tomb started by his father. The tomb of Ramesses II returned to an early style, with a bent axis, {{probably due to the}} quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).|$|E
25|$|Michael and Pamela Everhart {{returned}} <b>to</b> finish <b>excavating</b> the Pteranodon, {{which had}} a roughly 17 foot wingspan.|$|R
50|$|Clogging of drains in Howrah due <b>to</b> silt <b>excavated</b> and {{discharge}} of untreated waste water have been reported.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{experiments}} {{have taken place}} to reproduce bloomery iron. [...] Clough presents an average example of experimental ironwork with the reproduction possible Roman bowl furnaces. Clough found the reproduction bowl furnaces to be inefficient by producing small amounts of poor quality iron, which, when compared <b>to</b> <b>excavated</b> findings of much larger better quality blooms of iron led {{to the conclusion that}} bowl furnaces were not used by the Romans.|$|R
5|$|Aston and Taylor {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for Time Team. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites <b>to</b> <b>excavate,</b> and gathered together a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and Carenza Lewis, artist Victor Ambrus, and historian Robin Bush. He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders {{and consume}} {{a range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E
5|$|During the 1903–04 field season, Murray {{returned}} to Egypt, and at Petrie's instruction began her investigations at the Saqqara cemetery near to Cairo, which dated {{from the period}} of the Old Kingdom. Murray did not have legal permission <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the site, and instead spent her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated during the 1860s by Auguste Mariette. She published her findings in 1905 as Saqqara Mastabas I, although would not publish translations of the inscriptions until 1937 as Saqqara Mastabas II. Both The Osireion at Abydos and Saqqara Mastabas I proved to be very influential in the Egyptological community, with Petrie recognising Murray's contribution to his own career.|$|E
500|$|The [...] long East Dam, {{constructed}} by a Kiewit-led joint venture, {{is the longest}} of the three dams. It measures [...] wide at the base and [...] wide at the top. Before embankment of the dam could begin, more than [...] of alluvium had <b>to</b> be <b>excavated</b> <b>to</b> reach a solid bedrock foundation.|$|R
50|$|Other {{than this}} temple, {{there is also}} the king’s palace, which has yet <b>to</b> be <b>excavated</b> <b>to</b> a larger extent in order to reveal more about Panauti. Nevertheless, there are many {{artifacts}} and remnants such as stone taps, bricks, water wells and coins found among some of the excavated sections of the palace.|$|R

5|$|Excavation of the {{downtown}} bus tunnel began in early 1987, and construction reached the University Street area later that year. The twin tunnel boring machines used <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> the tunnel reached University Street in October 1987, and continued north towards Westlake station. In December, Metro agreed to pay $2.4 million to real estate developer Marathon Company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station for equipment staging and storage, delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site. During excavation and construction of the University Street tunnel station, cracks and minor settling {{were found in the}} historic Seattle Tower, located nearby. The ground around the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement, and was renovated with private funding in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Bute {{asked his}} chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, <b>to</b> <b>excavate</b> and clear the castle ruins. The {{report on the}} {{investigations}} was produced by William Burges, an architect {{with an interest in}} medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s, and the two men became close collaborators. Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. On receipt of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.|$|E
5|$|Rick leads Evelyn and {{her party}} to the city, where the group {{encounters}} a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick's cowardly colleague Beni Gabor. The expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Against Ardeth's advice to leave the city, the two expeditions continue <b>to</b> <b>excavate.</b> Evelyn searches for the famous Book of the Living, a book made of pure gold. Instead of finding the book, she, Rick, and Jonathan stumble upon the statue of Anubis {{and the remains of}} Imhotep buried underneath. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs.|$|E

50|$|In a {{significantly}} different sense the term also may refer <b>to</b> <b>excavated</b> wood shavings that carpenter ants, carpenter bees and other insects with similar wood-boring habits {{kick out of}} their galleries during the tunneling process. Such material differs from the frass residues of foods, because insects that tunnel to construct such nests do not eat the wood, so the material that they discard as they tunnel has not passed through their gut.|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} by William Briwere and moved from another location. Further {{buildings}} were added in 1278 and 1284. The church was rebuilt in the 15th century and consecrated in 1445. After {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries it became a mansion house. There have been various attempts <b>to</b> <b>excavated</b> the site with decorated tiles, and other building fragments now in the Blake Museum. The only visible remains are an old door in Silver Street.|$|R
