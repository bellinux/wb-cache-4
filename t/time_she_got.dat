25|$|Late in February 1948, she {{sailed to}} Pearl Harbor and thence {{proceeded}} to the Aleutian Islands where she operated until late August 1948. In September 1948, she steamed to Tsingtao, China, making one round-trip run between Tsingtao and Yokosuka before departing the former port, bound for Oahu on 29 November 1948. The tug entered port at Pearl Harbor on 27 December 1948 and remained there until 7 January 1949 at which <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> underway {{to return to}} the west coast. She spent February and March 1949 engaged in normal west coast operations and in April 1949 returned to the Aleutians where she served until late August 1949. The tug resumed duty along the California coast upon her arrival in San Francisco on 27 August 1949. In December, she made a round-trip voyage to Pearl Harbor and back to the west coast.|$|E

At that <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> underway to participate in some amphibious exercises conducted nearby during the third week in April. Barnstable County visited Washington, D.C., in May; and, early in June, she made two short cruises to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and back to Little Creek while serving as a training platform for NROTC midshipmen. The ship remained in port during July, but, in the first part August, she took up midshipman training once more with a voyage back to Halifax, this time by way of New York City. Refresher training occupied her during the rest of August and the first week in September and then she underwent two successive availabilities in preparation for overseas assignment at the beginning of 1976. That maintenance work ended late in October, and Barnstable County resumed local training operations out of Little Creek in November. Early in December, a board of inspection and survey visited the ship, and she carried out her last underway period of the year on the 8th and the 9th in conjunction with that inspection.|$|E

500|$|Murphy and Mark Brydon {{ended their}} romantic {{relationship}} but were still contractually obligated to record another album, which became Moloko's 2003 album Statues. When she finished touring, {{she found herself}} alone and had to re-evaluate the friendships she had built. During this <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> to know Matthew Herbert, whom she had met when he remixed several of Moloko's songs. Murphy had {{wanted to work with}} him again, commenting that [...] "it felt very natural…because Matthew makes things seem quicker and easier". During the first day of recording with Herbert, he had her bring an unspecified object so that they could hit it against a microphone and record the sound it made. Herbert's approach was that for Murphy to go solo, the album should revolve around her and the sounds that surround her. They wanted to carry out recording and audio mixing in one room, so Herbert invested in a studio. There, Herbert recorded Murphy's voice without accompaniment so that she could better hear how her voice naturally sounded. On occasion, the two added instruments to a track by having her hire an instrumentalist, sometimes to play an unusual instrument such as a hammered dulcimer.|$|E

2500|$|A {{man called}} Henry Taylor took Sara Baartman to France, from around September 1814. Taylor then sold {{her to an}} animal trainer, S. Réaux, who {{exhibited}} her under more pressured conditions for fifteen months at the Palais Royal. In France she was in effect enslaved. In Paris, her exhibition became more clearly entangled with scientific racism. French scientists were curious about whether she had the elongated labia which earlier naturalists such as François Levaillant had purportedly observed in Khoisan at the Cape. French naturalists, among them Georges Cuvier, head keeper of the menagerie at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle,and founder of the discipline of comparative anatomy visited her. She {{was the subject of}} several scientific paintings at the Jardin du Roi, where she was examined in March 1815: as Saint-Hilaire and Frédéric Cuvier, a younger brother of Georges, reported, [...] "she was obliging enough to undress and to allow herself to be painted in the nude." [...] This was not literally true: although by his standards she appeared to be naked, in accordance with her own cultural norms of modesty throughout these sessions she wore a small apron-like garment which concealed her genitalia. [...] She steadfastly refused to remove this even when offered money by one of the attending scientists. In Paris, Baartman's promoters didn't need to concern themselves with slavery charges. Crais and Scully state: [...] "By the <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> to Paris, her existence was really quite miserable and extraordinarily poor. Sara was literally treated like an animal. There is some evidence to suggest that at one point a collar was placed around her neck." ...|$|E
