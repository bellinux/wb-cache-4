5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
5|$|Cain orders Nemesis {{to return}} to <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> so they can leave, but Nemesis turns on Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is finally killed {{protecting}} Alice from an explosion, {{and the rest of}} the survivors seize <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b> They throw Cain from <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> to the ground to be eaten by zombies, including the now-turned Dr. Ashford. The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast wave and forcing it to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela during the crash and is impaled on a metal pole, killing her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 25 September 2008 Pakistani troops {{fired on}} two American OH-58 Kiowa {{reconnaissance}} helicopters; U.S. ground troops, who <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> were supporting, returned fire. No one was injured {{on either side}} and <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> were undamaged. American and NATO officials asserted that <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> were flying within Afghan territory to protect an armed patrol. Pakistani officials declared that <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> were inside Pakistani territory and were fired upon by [...] "flares" [...] as a warning.|$|R
50|$|Gant’s mission proves ill-fated {{from the}} start. The C-5 cargo plane {{carrying}} <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> and their crew to their staging point, suffers a fuel-system malfunction requiring the jettisoning of <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{on a remote}} beach — nearly destroying both of them. <b>The</b> <b>helicopters</b> are made flight-ready and the mission commences, only for one of <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> to be shot down over Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. Gant narrowly avoids destruction over Afghanistan only to be captured once he reaches Baikonur and tries to extract Kedrov, falling {{into the hands of}} KGB officers who had been surveilling the turncoat engineer.|$|R

5|$|Leonard {{arrived at}} Irish Helicopters on 31 October and was {{introduced}} to the pilot of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter,</b> Captain Thompson Boyes. Boyes was instructed to fly to a field in Stradbally, in order to pick up Leonard's photographic equipment. After landing Boyes saw two armed, masked men approaching <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> from nearby trees. Boyes was held at gunpoint and told he would not be harmed if he followed instructions. Leonard left with one gunman, while the other gunman climbed aboard <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> armed with a pistol and an Armalite rifle. Boyes was instructed to fly towards Dublin following the path of railway lines and the Royal Canal, and was ordered not to register his flight path with Air Traffic Control. As <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> approached Dublin, Boyes was informed of the escape plan and instructed to land in the exercise yard at Mountjoy Prison.|$|E
5|$|Aided by Whitman—who {{has managed}} to {{negotiate}} some degree of freedom with the Solarii—Lara returns to the palace to rescue Sam as Roth commandeers a helicopter to get them out. Lara succeeds, but persuades Sam to escape by land when she sees another storm gathering as <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> approaches. As Lara tries to force <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> pilot to land, they are brought down, with Lara nearly dying. Roth revives Lara, then takes a fatal blow from Mathias meant for her.|$|E
5|$|Bågenholm's colleagues made {{an attempt}} to free her but failed. At 18:27 local time (CET), seven minutes after she {{had fallen into the}} water, they called for help on a mobile phone. Police {{lieutenant}} Bård Mikalsen received the call and put together two rescue teams; one {{at the top of the}} mountain and one at the bottom. Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King helicopter, but they told him that <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> had left to transport a sick child. Mikalsen was persistent and convinced the dispatcher to turn <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> around.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the {{department}} began using two Eurocopter AS350B3 <b>helicopters.</b> <b>The</b> <b>helicopters</b> are stationed at {{the department}}'s helipad at the Downtown Airpark. <b>The</b> <b>helicopters</b> are equipped with Forward looking infrared cameras and searchlights. When in flight, <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> use <b>the</b> FAA callsign Air-One or Air-Two to communicate with Oklahoma City Air Traffic Control. Prior to 2014, the OCPD operated a pair of MD 500E helicopters as their air-support assets.|$|R
5|$|After {{an hour on}} <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{left with}} <b>the</b> first 61 evacuees, {{including}} all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets {{on one of the}} flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|R
25|$|Landing {{and dealing}} with {{helicopters}} course, through which the soldiers learn {{how to deal with}} <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> and board them to reach their mission location, in addition to landing from <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> using ropes and firing from inside them.|$|R
5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Killed in the {{airplane}} were the pilot Steven Altman, his brother Daniel, and his nephew Douglas. <b>The</b> <b>helicopter</b> tourists were in two groups; {{the first was}} Michele Norelli and his son, Filippo Norelli. The other group was Fabio Gallazzi, his wife, Tiziana Pedroni, and his son, Giacomo Gallazzi. The pilot of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> was New Zealander Jeremy Clarke, who had logged 2,700 hours as a helicopter pilot. All recovered victims died from blunt trauma to the head, torso and extremities, according to the NYC medical examiner's office.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 2008, a Eurocopter AS350 {{crashed on}} the runway at Nuuk Airport. There were no injuries, but <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
25|$|Thirty minutes later, two gunships {{attempted}} {{to cross the}} border again at the same place. Pakistani regular and Frontier Corps troops fired warning shots into the air and away from <b>the</b> <b>helicopters,</b> causing <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> to turn back without attacking any targets in Pakistan.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>helicopters</b> first {{attacked}} <b>the</b> border post, named [...] "Volcano", {{atop the}} mountain peak. This initial attack cut all the communications {{to and from}} the post, and a Pakistan Air Force air support could not be called in time to counter the attack. Instead, Pakistani troops stationed at the nearby post named [...] "Boulder" [...] engaged <b>the</b> NATO <b>helicopters</b> with anti-aircraft guns. <b>The</b> <b>helicopters</b> soon withdrew.|$|R
25|$|Nadel's {{force was}} airlifted to <b>the</b> crest by <b>helicopters.</b> Two battalions, totalling 606 soldiers, arrived in twenty-seven sorties. <b>The</b> <b>helicopters</b> moved through <b>the</b> wadis around the Syrian {{anti-aircraft}} positions, and artillery preceded <b>the</b> <b>helicopters.</b> Syrian artillery {{from the nearby}} village Irneh shelled the landing zone and seriously wounded one Israeli. Twenty-one soldiers were also landed at the summit of Mount Hermon.|$|R
5|$|On the island, Jack and Sawyer {{meet up with}} Hurley and Locke at the Orchid station. Jack and Locke {{once more}} argue {{about the nature of}} the island; Locke implores him to lie about the island once he and the other {{survivors}} leave. At <b>the</b> <b>helicopter,</b> Kate, Sayid, and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries, except Keamy, who feigns death. In return, the Others allow Kate, Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b> Ben returns to the Orchid, where he gets in a hidden elevator with Locke.|$|E
5|$|The abductors {{refuse to}} give Foster any {{explanation}} {{as to what is}} happening.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a survey of the}} flight {{conditions}} experienced by three military helicopters engaged in simulated and actual military missions, and a commercial <b>helicopter</b> operated in <b>the</b> mountainous terrain surrounding Denver, CO, are presented. The data, obtained with NASA helicopter VGHN recorders, represent 813 flights or 359 flying hours, and are compared where applicable to previous survey results. The current survey results show that none of <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> exceeded <b>the</b> maximum design airspeed. One military helicopter, used for instrument flight training, never exceeded 70 percent of its maximum design airspeed. The rates of climb and descent utilized by <b>the</b> IFR training <b>helicopter</b> and of <b>the</b> mountain-based <b>helicopter</b> were generally narrowly distributed within all the airspeed ranges. The number of landings per hour for all four of <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 3. <b>The</b> turbine-engine <b>helicopter</b> experienced more frequent normal-acceleration increments above a threshold of +/- 0. 4 g (where g is acceleration due to gravity) than <b>the</b> mountain-based <b>helicopter,</b> but <b>the</b> mountain-based <b>helicopter</b> experienced acceleration increments of greater magnitude. Limited rotor rotational speed time histories showed that all <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> were operated at normal rotor speeds during all flight conditions...|$|R
