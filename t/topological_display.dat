Engineering of variants by changing the <b>topological</b> <b>display</b> of carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) provides tools to understand the inherent specificity of the functional pairing. We here illustrate its practical implementation {{in the case of}} human tandem-repeat-type galectin- 8 (Gal- 8). It is termed Gal- 8 (NC) due to presence of two different CRDs at the N- and C-terminal positions. Gal- 8 N exhibits exceptionally high affinity for 3 ′-sialylated/sulfated β-galactosides. This protein is turned into a new homodimer, i. e., Gal- 8 (NN), by engineering. The product maintained activity for lactose-inhibitable binding of glycans and glycoproteins. Preferential association with 3 ′-sialylated/sulfated (and 6 -sulfated) β-galactosides was seen by glycan-array analysis when compared to the wild-type protein, which also strongly bound to ABH-type epitopes. Agglutination of erythrocytes documented functional bivalency. This result substantiates the potential for comparative functional studies between the variant and natural Gal- 8 (NC) /Gal- 8 N...|$|E

The nature of the phases and their changes are clarified by the eigenvectors of the $k$-space reduced density matrix.

We study the near-field interaction of light propagating in an optical fiber with crystals of Sb 2 Te 3, a 3 D topological insulator (TI), and observe a large apparent Faraday rotation. The origin of this unexpected polarization rotation in the optical fiber is attributed to a magneto-optical Kerr effect at the TI-fiber interface. We show that the combined effects of time-reversal symmetry breaking, which arises from Zeeman coupling of the electromagnetic field with the surface electrons of the TI, and inversion symmetry breaking of optical excitations, which arises from the exponential decay of the evanescent light across the TI crystal, are central to realizing this giant polarization rotation. Our work demonstrates a facile approach for realizing large magneto-optical effects without any magnetic fields by exploiting the unique physics of light-matter interactions at TI surfaces.

In contradistinction to the Quantum Hall systems where the charge conductance of the edge modes is quantized, the spin conductance is not and it remained an open problem to find the observable whose edge current is quantized. In this paper, we define a particular observable and the edge current corresponding to this observable. We show that this current is quantized and that the quantization is given by the index of a certain Fredholm operator. This provides a new topological invariant that is shown to take same values as the Spin-Chern number previously introduced in the literature. The result gives an effective tool for the investigation of the edge channels' structure in Quantum Spin-Hall systems. Based on a reasonable assumption, we also show that the edge conducting channels are not destroyed by a random edge. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Nodal <b>topological</b> superconductors <b>display</b> {{zero-energy}} Majorana flat bands at generic edges. The flatness {{of these}} edge bands, which {{is protected by}} time-reversal and translation symmetry, gives rise to an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Therefore, even arbitrarily weak interactions lead to an instability of the flat-band edge states towards time-reversal and translation-symmetry-broken phases, which lift the ground-state degeneracy. We examine the instabilities of the flat-band edge states of d_{xy}-wave superconductors by performing a mean-field analysis in the Majorana basis of the edge states. The leading instabilities are Majorana mass terms, which correspond to coherent superpositions of particle-particle and particle-hole channels in the fermionic language. We find that attractive interactions induce three different mass terms. One is a coherent superposition of imaginary s-wave pairing and current order, and another combines a charge-density-wave and finite-momentum singlet pairing. Repulsive interactions, on the other hand, lead to ferromagnetism together with spin-triplet pairing at the edge. Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations confirm these findings and demonstrate that these instabilities occur even {{in the presence of}} strong quantum fluctuations.

According to one generalization of topological phase to non-Hermitian systems, a finite system in a non-trivial <b>topological</b> phase <b>displays</b> surface states with exponentially long life times. In this work we explore the possibility of exploiting such non-Hermitian topological phases to enhance the quantum coherence of a fiducial qubit embedded in a dissipative environment. We first show that a network of qubits interacting with lossy cavities can be represented, in a suitable super-one-particle sector, by a non-Hermitian " Hamiltonian " of the desired form. We then study, both analytically and numerically, one-dimensional geometries with up to three sites per unit cell, and up to a topological winding number $W$ = 2. For finite-size systems the number of edge modes is a complicated function of $W$ and the system size $N$. However we find that there are precisely $W$ modes localized {{at one end of}} the chain. In such topological phases the quibt's coherence lifetime is exponentially large in the system size. We verify that, for $W$ > 1, at large times, the Lindbladian evolution is approximately a non-trivial unitary.

However, none of these propositions is able to consistently explain what matter is and how matter interacts by describing at the same time electromagnetism, relativity, gravitation, quantum physics and observed elementary particles. Here it is proposed that spacetime is an isotropic Newtonian 3 D lattice, and that its topological defects, namely diverse dislocations and disclination loops, are the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter. We find, for an isotropic lattice obeying Newton laws and with specific assumptions on its elastic properties, that the macroscopic behaviour of this lattice and of its <b>topological</b> defects <b>displays</b> all known physics, unifying electromagnetism, relativity, gravitation and quantum physics, and resolving some longstanding questions of modern cosmology. Moreover, studying various possible microscopic structures of the Newton's lattice, for example assuming lattice axial symmetry, represented by a colored cubic 3 D lattice, we show that one can possibly identify a lattice structure whose topological defect loops coincide with the complex zoology of elementary particles, opening a promising field of research.

Armed with this understanding, we study the orbital magnetism of skyrmions, and demonstrate that the contribution driven by the emergent magnetic field is topological. This means that the topological contribution to the orbital moment does not change under continous deformations of the magnetic structure.

This and other generic properties led us to the remarkable conclusion that, by adjusting the gyration radius of the bodies, one can always simultaneously open a gap in the phonon spectrum, lock-in all the characteristic symmetries and generate a non-trivial topological invariant.

The autocorrelation time for the non-local topological quantities in these systems may remain finite even in the thermodynamic limit. We provide explicit expressions for the autocorrelation functions in Kitaev's model.
