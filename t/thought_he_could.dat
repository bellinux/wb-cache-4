5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Lyon <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> teach Yagan British {{ways and}} convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his {{cooperation}} and use his tribal stature {{to persuade the}} Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended dinghy and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland. The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} neurasthenia, a nervous disorder, and recommended {{long periods of}} rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest of}} his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E

5|$|Robben was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Netherlands at Euro 2012. He started in the first group stage match, a 1–0 loss to Denmark, in which he hit the post with a curled effort. In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he hopped over the advertising boards and walked the long way round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt because he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.|$|E
5|$|The Fatimid dynasty was {{succeeded by}} {{the rule of}} Saladin and his Ayyubid dynasty. Initially {{appointed}} vizier by the last Fatimid Caliph Al-'Āḍid (who incorrectly <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be easily manipulated), Saladin consolidated power in Egypt, allying that country with the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Distrusting al-Azhar for its Shi'a history, the mosque lost prestige during his rule. However, the succeeding Mamluk dynasty made restorations and additions to the mosque, overseeing a rapid expansion of its educational programs. Among the restorations was a modification of the mihrab, with the installation of a polychrome marble facing.|$|E
5|$|After his succession, Charles quarrelled {{with the}} Parliament of England, {{which sought to}} curb his royal prerogative. Charles {{believed}} in the divine right of kings and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic, generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed {{groups such as the}} English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years' War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> not divine her <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> {{not know}} what his words had done; how they had shown her in a flash what Jimmy was to her, and lighted her mind like a flame, {{revealing}} the secret hidden there. She knew now. The feeling of comradeship, the instinctive trust, the sense of dependence--they no longer perplexed her; they were signs which she could read.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is a mistake. But {{what can}} I do? I {{fear that he}} regards the rich as his enemies. He is pining for the solace of some friend to whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> talk--for some equal, with a mind educated like his own, to whose <b>thoughts</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> listen, and to whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> speak his own thoughts. But such a friend must be equal, not only in mind, but in purse; and where can he ever find such a man as that?" ...|$|R
5|$|Chapman {{was popular}} at Cambridge and enjoyed his time there. He {{took part in}} a variety of social engagements and became {{involved}} in other sports. These included fives, tennis, rugby union, golf and football. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team and might have played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have reached a high standard if motivated to do so, and golf.|$|E
5|$|In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, {{a branch}} of Bletchley Park, {{informed}} Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, Warspite and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on Royal Sovereign and her sisters and the carrier Hermes. He intended to ambush Nagumo's fleet in a night action, the only method by which he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|McKinley's good {{standing}} with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff, defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E
60|$|Will {{wished that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get {{his share of}} prize-money at once, and promised himself that his very first {{expenditure}} would be a suite of coral for the lady who had done so much for him. In no way, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> lay out money with such gratification to himself.|$|R
60|$|The {{conductor}} {{was asking}} for tickets. Bill showed his mechanically, and the conductor passed on. Then he settled down once more to his <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not think coherently yet. His walk to the station had been like a walk in a dream. He was conscious of a great, dull pain that weighed on his mind, smothering it. The trees and houses still moved past him in the same indistinguishable blur.|$|R
5000|$|Henning = Johannes Dotenberg (Knight) {{who lived}} during 1326 in the {{vicinity}} of Greiffswald. It is <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be a descendant of Johannes Older.|$|R
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E
25|$|Despite the loss, Mustain felt a {{boost in}} {{confidence}} and stopped taking his ADHD medication, Vyvanse. He <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> earn money by selling the medication illegally, and was caught and arrested on February 1, 2011. Eventually, he entered into a pre-file community service program {{in order to avoid}} a more severe sentence.|$|E
60|$|Philip <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily seize a {{large part}} of Normandy and annex it to his dominions while John was engaged in {{defending}} himself against Arthur in England.|$|R

60|$|Phonny {{ran up to}} the trap, {{and took}} hold of it. He lifted it up very cautiously. He shook {{it as well as}} <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and then listened. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hear or feel some slight motion within. He became very much excited.|$|R
25|$|Believing {{that the}} US would {{eventually}} {{prevail in the}} war against Great Britain, Lafitte <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> more easily defeat the US revenue officers than he could the British navy. He had also been told in August that American officials were planning an assault on Barataria with forces under the command of Commodore Daniel Patterson. They feared that Lafitte and his men might side with the British.|$|E
25|$|The last {{phase was}} to take place during or shortly after Phase Two, which was to extort several million dollars from the United States government. This money {{would be used to}} finance a larger plan, to travel north to Canada. Along the way, they would stop in YMCAs and orphanages {{recruiting}} other impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. Muhammad <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> act as their father figure as he did with Malvo.|$|E
25|$|He fired {{only when}} he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> destroy. Two hundred and fifty yards was the {{distance}} from which he liked best to fire. A couple of short, hard burst from there and that was usually it. He picked his targets off cleanly and decisively, swinging his sight smoothly through them as a first-class shot strokes driven partridges out of the sky. It was a fluent and calculated exercise... For Beurling the confirmed kill was the thing.|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} put her out of his <b>thoughts,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not. The memory of her {{beautiful}} face drew him with a power <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not resist. The next evening he went again to the orchard.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 April 2017, Farage {{announced}} that he wouldn't stand for Parliament in the 2017 election. He stated that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> help out Brexit better {{as a leader of}} a group in the European Parliament.|$|R
5000|$|Benjamin Riegel's {{daughter}} {{decided to}} sell her stock to Robert B. Pamplin in 1985 because she <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{take care of the}} company and town like her father did.|$|R
25|$|But {{all this}} was as yet in the future. Essex's {{military}} promenade in the west of England {{was the subject of}} immediate interest. At first successful, this general penetrated to Plymouth, whence, securely based as he <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> overrun Devon. Unfortunately for him, he was persuaded to overrun Cornwall as well. At once, the Cornishmen rose, as they had risen under Hopton, and the King was soon on the march from the Oxford region, disregarding the armed mobs under Waller and Browne.|$|E
25|$|He acted promptly. On {{the evening}} of 18 August, all the {{officers}} whom he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust received secret instructions to assemble in the great square facing the arsenal on the following morning. At ten o'clock on 19 August, Gustav mounted his horse and rode to the arsenal. On the way, his adherents joined him in little groups, as if by accident, {{so that by the}} time he reached his destination he had about 200 officers in his suite.|$|E
25|$|Howling Bells {{sought a}} {{producer}} that had experience working on electronic-sounding records. Producer and mixer, Dan Grech-Marguerat, {{who had previously}} worked with Howling Bells' manager, had listened to demos of the new tracks. The band knew of his collaborations with Radiohead and Air, and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> help develop their new sound. 9:28, b 9:41, c0:01}} He came to their rehearsal studio with handwritten notes about the new songs and expressed what he could add. This encouraged the band, and they agreed to let him produce the album.|$|E
60|$|He {{wanted to}} make de Marmont talk, {{to hear what the}} young man had to say. From it <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> learn more {{accurately}} what danger would threaten Brestalou in the event of Napoleon's successful march to Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll rescue her,' he cried, leaping at his weapons. As <b>he</b> leapt <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to please her. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> take his medicine.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} the Weed Eater trimmer came {{to him from the}} {{spinning}} nylon bristles of an automatic car wash. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> come up with a similar technique to protect the bark on trees that he was trimming around.|$|R
