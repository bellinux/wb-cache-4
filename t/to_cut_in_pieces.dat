5000|$|The three Babylonian kings {{are often}} {{mentioned}} together as forming {{a succession of}} impious and tyrannical monarchs who oppressed Israel and were therefore foredoomed to disgrace and destruction. The verse in Isaiah xiv. 22, And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant and son and grandchild, saith the Lord, is applied by these interpretations to the trio: [...] "Name" [...] to Nebuchadnezzar, [...] "remnant" [...] to Evil-merodach, [...] "son" [...] to Belshazzar, and [...] "grandchild" [...] Vashti (ib.). The command given to Abraham <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>pieces</b> three heifers (Genesis 15:9) {{as a part of}} the covenant established between him and his God, was thus elucidated by readers of Daniel as symbolizing Babylonia, which gave rise to three kings, Nebuchadnezzar, Evil-merodach, and Belshazzar, whose doom is prefigured by this act of [...] "cutting to pieces" [...] (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xliv.).|$|E
5000|$|Imagine then a fleet or a ship {{in which}} there is a captain who is taller and {{stronger}} than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. The sailors are quarreling with one another about the steering--every one is of the opinion that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will further assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>pieces</b> any one who says the contrary. They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble captain's senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their own whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people like or not--the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing? ...|$|E

The purpose of this work is to present an evolutionary metaheuristic for the two-dimension cut problem using guillotine, also it's shown how this approach can be applied to solve these types of problems, it's compared with other exact algorithms and finally it's defined an evolutionary representation which may be used with different metaheuristics...|$|R
60|$|However, this disgrace {{was fully}} {{compensated}} soon after by {{another of the}} same kind, which happened to King Stephen; for whilst {{he and his brother}} of Winchester were fortifying a nunnery at Wilton, to bridle his enemies at Salisbury, who very much harassed those parts by their frequent excursions, the Earl of Gloucester, who watched all opportunities, came unaware with a strong body of men, and set fire on the nunnery while the King himself was in it. Stephen, upon the sudden surprise of the thing, wholly lost or forgot his usual courage, and fled shamefully away, leaving his soldiers <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>pieces</b> by the Earl.|$|R

60|$|Secondly, he {{prevents}} a worse fraud, which is, {{the buying}} and selling such counterfeit money. This was a very wicked, but open trade, in former days, and may in time come to be so again: fellows went about the streets, crying 'Brass money, broken or whole;' that is to say, they would give good money for bad. It was at first pretended that they were obliged <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it <b>in</b> <b>pieces,</b> and if you insisted upon it, they would <b>cut</b> it <b>in</b> <b>pieces</b> before your face; but they as often got it without that ceremony, and so made what wicked shifts they could to get it off again, and many times did put it off for current money, after they had bought it for a trifle.|$|R

60|$|I had {{the biggest}} {{magazine}} of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I believe, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of her that I could; so every day at low water I went on board, and brought away something or other; but particularly the third time I went I brought away {{as much of the}} rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails, first and last; only that I was fain <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> them <b>in</b> <b>pieces,</b> and bring as much at a time as I could, for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.|$|R
50|$|From 1859, {{the ports}} of Nagasaki, Hakodate and Yokohama became open to foreign traders as a {{consequence}} of the Treaties. Foreigners arrived in Yokohama and Kanagawa in great numbers, giving rise to trouble with the samurai. Violence increased against the foreigners and those who dealt with them. Murders of foreigners and collaborating Japanese soon followed. On 26 August 1859, a Russian sailor was <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the streets of Yokohama. In early 1860, two Dutch captains were slaughtered, also in Yokohama. Chinese and native servants of foreigners were also killed.|$|R
50|$|In Peter's absence, {{the pilgrims}} were ambushed and <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> detail by the Turks, {{who were more}} disciplined, at the Battle of Civetot.

60|$|It {{was very}} plain what short work {{would have been}} made of such men as the Ordelaffi and the Malatesta had Cesare gone north. But Cesare was fast at the Vatican, treated by the Pope with all outward {{friendliness}} and consideration, but virtually a prisoner none the less. Julius continued to press for the surrender of the Romagna strongholds, which Remolino had promised in his master's name; but Cesare persisted obstinately to refuse, until the news reached him that Michele da Corella and della Volpe, who had gone north with seven hundred horse to support his Romagnuoli, had been <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> Tuscany by the army of Gianpaolo Baglioni.|$|R
60|$|Domitian affronted the Romans {{by wearing}} a gold crown with little {{figures of the}} gods on it. He did strange things. Once he called {{together}} all his council {{in the middle of}} the night on urgent business, and while they expected to hear of some foreign enemy on the borders, a monstrous turbot was brought in, and they were consulted whether it was <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>pieces</b> or have a dish made on purpose for it. Another time he invited a number of guests, and they found themselves in a black marble hall, with funeral couches, each man's name graven on a column like a tomb, a feast laid as at a funeral, and black boys to wait on them! This time it was only a joke; but Domitian did put so many people to death that he grew frightened lest vengeance should fall on him, and he had his halls lined with polished marble, that he might see as in a glass if any one approached him from behind. But this did not save him. His wife found that he meant to put her to death, and contrived that a party of servants should murder him, A.D. 96.|$|R
60|$|Marie, {{when the}} {{interview}} was over, walked about the room almost in dismay. It was borne in upon her by degrees that Sir Felix Carbury {{was not at all}} points quite as nice as she had thought him. Of his beauty there was no doubt; but then she could trust him for no other good quality. Why did he not come to her? Why did he not show some pluck? Why did he not tell her the truth? She had quite believed Lord Nidderdale when he said that he knew the cause that had kept Sir Felix from going to Liverpool. And she had believed him, too, when he said that it was not his business to tell her. But the reason, let it be what it might, must, if known, be prejudicial to her love. Lord Nidderdale was, she thought, not at all beautiful. He had a commonplace, rough face, with a turn-up nose, high cheek bones, no especial complexion, sandy-coloured whiskers, and bright laughing eyes,--not at all an Adonis such as her imagination had painted. But if he had only made love at first as he had attempted to do it now, she thought that she would have submitted herself <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>pieces</b> for him.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier {{depictions of}} bliauts appear <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> one <b>piece,</b> {{such as an}} example at Angers Cathedral, which is cinched at the natural waistline. The statue at Angers also shows visible lacing at the sides. Later {{examples}} of statuary such as the jambs of the Cathedral of Chartres west façade portals show the full accomplishment of the bliaut on female saints and patrons, such as the [...] "Lady With Embroidered Hem," [...] appearing on the left, beside the left portal. These later bliauts, usually shown on statues carved between the 1130s and 1160s, are termed the bliaut girone, and unlike their predecessors, were <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> two <b>pieces.</b> The bliaut girone consisted of a fitted bodice (cors) and skirt (girone), which was pleated into a low waistband and fell down in vertical folds. It was often paired with a girdle, or ceinture, which was wrapped around the stomach, emphasising the womb.|$|R
50|$|MacGachen (1844) gives a {{confused}} version {{in the second}} collection of prose and verse named the Ayrshire Wreath. The action in this version {{takes place at the}} Bridge of Annock, erroneously located over the Carmel Burn that is actually located in the Kilmaurs area. The Earls manservant is wittily named as Archie Mucledrouth and Cunninghame of Aiket is stated to have fired the fatal shot and as having been hunted down and <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> Hamilton. Many of the Earls retainers are said to have been killed, the stream running red with their blood, giving a fisherman, a maiden and some children a nasty shock.

60|$|They {{saw that}} the stair only went down three steps, and then {{it came to a}} sudden end, and all below was a dark and dismal pit, which seemed bottomless. On looking more intently, however, they could at length see a glimmer of light, and hear the {{rippling}} of the waves of the lake, at a great depth below. The guide said that {{this was one of the}} oubliettes, that is, a place where men could be destroyed secretly, and in such a manner that no one should ever know what became of them. They were conducted to this door, and directed to go down. It was dark, so that they could only see the first steps of the stair. They would suppose, however, that the stair was continued, and that it would lead them down to some room, where they were to go. So they would walk on carefully, feeling for the steps of the stair; but after the third there would be no more, and they would fall down to a great depth on ragged rocks, and be killed. To make it certain that they would be killed by the fall, there were sharp blades, like the ends of scythes, fixed in the rock, far below, <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> them <b>in</b> <b>pieces</b> as they fell.|$|R
60|$|This {{was hailed}} as a good proposal, though some were of opinion it was too gentle. However, it was agreed to, with this addition, that the culprit's capote should be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>pieces.</b> <b>In</b> order to {{accomplish}} {{the latter part of}} the ceremony with more ease, one of the men removed the capote by the simple process of ripping the back up to the neck, and slitting the sleeves with a scalping-knife. The man here showed a disposition to resist, and began to struggle, but a quiet squeeze from Warder convinced him that it was useless. He was then seized by four men, each of whom, grasping an arm or a leg, carried him down to the water's edge. They passed Mr Ravenshaw in the opening of his tent. He rose and followed them.|$|R
