5|$|The main door in {{the south}} face leads to <b>the</b> <b>Vestibule</b> or Entrance Hall. It has a floor of encaustic tiles which include depictions of the arms of Liverpool and the liver bird.|$|E
5|$|Synagogue dues were {{collected}} by the shamash (the equivalent of a sexton or beadle), who augmented his salary by working as a glazier and running a small food concession stand in <b>the</b> <b>vestibule.</b> There mourners who came to recite kaddish could purchase a piece of sponge cake and small glass of brandy for ten cents (today $0).|$|E
5|$|The ruined Temple of Baal-hamon {{was located}} {{on the top of}} Jabal al-Muntar hill which oversees the spring of Efqa. Constructed in AD 89, it {{consisted}} of a cella and a vestibule with two columns. The temple had a defensive tower attached to it; a mosaic depicting the sanctuary was excavated and it revealed that both the cella and <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> were decorated with merlons.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{subterranean}} vestibules, each {{linked with the}} platform via an escalator. During the construction of <b>the</b> <b>vestibules,</b> orders of <b>the</b> Moscow's party committee prohibited the obstruction of traffic, so American bridges had to be built over the pits of <b>the</b> future <b>vestibules.</b>|$|R

5|$|The towers are semi-circular. Their inner flanks have lobed arches as decorations, a North African motif {{introduced}} to Egypt by the Fatimids. <b>The</b> <b>vestibule</b> {{to the right}} contains a half-domed recess with elegantly carved arches at each corner. The gates were massive, weighing four tons. The gates today have two minarets, open to visitors, from which the area may be viewed. Additions were made during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, is larger than <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{congregation}} voted {{by a margin}} of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to the walls, and <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{identical}} <b>vestibules,</b> each on <b>the</b> northern {{side of the}} Leningradsky Avenue, and the architect for <b>the</b> <b>vestibules</b> was Dmitry Chechulin.|$|R

5|$|On {{each side}} on the entry of the cathedral is a stone {{crucifix}} and a holy water font. High {{on the left side}} there is a brick from the Lateran Basilica, and on the right side a jubilee 2000 medal. The crypt is accessed through the door in the right wall of <b>the</b> <b>vestibule,</b> then up to the organ matroneum and finally down through the door on the left wall. In the crypt, there is an oratory, as well as Catechism rooms and the office of the Caritas charity.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two <b>vestibules.</b> <b>The</b> north <b>vestibule</b> goes to Varshavskoye Shosse. The south was opened on 15 June 2012.|$|R

5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E
5|$|Located on Southwest Washington Street between Third and Fourth avenues in {{downtown}} Hillsboro, {{the station is}} decorated with dark red bricks. Overhead is a steep-pitched roof, with the station's floor in <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> built of concrete planks in homage to the cedar-planked roads that formerly existed in the town. Designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc., the station is {{the largest of the}} MAX stations on the westside line as it extends most of the length of the block between Third and Fourth avenues. Hillsboro Central sits on the same site of the old Oregon Electric Railway station for the Hillsboro area and has a station building that is designed to look like an old railroad station with features similar to those at a Grand Central Station type of facility.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> and the cochlea.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the cashier}} hall columns {{hold up the}} ceiling. They are made of marble blocks, the lower half being made of dark tones, {{gradually}} moving on into whiter tones. <b>The</b> station <b>vestibule</b> is lightened with luminecent lamps, put inside niches within <b>the</b> ceiling. <b>The</b> <b>vestibule's</b> area is 500 square meters, which due to the high passenger traffic, caused by the station being a transfer to another station.|$|R
50|$|The station {{contains}} two underground <b>vestibules,</b> <b>the</b> northern one opened with the station whilst the southern one was completed later and opened only on 16 May the following year. Unlike the medieval theme of <b>the</b> platforms, <b>the</b> <b>vestibules</b> aesthetics contrast with high-tech finishes {{a set of}} domed glazed skylights and lifts for the disabled.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the whole}} area of <b>the</b> vulval <b>vestibule,</b> <b>the</b> mucus {{secreted}} by those glands protects the labia from dryness and mechanical irritation.|$|R
5|$|The 50-seat coaches {{featured}} 2x2 seating, with baggage racks in <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> end {{and separate}} men's and women's restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space {{devoted to a}} kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear observation area which seated 22. The cars were air-conditioned throughout.|$|E
5|$|The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, {{specifically}} requested Pflueger in 1920 {{after they}} received financing {{for a grand}} movie palace on Castro Street. In a hurry to see the 2,000-seat project completed, the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed in <b>the</b> <b>vestibule,</b> ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>vestibule</b> and {{staircase}} {{show the}} Victorian eclectic Gothic Revivalist taste. The hammer beam roof over the staircase imitates the 15th century, the staircase window the 14th century, and <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> arches the 13th century.|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose: Improper {{assessment}} of the maxillary buccal vestibular space {{can contribute to the}} fabrication of maxillary dentures with inadequate buccal flange extensions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a significant difference existed between the anatomic dimensions of <b>the</b> buccal <b>vestibules</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding buccal flanges of maxillary complete dentures in an edentulous population. Materials and methods: The anterior, middle, and posterior depth and width of <b>the</b> maxillary buccal <b>vestibules</b> in 100 randomly selected subjects were measured with a periodontal probe. Corresponding measurements of the buccal flanges of the subjects' existing dentures were recorded. The differences between buccal vestibule widths and depths and denture flange widths and lengths were statistically compared according to site. Results: The difference in the mean depth between <b>the</b> <b>vestibules</b> and <b>the</b> flanges in the posterior area (6. 4  mm and 10. 3  mm, respectively) was approximately 38 % (P <  0. 001). The difference in the mean width between <b>the</b> <b>vestibules</b> and <b>the</b> flanges in the posterior area (3. 3  mm and 7. 9  mm, respectively) was approximately 58 % (P <  0. 001). Conclusion: The study revealed statistically significant differences between the anatomic depth and width of <b>the</b> buccal <b>vestibules</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding flange dimensions of the existing dentures...|$|R

25|$|The next {{foray into}} the {{building}} did not occur until the daylight hours. Chief Nevins had his District Engineers organize recovery parties. Except for a short segment of <b>the</b> <b>vestibule,</b> the building had mainly collapsed into the cellar and burned until the wood was consumed. What first {{appeared to be a}} great deal of rubbish in the cellar underneath <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> turned out to be largely human remains, a large mass of people which had fallen into twisted and distorted positions and then burned. These were mainly from the gallery and the stairway, which, in the original structure, had been above <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> ceiling against the south wall of the building.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> and {{reception}} rooms are life-size portraits of Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie.|$|E
25|$|An open women's gallery, {{reached by}} two small stairs from <b>the</b> <b>vestibule,</b> extends over {{the rear of}} the sanctuary. It is {{serpentine}} in shape and supported by two round wooden columns. The gallery's outside wall is faced in rectangular panels with small square blocks in each corner; the inside wall is beaded. A raised platform at the rear is built over <b>the</b> <b>vestibule.</b>|$|E
50|$|Krasnoselskaya was {{originally}} {{planned to have}} entrances at two ends, but only the western one, located at {{the northeast corner of}} Krasnoprudnaya Street and Upper Krasnoselskaya Street, was built.
