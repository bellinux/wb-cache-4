5|$|In {{addition}} to the majestic yet fairly traditional compositions by the two Strausses and Khachaturian, Kubrick used four highly modernistic compositions by György Ligeti that employ micropolyphony, the use of sustained dissonant chords <b>that</b> <b>shift</b> slowly. This technique was pioneered in Atmosphères, the only Ligeti piece heard in its entirety in the film. Ligeti admired Kubrick's film but, in {{addition to}} being irritated by Kubrick's failure to obtain permission directly from him, he was offended that his music was used in a film soundtrack shared by composers Johann Strauss II and Richard Strauss. Other music used is Ligeti's Lux Aeterna, the second movement of his Requiem and an electronically altered form of his Aventures, the last of which was also used without Ligeti's permission and is not listed in the film's credits.|$|E

25|$|No observer, either {{academic}} or independent, could have mistaken {{the direction of}} change taken by the avant-garde between 1906 and 1910.

25|$|The public {{transportation}} system began to expand beyond the trolley lines pioneered by predecessors of the Scranton Railways system. The Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, {{commonly referred to}} as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to Wilkes-Barre. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of Clarks Summit and Dalton. They could travel to Lake Winola and Montrose using the Northern Electric Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting <b>that</b> <b>shift</b> in transportation modes.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no doubt that at a certain point, Hebrew was {{displaced}} as the everyday spoken language of most Jews, and that its chief successor in the Middle East was the closely related Aramaic language, then Greek, scholarly opinions on the exact dating of <b>that</b> <b>shift</b> have changed very much. In the first half of the 20th century, most scholars followed Geiger and Dalman in thinking that Aramaic became a spoken language in the land of Israel as early as the beginning of Israel's Hellenistic Period in the 4th century BCE, and that as a corollary Hebrew ceased to function as a spoken language around the same time. Segal, Klausner, and Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view. During the latter half of the 20th century, accumulating archaeological evidence and especially linguistic analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls has disproven that view. The Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovered in 1946–1948 near Qumran revealed ancient Jewish texts overwhelmingly in Hebrew, not Aramaic.|$|E

25|$|The Penguins {{picked up}} a 4–2 win in game four, equalling their {{performance}} from the previous meeting. Detroit found themselves at an early disadvantage, as a tripping call on Niklas Kronwall gave Pittsburgh a power play just over a minute into the game. Evgeni Malkin scored with the man advantage at 2:39 to give the Penguins an early lead. The goal occurred after Chris Osgood stopped a Jordan Staal shot, then Kris Letang fired a rebound wide that {{was picked up by}} Malkin and deposited behind the outstretched goaltender. Detroit ended the first period on a relentless assault, but Marc-Andre Fleury held the fort in goal for Pittsburgh, including a sequence in which he stopped four Detroit shots seconds apart. On <b>that</b> <b>shift,</b> Fleury cancelled a Darren Helm wrap around attempt, stood up to stop Mikael Samuelsson's rebound one-timer, then stopped Dan Cleary on two more rebound tries. With 19 shots in the period, Detroit would eventually score at 18:19, after Helm forced Rob Scuderi into a turnover on a clearing attempt, then fired a wrist shot into the goal.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{soil erosion}} and {{landslides}} in its upper catchment {{have produced a}} silt yield of about 19m3/ha/year (10cuyd/acre/yr), {{one of the highest}} in the world. Of major tributaries, the Arun brings the greatest amount of coarse silt in proportion to its total sediment load. The river transports sediment down the steep gradients and narrow gorges in the mountains and foothills where the gradient is at least ten metres per km. On the plains beyond Chatra, the gradient falls below one metre per km to as little as 6cm per km as the river approaches the Ganges. Current slows and the sediment load settles {{out of the water and}} is deposited on an immense alluvial fan that has grown to an area of about 15000km2. This fan extends some 180km from its apex where it leaves the foothills, across the international border into Bihar state and on to the Ganges. The river has numerous interlacing channels <b>that</b> <b>shift</b> laterally over the fan from time to time. Without channelisation, floods spread out very widely. The record flow of 24200m3/s is equivalent to water a metre deep and more than 24km wide, flowing at one metre per second.|$|E

According to Baxter, the music in 2001 was [...] "at the forefront of Kubrick's mind" [...] when he conceived the film. During earlier screening he played music by Mendelssohn and Vaughan Williams, and Kubrick and writer Clarke had listened to Carl Orff's transcription of Carmina Burana, consisting of 13th century sacred and secular songs. Ligeti's music employed the new style of micropolyphony, which used sustained dissonant chords <b>that</b> <b>shift</b> slowly over time, a style he originated.

A number of grindcore musicians {{are committed to}} political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the far left in connection to grindcore's punk roots.

Other grindcore groups, such as Cattle Decapitation and Carcass, have expressed disgust with human behavior, animal abuse, and are, in some cases, vegetarians or vegans. Carcass' work in particular is often identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to [...] "bodily" [...] themes. Groups <b>that</b> <b>shift</b> their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and the Meat Shits, are sometimes referred to as pornogrind.
