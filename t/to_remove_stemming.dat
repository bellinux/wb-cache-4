50|$|Deferasirox is an N-substituted bis-hydroxyphenyl-triazole. It {{is capable}} of {{removing}} iron from the blood through the coordination of two molecules of the deferasirox to a single iron ion, which forms the iron chelate (Fe-deferasirox2).

This results in a stable octahedral geometry around the iron centre.

Our results demonstrate that enriched populations of donor stem cells can produce long-lasting spermatogenic colonies in testes of imma-ture and mature, nonablated mice, albeit at a lower frequency than in ablated mice. Colonization of nonablated recipient tes-tes by neonate, pup, and cryptorchid adult donor spermatogo-nial stem cells demonstrates that competition for niche begins soon after birth and that endogenous stem cells influence the degree and pattern of donor cell colonization.

In addition, major element chemical composition analysis was conducted for these same sample sets from Site 794. The result of mineral composition analysis suggests that the detrital component, which consists of such minerals as quartz, plagioclase, illite, and kaolinite plus chlorite, is diluted to various degrees by biogenic silica (opal-A) and its diagenetic equivalents (opal-CT and quartz). Smectite, on the other hand, may be a diagenetic or hydrothermal alteration product of volcanic material, although more study is necessary to confirm its origin. As a whole, vertical variation in the sediment composition is consistent with the revised lithostratigraphy and helps to characterize the redefined lithologic units quantitatively...|$|R

These results suggest that effective chemoprevention of colon cancer by NSAIDs lies in the elimination of stem cells that are inappropriately activated by oncogenic events through induction of apoptosis. ...|$|R
40|$|Two cutting {{treatments}} {{were tested}} for aspen control in two southern Wisconsin prairies: Pasque Flower Hill (PFH), a steep hillside remnant, and Greene Prairie (GP), a restored prairie on sandy soil. The treatments, applied 25 - 26 June 1984, were: (1) A single cut {{at the base}} of the stem and (2) A cut that removed about one-third of the stem, followed 20 - 24 hours later by a basal cut. In 1986, both sites were burned in early spring, the usual management procedure for these prairies. At GP, aspen stem densities at the end of the experiment were similar in the control and both cut plots and were about 145 % higher than at the start. Density increases at PFH were 171 % in the plot cut once and 188 % in the plot cut twice. In the PFH control plot, stem density at the end was 85 % that at the start, but the stems had grown large enough to prevent top kill by the prescribed bum and to shade the prairie species.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} prosthesis revision {{surgery in the}} Western world {{has led to an}} increased focus on the capacity for stem removal. We previously reported on a femoral stem implanted in goats with an approximate 15 % reduction in retention force by drilling longitudinally orientated grooves {{on the side of the}} stem. In this current study, we aimed to histologically evaluate the bony apposition towards this stem and correlate this apposition with the pullout force. Methods: We analyzed the femora of 22 goats after stem removal. All stems remained in place for 6 months, and the goats were allowed regular loading of the hip during this time. For histological evaluation, all femora were immersed in EDTA and decalcified until sufficiently soft for standard technique preparation. We evaluated bone apposition, the presence of foreign particle debris and other factors. The apposition was evaluated with a scoring system based on semi-quantitative bone apposition in four quadrants. Kappa statistics were calculated for the score. We correlated the retention force with the amount of bone apposition. Results: The stem drilling was the only significant factor influencing the retention force (p = 0. 020). The bone apposition Kappa score comparing poor and good apposition scores was fair (κ = 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 00 – 0. 88). Signs of foreign body reaction were noted in 5 of 22 goats. Conclusions: Based on the current findings in an experimental goat model, it appears that the effect of drilling tissue/bone out of the longitudinal grooves has a more significant impact on the retention force required <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>stem</b> than the amount of bone apposition outside the stem grooves. This observation may be further explored in the research of stem designs that are potentially easier <b>to</b> <b>remove.</b> </p...|$|R

30|$|Our {{results have}} direct {{management}} applications. Land managers often have specific goals for prescribed fires. For instance, many management prescriptions in eastern mixed-oak forests focus on reducing {{the density of}} smaller red maple stems to encourage oak regeneration. Prescribed fires {{can be used as}} a tool <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> smaller, undesired <b>stems</b> from a forest, but the impact of a fire on stems will depend on the maximum temperature immediately adjacent to each stem. Bova and Dickinson (2005) found that stem kill of red maple and Chestnut oak (Q. prinus) was primarily a function of fire behavior: temperature, length of exposure to flames, and heat flux over time. By combining their models with our data, a land manager could determine the fuel load and fuel moisture necessary to achieve specific, mortality-inducing temperatures during a burn. Inversely, a manager can predict the level of stem mortality to expect depending on the fuel load and fuel moisture conditions present prior to a prescribed fire. The results of those predictions could be used as a guideline for manipulating the fuels present in a forest in order to accomplish the desired management outcome. Fuel treatments could be conducted at a larger scale (i.e., at stand level) or at a smaller scale (i.e., surrounding individual ‘target’ trees).|$|R

40|$|In many regions, alien {{conifers}} {{have spread}} widely at lower elevations and are increasingly found colonizing alpine areas. Although studies have addressed conifer invasions at low elevations, {{little is known}} about the rates and constraints on spread into higher elevations. Here, we assess the relative importance of climate and the availability of regeneration microsites on the establishment of the alien species Pinus contorta into a high elevation site in New Zealand. Spread has occurred from two stands planted at the elevation of the native treeline (1347 – 1388 masl) in the 1960 s. Most stems established between 1350 and 1450 masl and P. contorta individuals were found up to 270 m above the original plantings. Although the population has increased by 180 % in the last 20 years, population growth rate has been declining. Furthermore, comparisons with studies from other mountain ranges around the world and at low elevations in New Zealand suggest this is a relatively limited spread. Our results suggest that climate variation did not have a significant effect on establishment patterns, as opposed to availability of regeneration microsites. Soil and alpine mat microsites favoured establishment of P. contorta and, although these microsites did not appear to be saturated, microsite availability may be an important limiting factor for the spread of P. contorta. Thus management strategies should focus on preventing spread in addition <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> already established <b>stems...</b>|$|R

Previously, we developed a recombinant lectin-toxin fusion protein of the hPSC-specific lectin rBC 2 LCN, which has a 23 kDa catalytic domain (domain III) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (rBC 2 LCN-PE 23). This fusion protein could selectively eliminate hPSCs following its addition to the cell culture medium. Here we conjugated rBC 2 LCN lectin with a 38 kDa domain of exotoxin A containing domains Ib and II in addition to domain III (PE 38). The developed rBC 2 LCN-PE 38 fusion protein could eliminate 50 % of 201 B 7 hPSCs at a concentration of 0. 003 μg/mL (24 h incubation), representing an approximately 556 -fold higher activity than rBC 2 LCN-PE 23. Little or no effect on human fibroblasts, human mesenchymal stem cells, and hiPSC-derived hepatocytes was observed at concentrations lower than 1 μg/mL. Finally, we demonstrate that rBC 2 LCN-PE 38 selectively eliminates hiPSCs from a mixed culture of hiPSCs and hiPSC-derived hepatocytes. Since rBC 2 LCN-PE 38 can be prepared from soluble fractions of E. coli culture at a yield of 9 mg/L, rBC 2 LCN-PE 38 represents a practical reagent <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> human pluripotent <b>stem</b> cells residing in cultured cells destined for transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Cost, {{performance}} and availability considerations are forcing {{even the most}} conservative high-integrity embedded real-time systems industry to migrate from simple hardware processors to ones equipped with caches and other acceleration features. This migration disrupts the practices and solutions that industry had developed and consolidated {{over the years to}} perform timing analysis. Industry that are confident with the efficiency/effectiveness of their verification and validation processes for old-generation processors, do not have sufficient insight on the effects of the migration to cache-equipped processors. Caches are perceived as an additional source of complexity, which has potential for shattering the guarantees of cost- and schedule-constrained qualification of their systems. The current industrial approach to timing analysis is ill-equipped to cope with the variability incurred by caches. Conversely, the application of advanced WCET analysis techniques on real-world industrial software, developed without analysability in mind, is hardly feasible. We propose a development approach aimed at minimising the cache jitters, as well as at enabling the application of advanced WCET analysis techniques to industrial systems. Our approach builds on:(i) identification of those software constructs that may impede or complicate timing analysis in industrial-scale systems; (ii) elaboration of practical means, under the model-driven engineering (MDE) paradigm, to enforce the automated generation of software that is analyzable by construction; (iii) implementation of a layout optimisation method <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> cache jitters <b>stemming</b> from the software layout in memory, with the intent of facilitating incremental software development, which is of high strategic interest to industry. The integration of those constituents in a structured approach to timing analysis achieves two interesting properties: the resulting software is analysable from the earliest releases onwards - as opposed to becoming so only when the system is final - and more easily amenable to advanced timing analysis by construction, regardless of the system scale and complexity...|$|R
