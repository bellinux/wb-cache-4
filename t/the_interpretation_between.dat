40|$|Abstract. The main {{question}} {{addressed in this}} article is how to explain the differences in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> short and long forms of past passive participles in predicative positions in Russian. The main observation is that short form participles in predicative position can yeild either an eventive or a stative passive interpretation, whereas long forms can only be interpreted statively. Apart from this, long and short participles exhibit a number of empirical differences, such as availiability of un-prefixation, various modifiers, etc. This paper proposes a formal compositional analysis of participle formation which involves two distinct operators in the derivation of long and short forms. An adjectivizing head A derives long participles and existentially binds an event variable of the underlying verb, whereas a participial head Prt derives short participles and existentially binds an external argument of the input structure. The proposed analysis accounts for the observed empirical differences between long and short past passive participles in Russian...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} {{experimental}} and theoretical literature well-established nonclassicality criteria {{from the field}} of quantum optics have been directly applied to the case of excitations in matter-waves. Among these are violations of Cauchy–Schwarz inequalities, Glauber–Sudarshan P-nonclassicality, subPoissonian number-difference squeezing (also known as the two-mode variance) and the criterion of nonseparability. We review the strong connection of these criteria and their meaning in quantum optics, and point out differences in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> light and matter waves. We then calculate observables for a homogeneous Bose–Einstein condensate undergoing an arbitrary modulation in the interaction parameter at finite initial temperature, within both the quantum theory as well as a classical reference.

Performing both techniques {{at the same time}} increases their strength considerably. The proof of concept of this method is demonstrated on a CoO/Co bilayer exchange bias system. Although information on the same phenomena, such as the coercivity or the reversal mechanism, can be separately obtained from either of these techniques, the simultaneous application optimizes the consistency between both. In this way, possible differences in experimental conditions, such as applied magnetic field amplitude and orientation, sample temperature, magnetic history, etc., can be ruled out. Consequently, only differences in the fundamental sensitivities of the techniques can cause discrepancies in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> the two. The almost instantaneous information obtained from AMR can be used to reveal time-dependent effects during the PNR acquisition.

30|$|Although {{the present}} study {{provides}} novel results, {{there are a few}} limitations worthy of discussion. First, in Study 2, computed tomography and ultrasound were not performed in the asymptomatic control group. Therefore, it is unknown if the control group had silent DVT or PE. In line with this limitation, data extraction and analysis were limited to perioperative outcomes and it is unknown if any of the controls developed VTE following discharge. Second, Study 1 consisted of a small sample size; however, this was expected when considering the infrequency of a VTE. Third, in Study 2, 39  % of the subjects underwent UKA and the delineation of performing UKA was determined by a single orthopedic surgeon with a predefined standard of care screening protocol. This approach strengthens <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> patients with contrasting knee abnormalities, but it constrains the broad application of these findings to other studies conducted in patients who underwent TKA who could have been candidates for UKA. Finally, although the NLR difference between UKA and TKA groups is likely the result of the surgical procedures, it would be remiss to ignore the underlying pathological differences between groups prior to arthroplasty. Future research is also needed to identify if the type of prosthesis, as well as different types of anticoagulant medications, impact the assessment of the NLR on VTE following knee arthroplasty.|$|E
40|$|Goal-Oriented Modelling Languages {{such as the}} Goal Requirements Language (GRL) {{have been}} used to reason about Design Patterns. However, the GRL is a general purpose {{modelling}} language that does not support concepts bespoke to the pattern domain. This thesis has investigated how advanced programming language techniques, namely Dependent Types and Domain Specific Languages, can be used to enhance the design and construction of Domain Specific Modelling languages (DSMLs), and apply the results to Design Pattern Engineering. This thesis presents Sif, a DSML for reasoning about design patterns as goal-oriented requirements problems. Sif presents modellers with a modelling language tailored to the pattern domain but leverages the GRL for realisation of the modelling constructs. Dependent types have influenced the design and implementation of Sif to provide correctness guarantees, and have {{led to the development of}} NovoGRL a novel extension of the GRL. A technique for DSML implementation called Types as (Meta) Modellers was developed in which <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> a DSML and its host language is implemented directly within the type-system of the DSML. This provides correctness guarantees of DSML model instances during model construction. Models can only be constructed if and only if the DSML’s type-system can build a valid representation of the model in the host language. This thesis also investigated design pattern evaluation, developing PREMES an evaluation framework that uses tailorable testing techniques to provide demonstrable reporting on pattern quality. Linking PREMES with Sif are: Freyja - an active pattern document schema in which Sif models are embedded within pattern documents; and Frigg - a tool for interacting with pattern documents. The proof-of-concept tools in this thesis demonstrate: machine enhanced interactions with design patterns; reproducible automation in the PREMES framework; and machine checking of pattern documents as Sif models. With the tooling and techniques presented, design pattern engineering can become a more rigorous, demonstrable, and machine checkable process...|$|E

Even though numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have had great improvements in the last decade, some severe cyclogenesis fail to be forecasted, especially in data-sparse regions. For meteorologists on duty {{it is important to}} use all available information to make the best possible forecast. Potential vorticity (PV) field can be superimposed onto a water vapour (WV) image to find mismatches, or similarities, between the output coming from the NWP model and the reality. Comparison between pseudo water vapour (PWV) images and WV images can also be used for the same purpose. This thesis investigates four selected low pressure developments during autumn 2009 and spring 2010, with emphasis on comparison between PV fields and WV images, or between WV images and PWV images. If deviations were found in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> these fields, an attempt to improve the initial state of the weather forecast was made with PV modifications. In one of these cases there was mismatch between the PV field in the upper troposphere and the WV image, and also between the PWV image and the WV image. In this case PV modification was done, and a new initial height field was obtained by PV inversion. The new modified height field was compared with the ensemble members from NORLAMEPS (Norwegian Limited Area Model Ensemble Prediction System). The ensemble members which where similar to the new modified initial field were chosen. 54 % of these members gave a better prognosis of the low pressure system than the original forecast, in comparison to 17. 5 % before using this method.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{parametric}} excitations of a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate(BEC) at finite temperature obtained from modulating the interaction strength. In Bogoliubov theory, a result connecting the real {{part of the}} diagonal Bogoliubov coefficient and instability, i. e. exponential growth of excitations, is obtained for general periodic modulations. Consequently, an analytic solution for an arbitrary square wave modulation is derived that can be studied to understand similar drivings like the sinusoidal case. This adds to previous works studying only the case for small driving amplitudes. In the recent experimental and theoretical literature well-established nonclassicality criteria {{from the field of}} quantum optics have been directly applied to the case of excitations in matter-waves like those studied here. Among these are violations of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities, Glauber-Sudarshan P-nonclassicality, sub-Poissonian number difference squeezing (also known as the two-mode variance) and the criterion of nonseparability. We review the strong connection of these criteria and their meaning in quantum optics, and point out differences in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> light and matter waves. By proposing a classical theory of a thermal BEC that gives the same predictions as the quantum theory in the high temperature limit, and using it as a reference, we can isolate real quantum effects like spontaneous emission caused by quantum noise. We conclude that to date in experiments relevant for this scenario nonclassical effects have not conclusively been observed and conjecture that additional, noncommuting, observables have to be measured to this end. Moreover this has important implications for proposed analog gravity models where the observation of nonclassical effects is a major goal. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we present simulational methods with focus on the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA).

In the NEIO study a standard LA/AIDS demand system was used to estimate elasticities evaluating seven simulated mergers of ice cream manufactures in San Antonio in 1999. Unlike previously published NEIO work, {{it is the first}} to use crosssectional data to address the issue associated with inventory effects. Using the method developed by Capps, Church and Love, none of the simulated price effects associated with the mergers was statistically different from zero at the 5 % confidence level. In 1995 Nerlove proposed a quantity-dependent hedonic model as a viable alternative to the conventional price-dependent hedonic model as a means to ascertain consumer willingness to pay for the characteristics of a given good. We revisited Nerlove?s work validating his model using transactional data indigenous to the HSD. Hedonic models, both price-dependent and quantity-dependent, were estimated for the characteristics of fat content, container type, and brand designation for the container sizes of gallon, half- gallon, and quart. A rigorous explanation of <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> the estimates derived from the two hedonic models was discussed. Using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), a matrix of own-price, crossprice, and expenditure elasticities was estimated involving various container sizes of white milk, flavored milk, carbonated soft drinks, bottled water, and fruit juices, using a cross-section of the 1999 HSD. We described price imputations and the handling of censored observations to develop the respective elasticities. These elasticities provided information about intra-product relationships (same product but different sizes), intrasize relationships (different products same container size), and inter-product relationships (different products and different sizes).

The main objective of this thesis is to study geological structure and depositional environment of Samba field using 3 -D seismic data, well log and core data. For this purpose, software of Epos application by Paradigm has been used. The samba field has two reservoirs Vemelha and Mesa with approximately 375 and 123 ft thickness respectively. For structural interpretation an area of 123, 6 km 2 was interpreted using section by paradigm software. The interpretation was conducted using 900 traces and 1000 lines, resulting in a grid which was used to generate structural maps. Structurally, the Samba field is a domo structure bounded SW by major big fault. The core description was used to identify the lithologies present in the field. In this context, 434 ft of core were described both from Vermelha and Mesa reservoirs. Three main facies were recognized from Vermelha formation named by A, B, and C and also three main facies were recognized in Mesa formation taking the designation D, E and F. Six wells were used for well log interpretation. The well logs selected to the present study were: gamma ray, resistivity and neutron-density combination. The key approach {{of this study was}} to develop facies models by integrating data from the core description and well logs interpretation. In fact, as it is well known, <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> well logs and core description data is helpful to determine the depositional environments.

The facies interpretation was a fundamental tool used to confirm that Vermelha formation was deposited in a quiet and the same time agited energy environment, and Mesa formation was deposited in a shelf margin settings. </p...|$|E

Navorsing deur Schlemmer (2010) toon aan dat taalverskuiwing na Engels in ’n redelik groot mate by bruin Afrikaanssprekendes en in ’n geringer mate by wit Afrikaanssprekendes plaasvind. Ook is daar ’n groot toename in taalvermenging onder veral wit Afrikaanssprekendes, wat moontlik ’n gevaarteken vir Afrikaans is. In hierdie artikel word die faktore en tendense beskryf wat gelei het tot funksie- en statusverlies vir Afrikaans. Ook faktore wat taalverskuiwing bevorder en die verswakking van kragte wat taalverskuiwing kan teëwerk, word onder die loep geneem. Tendense en faktore wat destruktief is vir die voortbestaan van die taal, is globalisering, die staat se transformasiemaatreëls (soos regstellende aksie en verteenwoordigendheid), die owerheid se onverskillige houding teenoor inheemse tale, die disintegrasie van Afrikaner-nasionalisme, die negatiewe gevolge van ’n onverwerkte verlede en demografiese marginalisering. Daar is egter ook konstruktiewe faktore en tendense wat waarskynlik verhoed dat taalverskuiwing groter afmetings aanneem. Dit is die lewenskragtigheid en aantrekkingskrag van die Afrikaanse kultuur, die gehalte van Afrikaanse skole, die ontluikende verwerking van die verlede deur Afrikaners en optredes van die burgerlike samelewing, wat ’n mate van aktivisme en skepping van selfhelpinstellings insluit. Ook is daar obstruktiewe tendense wat positief of negatief kan ontwikkel, soos pogings om taalvermenging teen te gaan, die ontwikkeling van nuwe tegnologie en pogings om betrekkinge tussen wit en bruin Afrikaanssprekendes te verbeter. Taalhandhawing is daarop gerig om positiewe tendense positief te hou en obstruktiewe tendense in ’n positiewe rigting te laat ontwikkel, sodat die destruktiewe tendense en faktore gestuit of selfs omgekeer kan word. Ten slotte word twee moontlikhede vir die toekoms geskets. Die een kom neer op ’n voortsetting van ’n passiewe houding teenoor destruktiewe tendense en prosesse en die ander op die aanvaarding van verantwoordelikheid vir die behoud van die taal, wat aktivisme en selfhelpinstellings insluit waar die houding van die owerheid dit noodsaak. Language {{shift and}} {{language}} maintenance in the Afrikaans community: trends and perspectives {{for the future}} Research conducted by Schlemmer (2010) indicated that a significant language shift towards English is taking place among Afrikaans-speaking coloured people, {{and to a lesser}} extent among white Afrikaners. In terms of percentages, white Afrikaans-speaking adults increased from 57, 1 percent in 1993 to 57, 6 percent in 2008, while coloured Afrikaans speakers declined from 83, 4 percent in 1993 to 77, 3 percent in 2008. The moderate growth in the number of whites using Afrikaans as their mother tongue conceals a worrying trend of language shift. Among coloured adults the percentage of Afrikaans speakers decreased markedly due to language shift. Yet previous studies indicated that the coloured Afrikaans-speaking demographic has enjoyed steady growth, especially outside the Cape Peninsula. This could indicate the emergence of regional polarisation, resulting in localised language shift toward English in the Cape Town metropolitan area. Surveys also indicate the proliferation of English as an additional language. Whereas in 2003 only 30, 1 percent of white Afrikaans households used English, its usage increased to 50, 4 percent in 2008. The corresponding figures for coloured households indicate that English was an additional language in 36, 9 percent of households in 2003, which grew to 45, 4 percent in 2008. Coloured Afrikaans speakers have traditionally mixed their mother tongue with English, but (as the above figures demonstrate) in five years mixed language use among Afrikaans-speaking whites surpassed that of coloureds. The extent of language mixture varies: from a sporadic English word, up to whole sentences could be inserted. Schlemmer posits that Afrikaans speakers are returning to a situation similar to that of a century ago, when many Afrikaners utilised Dutch or English for the purposes of formal or technical communication (sometimes even in love letters). He suggests that this should serve as a warning sign regarding the Afrikaans language. This article describes the factors and trends leading to the loss of status and function of the Afrikaans language; factors which promote language shift; and the weakening of forces that oppose language shift. Trends and factors which are seen as destructive toward the continued existence of the language include globalisation, the parameters of transformation implemented by the state, such as affirmative action, the authorities’ reckless attitude towards indigenous languages, the disintegration of Afrikaner nationalism, demographic marginalisation, and the negative consequences of an unrealised peace. Many whites still harbour feelings of guilt about apartheid, while others have lost confidence in the future due to a lack of self-determination. Similarly, coloureds have not shaken off the painful memories of life under apartheid. The authors demonstrate the destructive consequences of transformation for the Afrikaans language, citing Malan (2010 a: 427) : “If transformation has developed into the master concept of our post- 1994 public order, representivity is the principal instrument for achieving transformation. ” Many preeminent commentators suggest that legal and political representivity play a destructive role. Even though according to the Constitution representivity is applicable only to judges and civil servants, its application has been extended to civil society, the corporate sector, non-profit organisations and NGOs. The authors further indicate how transformation has undermined Afrikaans as a language of practical communication in broadcasting, legal practice, at universities and in schools. Controversially, education departments have changed language policies in Afrikaans schools; decisions which have been implemented at great cost of time and resources. Such policy changes were subsequently contested in high-profile court cases such as those of Middelburg, Mikro and Ermelo. One of the multitude of problems that has emerged in legal practice has been <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> English and Afrikaans in court cases. Whereas the courts have traditionally been effective at interpreting between English or Afrikaans and African languages, they are proving to be largely inept at interpreting between English and Afrikaans. Interpretation between these two languages is often unavailable, or of such poor quality that Afrikaans witnesses and accused often choose to testify in English, arguably to their detriment. With regard to demographics the authors point to the consequences of unequal growth in the composition of the South African population. On the one hand, large-scale emigration by white Afrikaans speakers has accentuated the problems of an existing low birth rate, which is now below the replacement rate (by comparison, the Afrikaans-speaking coloured demographic has only recently reached the replacement birth rate). In contrast, the black population exhibits a high birth rate and an influx of immigrants from the rest of Africa. However, there are also several constructive trends and factors which have prevented the process of language shift from attaining greater momentum. These are the quality of Afrikaans schools, the attempts of Afrikaners to come to grips with the past, and the activities of civil society, which include the measures of activism and the establishment of self-help initiatives. The most significant constructive trend has proved to be the vitality and allure of the Afrikaans culture. Contributing to this is the scope and variety of Afrikaans literature, the various printed and electronic media publications, and the expanding activities of the new media, for example online journals such as LitNet. The growing number of Afrikaans arts and music festivals have also become popular attractions. Afrikaans culture is blossoming – one aspect which cannot be directly controlled by the ANC. However, areas where the state is predominant pose a difficult challenge: the SABC has drastically curtailed Afrikaans television since 1994 (while it flourishes through private broadcasters such as kykNET). Obstructive trends have also been identified which have the potential to develop either positively or negatively, such as attempts to consciously counter language-mixing, the development of new technologies, and attempts to foster a closer relationship between coloured and white Afrikaans speakers. The preeminent now deceased Afrikaans linguist Fritz Ponelis suggested that it is futile to supplant standard Afrikaans with a hybrid or mixed language. In his opinion, such a language would be unable to stand its ground against the long-term encroachment of English. Regarding cooperation between the white and coloured Afrikaans communities Giliomee (2010) differentiated between two groups of coloured Afrikaans speakers. The educated working and middle classes exhibit an enthusiasm for Afrikaans and for initiatives promoting Afrikaans, as is evident in the successes of the ACVV, Kindersorg and the Stigting vir die Bemagtiging in Afrikaans. However, a different picture emerges among the coloured “elite”. This group still maintains sensitive memories of apartheid, resulting in their rejection of Afrikaans and the subsequent adoption of English as a language of mobility and aspiration. Giliomee (2010) notes that many members of the coloured elite occupying senior positions in the civil service, university management and large companies tend to be strongly progressive and individualistic, resulting in a close association with English and the subsequent values and worldview the language promotes. Such individuals generally support the government’s pursuance of race-based transformation and its policy of English as the language of access in society. In 2006, during an ATKV conference, Neville Alexander pointed out that it is still too early to speak of an Afrikaans language community. For now, the focus should be on the shared interests of Afrikaans speakers, of which effective education and tuition in Afrikaans is the most important. The authors expect that the language policy and practices of the authorities will remain unchanged, and that the Afrikaans community will have to reckon with continued aloofness, animosity and recklessness from government. Therefore taking ownership and responsibility is essential for initiatives and institutions which aim to promote Afrikaans as a language of communication, education and job creation...|$|E

This study aimed to assess the rate of agreement in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of CCTs <b>between</b> neurosurgeons and a radiologist in an emergency department. Method 227 CCT were independently analyzed by two neurosurgeons (NS 1 and NS 2) and a radiologist (RAD). The level of agreement in interpreting the examination was studied. Results The Kappa values obtained between NS 1 and NS 2 and RAD were considered nearly perfect and substantial agreement. The highest levels of agreement when evaluating abnormalities were observed {{in the identification of}} tumors, hydrocephalus and intracranial hematomas. The worst levels of agreement were observed for leukoaraiosis and reduced brain volume. Conclusions For diseases in which the emergency room procedure must be determined, agreement in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of CCTs <b>between</b> <b>the</b> radiologist and neurosurgeons was satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|Four {{models of}} energy {{decoherence}} are discussed {{from the common}} perspective of intrinsic time-uncertainty. The four authors [...] Milburn, Adler, Penrose, and myself [...] have four different approaches. The present work concentrates on their common divisors {{at the level of}} the proposed equations rather than at the level of <b>the</b> <b>interpretations.</b> General relationships <b>between</b> time-uncertainty and energy-decoherence are presented in both global and local sense. Global and local master equations are derived. (The local concept is favored. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} the attempted {{change to the}} image of an established brand by studying the semiotics within the brand’s historical advertising campaigns. The use of semiotics to study <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of messages is discussed, and <b>the</b> link <b>between</b> <b>interpretation</b> of messages and advertising effectiveness in changing brand image is explored. The authors deconstruct advertisements of a brand to provide a model containing opposing dialectics that may aid managers by highlighting alternative symbolic messages contained in advertisements. Once identified, these alternative symbolic messages may be used to help change brand image and influence advertising effectiveness...|$|R
