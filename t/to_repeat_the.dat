5|$|During the 2012 off-season, Zach Parise {{signed a}} 13-year, $98million {{contract}} with the Minnesota Wild, leaving the Devils after one season as team captain. The Devils entered the lockout-shortened season with Bryce Salvador as their new captain. However, the Devils failed <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> performance of the prior year, finishing 19–19–10 in 48 games and missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 Lieutenant Kitchener, of the Palestine Exploration Fund survey team, {{reported}} uncovering an Arabic inscription {{buried in}} {{the wall of the}} village mosque recording its building and dedication. He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea. He noted that they would probably have <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> payment.|$|E

5|$|Woman of the Year was {{followed}} by an adaptation of John Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat (1942) which met with a tepid response. MGM did not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> teaming of Tracy and Hepburn and cast them in the dark mystery Keeper of the Flame (1942). Despite a weak critical reception the film was a popular success, outgrossing its predecessor and confirming {{the strength of the}} partnership.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), {{the story of a}} girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he did not}} win {{any major}} honours as a player, as a manager Chapman won a Southern League title in 1908–09 with Northampton Town, four Football League titles (1923–24 and 1924–25 with Huddersfield Town, 1930–31 and 1932–33 with Arsenal) and two FA Cups (1922–23 with Huddersfield Town, 1929–30 with Arsenal). After his death the team he had built at Arsenal, under his successors Joe Shaw and George Allison, {{went on to win}} the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles, emulating his Huddersfield Town team by {{completing}} a hat-trick. No team was <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> feat until Liverpool between 1982 and 1984. Chapman was honorary president of Scottish amateur football club Chirnside United until his death in 1934.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by the film's {{success and}} wide-reaching popularity, Saran remade it in Telugu as Gemeni. It {{is the only}} film Saran made in a {{language}} other than Tamil. The remake starred Venkatesh and Namitha in the lead roles, while Kalabhavan Mani and Murali reprised their roles from the Tamil version. Most of the crew members were retained. Posani Krishna Murali translated the dialogues to Telugu. The soundtrack was composed by R. P. Patnaik, who reused most of the tunes from the original film. Released in October 2002, the film received lukewarm response and failed <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> success of the original. In 2013, a Kannada remake {{was reported to have}} been planned with Upendra in the lead, but he dismissed the reports as rumours.|$|E
5|$|English {{television}} cook Delia Smith and {{her husband}} Michael Wynn-Jones took over the majority of Norwich City's shares from Watling in 1996, and Mike Walker was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> success achieved during his first spell and was sacked two seasons later with Norwich mid-table in the First Division. His successor Bruce Rioch lasted two seasons and departed {{in the summer of}} 2000, with promotion yet to be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Gary Megson was {{appointed}} Norwich manager {{on a temporary}} basis {{for the second time}} in eight months: he had also briefly filled this role after Deehan's departure. Megson remained in charge until the end of the 1995–96 season before leaving the club. Mike Walker, who had struggled at Everton, was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> success achieved during his first spell and was sacked in the 1997–98 season with Norwich mid-table in the First Division.|$|E
50|$|He was {{frequently}} cast on variety {{shows such as}} “Music Album (TV series)” and there were several appearances on Elwood Glover's Luncheon Date during the 1970s. In 1979 he undertook the title role of Dodi Robb and Pat Patterson’s “The Popcorn Man” in a CBC children’s music special. This led <b>to</b> <b>repeating</b> <b>the</b> role on stage.|$|R

5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 the centenary of {{the branch}} saw a revival of {{interest}} in the line. Over the weekends of 1–2 and 8–9 July special services were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR electric locomotive. The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{attended}} the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, and was forced <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> year.|$|E

5000|$|... "Beachball" [...] was {{notable for}} topping the club charts in many {{countries}} during its time of release. Like the majority of dance releases, the track has been remixed several times but none have come close <b>to</b> <b>repeating</b> <b>the</b> success of the original version. A cover version by Burnette was released at the same time, leading to two versions competing for chart position.|$|R
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E

Beginning at a central point in an {{expansive}} landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is {{then returned to}} the central point <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.|$|E
5|$|The first Hugo Awards were {{presented}} at the 11th Worldcon in Philadelphia in 1953, which awarded Hugos in seven categories. The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one-off event, though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them. At the time, Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as independent events and had no oversight between years. Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> awards, and no set rules for how to do so.|$|E

As soon as one had evacuated all wounded to the rear, they moved ahead {{of the other two}} divisional receiving stations <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> process. However, from the beginning there were problems evacuating casualties caused by the lack of linking infrastructure, one receiving station lost all its transport, and the light motor ambulances of another disappeared. The greatest difficulty were of communication and traveling including mechanical breakdowns on the rough roads and tracks which quickly became impassable for motor traffic.|$|E
5|$|They {{performed}} the custom at Christmas time, and usually on Christmas Eve. The team would arrive at people's houses {{where they would}} sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with their broom while chasing any girls present. Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols at this point. Upon being presented with payment, the team would leave <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> process at another house.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together {{to think about what}} is to become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
