25|$|In recent years, {{the talent}} of singing has become competitive. Currently, {{there are several}} {{television}} shows that showcase these talents. American Idol {{was one of the}} prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, {{it was one of the}} first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa launched by Zee TV in the 1995..At the American Idol Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. The Voice is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to American Idol, the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include The X Factor, America's Got Talent, Rising Star and The Sing-Off.|$|E
500|$|Ancient Traders {{design was}} {{influenced}} by that of board games and of the video games Elite and Advance Wars. Levius and his girlfriend dedicated around two months to test and balance the game's mechanics, gathering groups of friends {{to play the game}} [...] "without explaining anything <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> understand the rules and controls". He worked with Vcelka to design Ancient Traders appearance, including paper textures and clouds. He revealed that some of the maps' features came from a scan of an old military map of present-day Slovakia.

500|$|Books {{including}} Belair Early Years: Stories, Books as Bridges: Using Text to Connect Home and School Literacy and Learning, Funny Photo Alphabet: Teaching Guide, and What Is It About Me You Can't Teach? {{suggest the}} story {{be used to}} teach children about rhyming, repetition, and prediction. The story is suggested for use in curriculum to teach children about food, in books Humanics National Preschool Assessment Handbook, and The Complete Daily Curriculum for Early Childhood. Mildred R. Donoghue writes in Language Arts: Integrating Skills for Classroom Teaching that the story should be utilised {{in the course of}} primary education. In their work Success in Reading and Writing, authors Barbara J. Blackford, Helen Cappleman and Betty Cramer suggest the book be read aloud to children in kindergarten, and the teacher should subsequently quiz members of the class <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> recall items from the boy's shopping list. Authors Diane Stirling, Linda McKay, Georgia Archibald and Shelley Berg recommend the story in their book Character Education Connections: For School, Home and Community, in order to teach children the character trait of responsibility: [...] "A willingness to be accountable for your own actions without blaming others." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Eden of Cross Rhythms {{gave the}} album ten {{out of ten}} squares, saying [...] "With 'Lifesong' being officially [...] second release, the {{pressure}} is on <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> deliver. The simple answer is quite probably yes as the band use a refreshing formula that challenges the Church instead of serving up milk and cookies". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it three out of five stars, opining [...] "Overall, Lifesong is musically an assortment of experimentation and familiarity, as the band continues to offer songs with relatable messages to the church body. Frontman and chief songwriter Mark Hall's strained, shouting-style vocals is [...] still an acquired taste, along with his straightforward and often simplistic lyrics, but Lifesong is a noteworthy second chapter in an already impressive career for this young band". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting [...] " [...] comes from the school of U2-influenced modern-worship music, so its songs predictably build to sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes. The band's message is more distinctive, calling out the [...] "happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples" [...] to offer themselves to the lonely, the grieving, the desperate".|$|E
500|$|The Others {{intend to}} attack the camp and kidnap {{pregnant}} women for scientific research. The survivors are tipped off by the [...] "Other" [...] Karl (Blake Bashoff) and plan to kill the Others with dynamite-rigged tents.

The Others arrive, and while Sayid and Bernard detonate their tents, Jin misses his target, which results in their capture. After hearing only two explosions, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) turn back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> help. Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia), who was not allowed to accompany Sawyer and Juliet because of his weight, drives the van he found onto the beach, and the captives gain the upper hand, killing the remaining Others with the help of Sawyer and Juliet. Tom (M.C. Gainey) surrenders but Sawyer shoots him anyway.|$|E

The Tongan Government provided [...] (...) or about 5% of its national budget to facilitate the immediate start of emergency relief and repairs to essential services. Tents were supplied by the National Disaster Committee and Ministry of Works to act as temporary shelters {{for those who were}} homeless after the system. By March 19, the Tonga Electric Power Board had restored electricity to several consumers including major government buildings and the Nuku'alofa Business District. However, several consumers were expected to be without electric until at least June 1997. On March 25, the Acting Prime Minister of Tonga convened a meeting of donors, where an official request for international assistance was presented. At the meeting donors were requested to review existing of proposed bilateral programs, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be adjusted or brought forward to cater for the repairs or rebuilding of schools and other government buildings. The New Zealand Government deployed to Tonga, four electricity line mechanics, a fully equipped truck, along with various supplies including tarpaulins, blankets and electric. New Zealand also offered grants off up to [...] to replace village water tanks, and [...] towards the clean-up costs.|$|E

Blocher declared that Jews [...] "were only interested in money." [...] The letter also reported that in 1997, Blocher had stated the following that had resulted in his 1999 conviction: [...] "They (the Jews) could blackmail banks, you can blackmail governments, you can blackmail national banks, you can force them to give in.

"The {{doctors who}} have {{examined}} the bodies have arrived pretty well at the truth, and say that both men have been gripped by the throat, for the marks of the fingers are plainly visible, and their heads dashed together. But although this is, as we know, perfectly true, no one believes it; for the doctors themselves admit {{that it does not}} appear to them possible that any man would have had the strength requisite to completely batter in the skulls of two others, as has been done in this case. The police are searching the town for the man whose footsteps led in that direction, and as they know all the haunts of these ruffians and their associates it is likely enough that they will find him, especially as his face is sure to bear marks of Atherton's handiwork. Still, if they do find him, and he tells all he knows of the business, they will not be much nearer to tracing the actors in it to this ship. It is not probable that he recovered his senses until long after they were on board the boat, and can only say that while engaged in attempting to rob some passers-by he was suddenly knocked down. But even this they are not likely to get out of him first, for he will know that he used a knife, and is not likely to put himself in the way of punishment if he can help it. I came off at once, because I heard at the Consulate that the police are going to search every ship in the harbour <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find some wounded man, or get some clue to the mystery, so I must ask the doctor if his two patients are fit to be dressed and go up on deck." ...|$|E
