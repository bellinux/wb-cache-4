In order to be confirmed over their objection <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> must not discriminate against that class of creditors, and <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> must be found fair and equitable to that class.|$|R

Of the 117,000 Japanese troops defending Okinawa in Aprilâ€“June 1945, 94% were killed. American military leaders used these figures to estimate high casualties among American soldiers in <b>the</b> <b>planned</b> invasion of Japan.|$|E
