25|$|Ben Seyr {{was fitted}} with a {{patented}} steam-powered steering gear designed by Fisher's of Paisley, which could be detached if necessary. She had bunker capacity for 40 tons of coal with her bunkers designed to accommodate 20 tons {{on the port side}} and the other 20 tons on the starboard side. She carried 20 tons of water ballast aft and 12 <b>tons</b> <b>forward</b> and had a tank installed which contained 300 gallons of drinking water.|$|R
50|$|Ben Seyr was {{constructed}} by the Manchester Dry Docks Company at Ellesmere Port and was completed in 1920. Length 126 ft, beam 22 ft, depth 10 ft. Ben Seyr's cargo hold was divided into fore and aft hatches with a combined space of 12,400 cubic feet and which could accommodate 265 tons of cargo. She was driven by a marine compound reciprocating engine with her boiler manufactured by Cammell Laird's. The high-pressure cylinder was 15 inches in diameter, the low-pressure cylinder 32 inches with a 21-inch stroke.Ben Seyr was fitted with a patented steam-powered steering gear designed by Fisher's of Paisley, which could be detached if necessary.

40|$|Mechanical {{stimulation}} of the abdomen or anal appendages of a dragonfly nymph generally elicits a characteristic escape response.

30|$|Economic {{performance}} is usually analysed {{in terms of}} productivity [2, 3, 11], defined as the ratio between output (the volume of goods or services produced) and input (the volume of production factors used in the production process of these goods and services). The output of freight transport is generally {{measured in terms of}} physical units (<b>tons</b> or units <b>forwarded,</b> ton-kilometres etc.) or in terms of value (turnover). Production factors are measured in terms of personnel and vehicles [29, 33, 36, 39 – 41].|$|R
50|$|The vessels were 225 ft long between perpendiculars and 231.2 ft long overall, with {{a beam of}} 38 ft. Although {{retaining}} the open tank deck of previous LCT designs, the Mark 8 was protected by a taller bow section, which was fitted with powered doors and ramp. The capacity was eight 30-ton tanks, up to 13 fully loaded 3-ton trucks, or 350 tons of cargo. Maximum displacement and draught varied depending on the loadout: trucks {{would result in a}} 650-ton displacement, 3 ft draught at the bow, and 4 ft draught at the stern; for tanks, it was 780 <b>tons,</b> 3 ft <b>forward,</b> and 5 ft aft; while a full load of cargo resulted in a displacement of 880 tons, and draughts of 4 ft and 5 ft. Maximum displacement was 1,017 tons. The deeper draughts compared to previous vessels helped improve seakeeping.|$|R
50|$|This was the railway's {{reason for}} existence. It charged a fixed rate per ton for taking loaded coal wagons from Tilmanstone Colliery to Shepherdswell (no further) for {{switching}} onto {{the main line}} and for returning empties. Since the colliery possessed no locomotives, it also performed necessary shunting duties at the mine, including taking coal from the screens to the power station that ran the electric drainage pumps. Tonnage was over 200,000 after 1926. Rates agreed in 1932 were £0.0315 per ton to Shepherdswell, internal shunting at the colliery at £0.0126 per ton, 1,000 tons of free coal per year for railway use and £0.90 per ton over that. In return, the railway had to obtain all its coal from the colliery, and bad quality {{was to be a}} problem. The Southern Railway credited the EKLR £0.042 per <b>ton</b> of coal <b>forwarded</b> to them.|$|R

5000|$|The quarry had [...] "followed {{a similar}} pattern to North Grimston- rapid {{expansion}} in the post-First World War boom, enormous output in the 1920s, declining in the 1930s and fizzling out after the Second World war." [...] In 1919 a private siding {{was built in the}} quarry with exits in both directions onto the running line. Traffic growth was dramatic, peaking in 1925 with 107,261 <b>tons</b> of chalk <b>forwarded</b> to Thirsk, bi-passing Malton as the line had originally been conceived. This was down to 38,562 tons in 1926 and to a mere 3,000 tons in 1929. The quarry closed in 1930. It reopened later in the 1930s but output was sporadic and small scale, mainly travelling by road in bags. Such rail traffic as there [...] mainly coal for the quarry's kilns. The quarry had become disused by 1960 and has become a wildlife reserve.|$|R
40|$|The 4 T, 10 m free bore twin Solenoid with 4 Tm forward dipoles is {{discussed}} {{with an emphasis}} on the forward dipoles. This assembly, a possible detector magnet layout for the future circular collider for hadron-hadron physics, combines a 4 T axial magnetic field at the interaction point {{in the center of the}} twin Solenoid with off-axis magnetic fields generated by the two forward dipoles for the purpose of providing bending power to all particles emanating from the interaction point. The twin Solenoid provides 4 T over a free bore diameter of 10 m, resulting in a stored energy of 15. 4 GJ, a cold mass of 1. 25 kt, and a vacuum vessel mass of 1. 4 kt. This configuration leads to acceptable quench protection and mechanical properties. The forward dipoles are located in the stray field of the twin Solenoid, resulting in large forces and torques on the coils. Two forward dipole options are presented. In the first option, the main dipole coils are combined with lateral coils for the purpose of bringing the net force and torque on the cold mass to zero. In the second option, the lateral coils are omitted and the net force and torque is handled through the vacuum vessel. The first option results in a stored energy of 240 MJ, a cold mass of 250 tons, and a vacuum vessel of 150 tons, whereas the second options gives 130 MJ, 100 tons, and 180 <b>tons,</b> respectively. The <b>forward</b> dipole conductor comprises copper and NbTi and is force-flow cooled with helium. The superconducting coils are placed in a stainless steel coil casing and precompressed. The coil casings are then fixed to the main body support structure, thus allowing transfa er of forces and torques between the coils. The analyses indicate that this leads to good quench protection and mechanical behavior...|$|R
