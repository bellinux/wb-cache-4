5000|$|Bolivian {{penetration}} in {{the region}} went unopposed until 1927, when the first blood was shed over the Chaco Boreal. On 27 February a Paraguayan army foot patrol and its native guides were taken prisoners near the Pilcomayo River and held in the Bolivian outpost of Fortin Sorpresa, where {{the commander of the}} Paraguayan platoon, lieutenant Adolfo Rojas Silva, was shot and killed in suspicious circumstances. Fortín (Spanish for [...] "little fort") was the name used for the small pillbox and <b>trench-like</b> garrisons in the Chaco, although the troops' barracks usually were {{no more than a few}} mud huts. While the Bolivian government formally regretted the death of Rojas Silva, the Paraguayan public opinion called it [...] "murder". After the subsequent talks arranged in Buenos Aires failed to produce any agreement and eventually collapsed in January 1928, the dispute grew violent. On 5 December 1928 a Paraguayan cavalry unit overran Fortin Vanguardia, an advance outpost established by the Bolivian army a few miles northwest of Bahía Negra. The Paraguayans captured 21 Bolivian soldiers and burnt the scattered huts to the ground.The Bolivians retaliated with an air strike on Bahía Negra on 15 December, which caused few casualties and not much damage. On 14 December Bolivia seized Fortin Boquerón, which later would be the site of the first major battle of the campaign, at the cost of 15 Paraguayan dead. A return to the status quo ante was eventually agreed on 12 September 1929 in Washington, under pressure from the Pan American League, but an arms race had already begun and both countries were on a collision course. The regular border clashes might have led to war in the 1920s if either side was capable of waging war against one another. As it was, neither Paraguay or Bolivia had an arms industry and both sides had to import vast quantities of arms from Europe and the United States to arm themselves for the coming conflict. It was the need for both sides to import sufficient arms that held back the outbreak of the war to 1932, at which point both sides felt capable of resorting to arms to settle the long-running dispute.|$|E

40|$|Enhancement of {{the surface}} {{properties}} of a material by means of laser radiation has been amply demonstrated previously. In this work a comparative study for the surface modification of nylon 6, 6 has been conducted in order to vary the wettability characteristics using CO 2 and excimer lasers. This was done by producing 50 μm spaced (with depths between 1 and 10 μm) <b>trench-like</b> patterns using various laser parameters such as varying the laser power for the CO 2 laser and number of pulses for the excimer laser. Topographical changes were analysed using optical microscopy and white light interferometry which indicated that both laser systems can be implemented for modifying the topography of nylon 6, 6. Variations in the surface chemistry were evaluated using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and showed that the O 2 increased by up to 1. 5 % At. and decreased by up to 1. 6 % At. for the CO 2 and F 2 laser patterned samples, respectively. Modification of the wettability characteristics was quantified by measuring the advancing contact angle, which was found to increase in all instances for both laser systems. Emery paper roughened samples were also analysed {{in the same manner}} to determine that the topographical pattern {{played a major role in}} the wettability characteristics of nylon 6, 6. From this, it is proposed that the increase in contact angle for the laser processed samples is due to a mixed intermediate state wetting regime owed to the periodic surface roughness brought about by the laser induced <b>trench-like</b> topographical patterns...|$|E

40|$|We have {{introduced}} inherent openings into densely packed carbon nanotube arrays to study self-organized pattern formation when the arrays undergo a wetting–dewetting treatment from nanotube tips. These inherent openings, made of circular or elongated hollows in nanotube mats, serve as dewetting centres, from where liquid recedes from. As the dewetting centres initiate dry zones and the dry zones expand, surrounding nanotubes are {{pulled away from}} the dewetting centres by liquid surface tension. Among short nanotubes, the self-organized patterns are consistent with the shape of the inherent openings, i. e. slender openings lead to elongated <b>trench-like</b> structures, and circular holes result in relatively round nest-like arrangements. Nanotubes in a relatively high mat are more connected, like in an elastic body, than those in a short mat. Small cracks often initialize themselves in a relatively high mat, along two or more adjacent round openings; each of the cracks evolves into a trench as liquid dries up. Self-organized pattern control with inherent openings needs to initiate the dewetting process above the nanotube tips.

40|$|Megasonic {{agitation}} is used {{to improve}} the uniformity of the LIGA{sup 1 } development process. To investigate the acoustic wave fields induced by megasonic agitation, we compute wave fields for a development tank containing a submerged wafer and for a typical <b>trench-like</b> feature on the wafer face. This separate treatment of these two problems is advantageous, because the length scales of the tank and the feature differ by three to four orders of magnitude. A spectral method based on Green's functions {{is used to}} construct the acoustic wave field, avoiding the alternative of solving partial differential equations over the entire domain. The total acoustic wave field is obtained by superposing of the primary wave field and the first reflected wave field, which are computed in sequence without any need for iterations. The wafer interference to the wave field is treated directly by a priori recognition of shadow regions in the primary field and a concept of boundary of dependence in the reflected field. Unlike a divergent wave field produced by ultrasonic agitation, {{results show that the}} wave field in the tank becomes narrowly focused at megasonic frequencies such that the most effective agitation is confined in a region directly above the acoustic source; this numerical expectation has been verified analytically and further confirmed experimentally by Sandia's LIGA Group. {sup [13]} The amplitude of the focused wave pressure is proportional to square root of the wave frequency. The wave pattern in a feature cavity also depends strongly on the orientation of the wafer and the aspect ratio of the cavity.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Gravity, {{magnetic}} and seismic {{data indicate}} that the oceanic crust is 9. 7 km thick west of the Continental Borderland. The top of the mantle is about 12 km deep under the Borderland, and deepens to 27 km beneath the Peninsular Ranges of Baja California. The mantle is about 20 km {{below the surface of}} the Imperial Valley and deepens to 27 km under the area east of the Imperial Valley. The age of the youngest detectable remnant magnetic anomaly over the oceanic crust is about 16. 5 million years at 21. 3 °N Lat. and decreases to the south. A magnetic anomaly expected along the continuation of the San Benito Fault Zone is not detected by this study. A gravity low along the base of the Patton Escarpment is at least partially the result of a buried <b>trench-like</b> depression. In the vicinity of 31. 3 °N Lat., 119. 3 °W Long. this depression is filled with 2 km of sediments. The geophysical and geological data are interpreted as indicating a 6 km thick section of Franciscan rocks that extends from the west edge of the Borderland to the Coronado Escarpment. Magnetic data suggest that an ophiolite may be present within or on top of the Franciscan rocks. Several of the ridges in the Borderland have cores of high density rocks which are interpreted as intrusives. The area just south of the San Clemente basin has an anomalously thin upper crust. The gross crustal structure of this region is comparable to the Imperial Valley region and may represent a former site of crustal rifting which occurred when the East Pacific Rise was subducted under this part of the North American plate.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the palynology, stratigraphy, sedimentology and palaeogeographic setting of Lower Cretaceous turbiditic and terrigenous deep-sea sediments at the Tethyan margins of Africa and Alboran (External Domain of the Rif, and Flysch Nappes). During the Early Cretaceous terrigenous turbiditic deep-water sedimentation characterizes two different palaeogeographic domains {{in the southern}} part of the western Tethys: In the northern area of the External Domain (Ketama Unit of the Rif) alternating turbiditic arenites and pelites are interpreted as sediments of a distal part of a fan system on the Tethyan margin of Africa. The main sources for the terrigenous material were situated in Central and Western Algeria; only little sand transited through the Prerif and the Mesorif zones of Morocco. The terrigenous sedimentation began in the Hauterivian, but the main turbiditic cycles are of Aptian to Lower and Middle Albian age. The Flysch Domain probably was situated far to the Northeast with respect to the Rif basin, at the western and southern margins of the Alboran microplate. Relatively proximal turbidites form most of the Tisirène Nappe, whereas more distal turbidites constitute the series of the Melloussa and the Chouamat Nappes. The existence of two different source areas is demonstrated, one to the NE and the other to the NW of the depositional area. The turbidites probably were deposited on a E-W oriented fan system which progradated into a longitudinal <b>trench-like</b> trough. In the Central Rif area, the Tisirène Flysch is of Valanginian to Albian (pre-Vraconian) age. In the Western Rif and in the Melloussa and Chouamat Nappes of the whole area no sediments older than Aptian have been found. The stratigraphy of the investigated series is based on a new tentative palynostratigraphic zonation, using pollen, spores and dinoflagellate cysts. Rich and well preserved assemblages have been found in the Western Rif only, whereas the samples of the Tisirène Nappe and the Chouamat Nappe in the Central and Eastern Rif have been affected by some thermal alteration.

40|$|The Fore-Alps {{of western}} Veneto and Trentino regions {{belong to the}} central Southern Alps ŽNE Italy., {{in which there is}} little {{evidence}} of very fresh surface ruptures or surface faulting. This does not seem to match historical data about earthquakes, some of which have been very intense. The strong influence of the inherited structures makes it difficult to detect a direct link between morphotectonic features and present-day stress fields. In the present study, four areas ŽOrsara, Scandole, Naole and Soran. with surface faulting and surface rupture features were examined, and models of morphotectonic evolution are discussed. In the Lessini Mountains, the Orsara graben and Scandole ridge show examples of surface faulting and surface rupture, respectively, reactivating Paleogene normal faults and fractures. Within the Orsara graben, rocky bluffs displace the previous morphological features. The bluffs are some decimetres to some metres high and are practically devoid of evidence of either physical or chemical weathering; on the slopes above them are steep areas which may be interpreted as the remnants of previous strongly weathered bluffs. The Scandole ridge has many trenches, some with rocky walls, which {{may be the result of}} several episodes of morphotectonic rupture. In the Giudicarie Belt, the Naole and Mt. Soran surface faulting landforms are details within large frontal culmination walls of Neogene thrusts. The Naole ridge corresponds to the southeastern sector of Monte Baldo. Here, inside a fault angle valley, a sinuous scarp originating from surface faulting marks the base of the fault scarp slope. Ridge splitting is the expression of the backward migration of separation niches due to slope tectonics, also evidenced on the slope by several terrace-like features and by a lower belt of very thick slope breccias. On Mt. Soran, in the Gruppo di Brenta massif, the surface faulting scarp faces uphill, giving rise to a <b>trench-like</b> feature. Downvalley of the scarp, there is the niche of a large landslide dated to 3 kyears B. P. All these landforms are consistent with slope tectonic movements caused by intense earthquakes. Whereas the morphostructures in the Lessini Mountains are the result of responses by sensitive structures, the Naole and Mt. Soran features express the evolution of frontal culmination walls of thrusts, with clear evidence of present-day tectonic activity. On the basis of the weathering of the scarps and associated features, the relative seismotectonic episodes probably occurred between the Bronze and Middle Ages...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} {{the growth and}} {{structure}} of titanium dioxide films on two morphologically different transition metal surfaces, namely the <b>trench-like</b> rhenium(10 - 10) and the hexagonal ruthenium(0001). The following methods were used: X-ray photoelectron and Auger-electron spectroscopy (XPS and AES), {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED), low energy Helium-ion scattering (LEIS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Titanium dioxide films on rhenium(10 - 10) were synthesized by co-adsorption of titanium vapor in an oxygen atmosphere up to a thickness of 500 Å and investigated by means of LEED, LEIS, XPS and XRD. In order to calibrate the titanium flux, the growth mode of titanium on the Re(10 - 10) surface was determined by means of LEIS, XPS and LEED. At room temperature titanium grows layer by layer on Re(10 - 10) with its own lattice parameter. The parameters for co-adsorption with constant titanium flux, i. e. temperature, oxygen partial pressure and the constitution of the substrate interface turned out to be very important for the structure of the films. For oxygen pressures above 5 x 10 - 7 mbar and a temperature of 830 K the films consist already in the monolayer (ML) range of TiO 2 as shown by XPS Ti 2 p signal whereas the Ti:O stoichiometry reached the ratio 1 : 2 only for thicker films because of the oxygenated rhenium interface. As function of coverage starting from the (1 x 3) - 2 O/Re(10 - 10) a p(2 x 2), a dim (1 x 1) and finally a stable pg(2 x 2) LEED pattern with respect to Re(10 - 10) was observed. The origin of the latter could be Brookite(001) as well as (2 x 1) reconstructed rutile(011). Based on the occurrence and analysis of faceting phenomena, i. e. LEED spots not running towards the nominal (0, 0) reflex with increasing primary electron energy, Brookite(001) could ruled out and as result two domains of rutile(011) -(2 x 1) each with two (2 x 1) similarly reconstructed rutile(011) facets. This result, rutile(011) -(2 x 1) ||Re(10 - 10), was also obtained by XRD at the Berlin synchrotron facility BESSY. In addition to the faceting phenomena the slow decrease of the rhenium LEIS signal as well as the increase of the rhenium XPS signal during heating at 920 K indicates island growth. Comparison of the change of XPS Ti 2 p intensity during film growth with a uniform simultaneous multilayer growth model developed in this work yields an average island height of (50 ± 10) layers. The disappearance of the (1 x 3) - 2 O/Re(10 - 10) oxygen phase in LEED experiments and the development of the O:Ti XPS signal ratio indicate that the rhenium surface is fully covered after 1 - 1. 5 ML of titanium oxide deposition. Therefore we assign the growth mode with these parameters as Stranski-Krastanov-like of rutile(011) -(2 x 1) on Re(10 - 10). If we grow titanium oxide on one monolayer Ti on Re(10 - 10) keeping the other parameters constant we get fully oxidized titanium dioxide in addition to the rutile(011) -(2 x 1) LEED phase another so called pseudo(1 x 1) LEED pattern with respect to Re(10 - 10). Analysis of the recurring faceting phenomena reveals rutile(100) island growth with two { 110 } facets. Both of these LEED patterns are observed in all deposition experiments at temperatures of 720 K and below, on some occasions after oxidation at higher temperatures. Only films prepared at 830 K in 1 x 10 - 7 mbar oxygen did not exhibit the pg(2 x 2) LEED pattern of rutile(011) -(2 x 1). These films have different LEED patterns and consist of partially oxidized titanium oxide (XPS). Prolonged heating in 5 x 10 - 7 mbar oxygen was necessary for fully oxidized films. Analysis of the resultant streaky LEED patterns with a multiplicity of reflexes suggest growth of rutile(100) in at least three mosaic domains, one parallel to Re(10 - 10), the others slightly tilted. Possible reasons for the unusual growth behavior are the ability of rutile(100) to grow as a reduced (1 x 3) reconstructed surface and the apparent necessity of a fairly thick buffer layer to grow rutile(011) -(2 x 1). The growth of titanium dioxide on the hexagonal ruthenium(0001) surface was investigated by means of STM, XPS and AES. Due to the alloying affinity of Ti and Ru, a titanium oxide film pre-grown at low temperature was finally/fully oxidized at elevated temperature and pressure. The first titanium oxide layer fully covers the Ru(0001) surface as Moiré. While XPS intensities of O 1 s and Ti 2 p signals suggest this Moiré consists of titanium dioxide, we interpret atomically resolved STM images as two hexagonal oxygen layers with titanium atoms in the octahedral positions also yielding TiO 2. After a second poorly ordered layer, island growth begins. Atomically resolved STM images revealed the growth of rutile(110) on Ru(0001). Comparing statistics of the island heights with the uniform simultaneous multilayer growth model gives an average island height of (33 ± 5) layers. First experiments concerning the growth of gold on these titanium dioxide films are presented. One important result of the ongoing work is the imaging of gold clusters with 2 - 5 atoms in the troughs of rutile(110) beside the typically observed clusters with 3 nm diameter by STM...|$|E
