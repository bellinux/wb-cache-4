5|$|Unwilling {{to allow}} <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> to {{continue}} their practices, Madoc instigates war between <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> and the much smaller Hoamen nation. While <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> bring a large army, Madoc is able to use Welsh technology and superior tactics to overcome them. The Hoamen are able to take many prisoners while the Aztec king contracts a mortal illness. Following the battle Madoc shocks <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> by releasing the prisoners instead of sacrificing them, and provides leeches to help the Aztec king recover from his disease. This leads to a treaty between <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> and the Hoamen which abolishes human sacrifice. The Aztec priests fear to stop the practice, so the Aztec king decides that his people will abandon their religion and take up a monotheistic religion based on a God of love.|$|E

A battle takes place in the water surrounding the Aztec city on boats, and the superior Welsh ships are able to win. <b>The</b> <b>Aztecs,</b> unwilling to stop, turn to superstitious rituals and priests travel to a sacred mountain to make sacrifices. However, a sudden lava eruption kills the priests. This causes <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> to believe {{that they do not have}} the support of their gods and they cease their fighting.

5|$|The {{first half}} of the poem, Madoc in Wales, {{describes}} Madoc, a young Welsh nobleman, whose family breaks down into a series of bloody disputes over royal succession. Madoc, unwilling to participate in the struggle, decides to journey to America to start a new life. When he reaches America, he is witness to the bloody human sacrifices that the Aztec nation demands of the surrounding tribes in Aztlan. Madoc, believing it is a defiance against God, leads the Hoamen, a local tribe, into warfare against <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b> Eventually, Madoc conquers them and he is able to convert the Americans to Christianity before returning to Wales to find more recruits for his colony. In the second part, Madoc in Aztlan, Madoc returns to find that <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> have returned to their human sacrifices. After long and bloody warfare, Madoc is able to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> and force them out of their homeland and into exile.|$|E
5|$|The story follows Madoc's journey as {{they travel}} West again, contending with {{problems}} such as storms and dissent among the crew. Eventually, they reach America and are received by the natives. Madoc takes {{on one of the}} natives, Lincoya, as his guide when they begin to explore the area of the Mississippi River. As they continue to travel, they soon come to Aztlan, the original homeland of the Aztec nation, and Madoc discovers that <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> require human sacrifices for their gods. Madoc decides to interfere with tribal affairs and stop two children from being taken by <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> to be sacrificed. Following this, he encourages a peaceful tribe, the Hoamen, to take up arms against <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b> To further protect the Hoamen, Madoc goes to the Aztec capital to deal with their king. While there, he is shown by the king how great <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> are and how no one could stand against them. Madoc witnesses among the buildings and monuments piles of skulls and corpses along with other horrific scenes.|$|E

In Tabasco, Cortés anchored his ships at Potonchán, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cortés was able to communicate with <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b> From Tabasco, Cortés continued to along the coast, and went on to conquer <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a nose ring.

Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. It was popular among <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs,</b> the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility. The name of the Nez Perce tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe. <b>The</b> <b>Aztecs,</b> Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama.

5|$|It is {{not known}} when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used {{for a variety of}} {{purposes}} by <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs,</b> whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image {{at the center of the}} myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan. <b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would keep moving.|$|E

5|$|Nahuatl {{has been}} spoken in central Mexico {{since at least}} the seventh century CE.

During the centuries preceding the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> had expanded to incorporate a large part of central Mexico, and its influence caused the variety of Nahuatl spoken by the residents of Tenochtitlan to become a prestige language in Mesoamerica. At the conquest, with the introduction of the Latin alphabet, Nahuatl also became a literary language, and many chronicles, grammars, works of poetry, administrative documents and codices were written in it during the 16th and 17th centuries. This early literary language based on the Tenochtitlan variety has been labeled Classical Nahuatl, and is among the most studied and best-documented languages of America.|$|E

However, there are struggles with his people and <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> because <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> have turned back to their pagan gods. As such, the peace between the two groups ends while a shaman of the Hoamen people starts to convince the people to also worship pagan gods.
