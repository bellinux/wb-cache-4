40|$|One of the {{groundbreaking}} {{developments in the}} history of technologically mediated music was the conception and construction of the delay line system. Although in the past and present, the concepts of the delay line system have been conceived, constructed, and marketed in a variety of fashions, from tape recorders to analog effect pedals to software algorithms, its purpose and utility remains the same. It consists of data or sound waveforms that are passed along a single loop across multiple "nodes" that read and then record new altered "data" back onto the loop as it completes a multitude of indefinite "cycles. " These cycles are repetitions of sound that build and fade based on the technical parameters of the nodes and nature of the cycle. This assemblage represents the culmination of an evolving technique to erect a musical practice that exudes ambience and coloration, rather than progressive melodies and harmonies. Originally built as an assemblage of several tape recorders looped together with a single sequential <b>tape</b> <b>feed,</b> the technological and artistic variations that this sound duplication system underwent in the past five decades represents great advancements in musical and technical thought. These experimental directions continue to give rise to unique processes and systems of music composition, as the use of the tape recorder delay line system has greatly surpassed its initial usage as a strict "electronic" instrument, blurring the line between the electronic and acoustic, the performer and the composer, and the engineer and the producer. As one such individual that straddles these roles, Brian Eno exhibits foresight and experimentation with delay line systems and represents the archetype for the compositional mindset in question- one profoundly engaged with the parameters of the creative process itself. Rather than endeavor to create traditionally structured music or music that is laden with intention or narrative, Eno and his contemporaries developed what may be thought of as the "process or system" approach to guide the development of their music. They develop a creative schema (often represented mechanically as a complexity of multiple tape recorders passing the same feed of tape between them through multiple "variables" that alter the content of the sound) either as harmonic equalization filters, filters that bend the phase of the waveform, or filters that adjust the speed and frequency of the sound. In Eno's pieces such as Discrete Music and Music for Airports, these strategies and systems may be heard- extremely pretty, ambient and repetitious. With this backdrop in mind, I intend to explore Eno and others' use of the delay line technique with the following questions in mind: 1.) What is it about delay line processes that produce ranges of emotions such as calm, longing, thoughtfulness, etc? Listeners generally associate the emotions of a musical work with the intentionality of the motives and gestures provided by the composer. When the delay line system delivers these emotions absent such musical factors, one becomes compelled to question why deep seated emotional reactions still take place in the listener. 2.) What is it about pre-conceived delay line processes that attracts Brian Eno, other musicians, and the listeners? The aesthetic experience of the "traditional" composer and the listener diverge as the composer toils through the parts of the piece, whereas the listener hears only the cohesive whole. The aesthetic experience of the "delay line system" composer {{in the absence of any}} direct encounter with pre-conceived parts of the music (as the delay line system lacks these partitions) likely evolves in a different manner. The composer sharing the anticipation of the listener compels an investigation into the origins of the fascination that both parties share when experiencing delay line pieces. 3.) When the composer assumes a passive role in the unfolding of a musical piece, how should listeners evaluate the role the composer? Instead of the composer as an intentional actor, the delay line systems commits the composer to the role of a creative, yet distant, engineer. The work of composers like Brian Eno, individuals that only provide a guiding hand in the actual construction of a piece, fundamentally questions the popular and academic view of the composer as an agent "directing musical traffic" and controlling all of the minute parts of the musical whole. 4.) Does the use the delay line system as a process or system of musical composition constitute improvisation? The delay line system's repetitious nature allows for the composer to capitalize on unanticipated musical moments, often interpreted as "mistakes" in a typical compositional framework. Using audio manipulation devices in the sequence of the delay line system, the composer is able to insert variables when these mistakes occur- often in the same manner as a jazz or blues musician that relies on the unpredictability of a piece to make a new musical statement. If the dynamic between the composer and the delay line system does amount to improvisation, what is the nature of this improvisation that makes it fascinating to the listener? 5.) What should a listener's conception of a "musical work" be when music is being produced with the delay line system? A musical work such as Beethoven's 9 th Symphony represents a traditional composition as it relies on the development of theme, tonal variations, and virtuostic ornamentation to generate a sense of grandeur or beauty. The presence of ambient and electroacoustic works developed by the assembly of delay line processes and systems, compositions that intrinsically lack these commonly anticipated traits of development and variation, demand a re-examination this notion of the "musical work. ...|$|E

The reader decoded the message header, and sent the header characters to the director. The director, much like a telephone switch, connected the receiving console to a sending console in the same switching center by a cross-office connection. The message was transmitted from the receiving console to the sending console, character by character, punching a second paper tape at the sending console. Cross-office connections, and their readers and punches, were slightly faster than external connections, to limit congestion {{to the edges of}} the network. Each sending console also consisted of a paper tape punch and reader. Output from each sending console was transmitted via outgoing lines to other switching centers or to destination teleprinters.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore how {{caregivers}} caring for severely demented patients experience ethical conflict situations. Feeding patients in a late state of dementia was chosen as focus. Special attention was paid to analyses of the caregivers' experiences with regard to their feelings, use of force, interpretations of the patients' behaviour and their ethical reasoning. The study was carried out in five separate parts, presented as five papers. A phenomenological - hermeneutic approach was consistent. Personal interviews, a projective defence mechanism test, the Meta Contrast Technique and an analysis of patient/caregiver behaviour as shown in video <b>taped</b> <b>feeding</b> sessions were the methods used. Study participants were forty-one caregivers in psychogeriatric care, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nurses' assistants. The result indicated that, when facing ethical decisions the caregivers were caught in a double bind conflict due to the contradicting ethical demands "Keep the patient alive!" and "Don't cause the patient suffering!". The difficulty to interpret what the patients experienced and the impossibility to know for sure what actions would be right or wrong were sources of anxiety. They defined force feeding individually, yet a pattern was found. Some caregivers defined force feeding according to the amount of persuasiveness or violence they had to perform. Some regarded force feeding from a patient wish perspective. A majority combined the two dimensions. The caregivers' ethical reasoning showed that their decision making was to be regarded as a process grounded on ethical rules. Interdependence in the relation caregiver/patient made them develop their reasoning in a direction of existential reasoning.

40|$|The mass {{production}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a cost effective process {{is still a}} challenge for further research and application of CNTs. This research focussed on the deposition of CNTs on a continuously-fed carbon substrate via arc discharge at atmospheric pressure. In this work, modifications, control and optimization of the available arc-discharge reactor were conducted. New reactor support and new <b>tape</b> <b>feeding</b> mechanisms {{were added to the}} reactor for better temperature assessment, longer operating period and better control of the speed of the tape. The influence of inter-electrode gap, substrate velocity and arc current on the surface temperature were investigated. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were produced at lower currents (< 20 A) and at larger inter-electrode gaps. Further investigation shows that inter-electrode gap influenced both the arc characteristic and the anode surface temperature (Ts). Here, Ts was measured by an optical pyrometer. The inter-electrode gap was found to indirectly affect the formation of NTs. Anode surface temperature (Ts) varied with gap, reaching a minimum at an intermediate gap. Higher CNTs yield was found at this lowest Ts. This minimum Ts is consistent with the presence of a cloud of nanoparticles ejected by the heated graphite/carbon surfaces. These graphene fragments are thought to later fold and form nanotube âseedsâ and then develop into multiwall nanotubes. This cloud of nanoparticles also may affect the electrical conductivity {{at the front of the}} anode. Simulation of the arc behaviour, i. e. temperature distributions and flow properties of the plasma, using a computer package Comsol Multiphysics 3. 2, was stable only when the electrical conductivity of a dusty plasma near to the electrodes was included. Our experiments show that carbon nanotubes grew better at a Ts range of ~ 3650 K - 3700 K and at the tape speed of 3 mm/s. The results from our work also strongly suggested that tiny carbon crystallites are the main intermediates for CNT growth in an electric arc. The limiting factor for a solid state growth mechanism, therefore, is high temperature annealing of carbon or graphene fragments. Further work should aim to understand the growth mechanism of CNTs, produce comprehensive analysis on the arc plasma composition and also explore the possibility of producing CNTs at higher rates...|$|R

40|$|Benthic {{suspension}} feeders {{can respond}} to variations in food resources by behavioral and physiological means, but {{little is known about}} their ability to adjust the mechanics of particle capture. We examined influences of nutritional state (i. e. growth rate as influenced by food level) and temperature on suspension-feeding mechanics of the spionid polychaete Polydora cornuta (previously P. ligni). Worms were conditioned for 5 to 10 d in 4 treatments including 2 levels of suspended algae (50 or 0. 1 Î¼g chl a l- 1, representing bloom and non-bloom conditions, respectively) and 2 temperatures (15 or 5 ÂºC, representing temperate spring/summer and winter, respectively). Both of these factors had significant, direct influences on growth rate. Worms of equal body size were then video <b>taped</b> while suspension <b>feeding</b> in a flume at their respective temperatures but with identical concentrations of food, including polystyrene beads for observing feeding mechanics. Worms with the lower growth rate captured beads at a rate 2. 1 x that of worms with the higher growth rate, and worms at 15 ÂºC captured beads at a rate 1. 9 x that of worms at 5 ÂºC, with no interactions between these factors. Particle contact rates did not differ among treatments; rather, the results were due solely to altered retention efficiencies (the proportion of contacted particles that were captured). Further experiments indicated that worms with the lower growth rate had enhanced adhesive strength of the mucous coating that retains particles on the palps and that low temperature inhibited the effectiveness of cilia in aiding retention. This is the first evidence that a benthic suspension feeder modifies the retention efficiency on its appendages, which it does in response to changes in its nutritional state. The enhancement of retention by mucus when under nutritional stress should act as a compensatory response at times or places of sparse food...|$|R

The stomach fullness was calculated by BÃ 100 /A. A and B show the volume of stomach and its contents, respectively. Both volumes were estimated by eye measurement. The Shidamabushi-dana in which the crab at free larval stage shelters was set in this waters and the specimens were collected with a landing net in this Shidamabushi-dana. The young crabs settled {{on the bottom of}} the tideland and the neighbor shallow water were collected by a dredge and gill nets. Most of the stomach contents in the free larval stage of the blue crab were occupied by Crustacea such as Gammarus, Balanus larva, Copepoda and Brachyura. The stomach contents in the settled stage on the sea bottom were occupied by shellfish and polychaeta. Species composition in these stomach contents was similar to the fauna in habitat of the blue crab. The selection for the feeding appeared with growth of the crab. The activity rhythms in feeding were recognized by the analysis of the stomach fullness of the blue crab taken from the tideland. They also were confirmed in the feeding experiment in which the stomach fullness was examined at three hour intervals after giving <b>Tapes</b> as the <b>feed</b> to the crab at the pond of the Experimental Station. The stomach fullness of the crab was high at the flood and low at the ebb tide in day and night. It seems that the rhythms of feeding is related to the ebb and flood. Further, it was clarified by the experiment in the laboratory that the feed in the stomach was digested in about six hours. 1. ç¨ã¬ãåæããå¹¼ã¬ãå¾æã®ã¬ã¶ããå¯¾è±¡ã«çºè²ã«ä¼´ãé£æ§ã®å¤åã¨æé¤çæãæããã«ãããã,èåå®¹ç©çµæãèã®åæºåº¦ãèª¿æ»ï½¥è§£æãã. 2. ã¬ã¶ãã¯è²é¡,å¤æ¯é¡,ç²æ®»é¡ãªã©ãå¹åºãæé£ã,ãã®ä¸»è¦ãªç¨®é¡ã¯,è²é¡ã§ã¯ãããã®ã¹ã¬ã¤,å¤æ¯é¡,ç²æ®»é¡ã§ã¯ã¨ã³ã¨ã,ãã¸ããå¹¼ç,ããèé¡åã³ã«ãé¡ã§ãã£ã. 3. ã·ãããã·æ£ã«çæ¯ããéæ³³æã®ç¨ã¬ãã®èåå®¹ç©ã¯ç²æ®»é¡ãå¤§é¨åãå ãã¦ããã,å¹²æ½åã«åºçãããã®ã§ã¯æé·ã«å¾ã,è²é¡ãå¤æ¯é¡ã®æé£ãå¤ããªãå¾åãèªãããã. 4. ã·ãããã·æ£ã«åºç¾ããã¬ã¶ãã®å¨ç²å¹é·å¥åä½æ°åã³èåå®¹ç©çµæã«ãã¨ã¥ã,å¨ç²å¹é· 15 mmãå¢ã«,è±ç®ä»¤C_ 4 ä»¥å¾ã®ãã®ã®å¤ãã¯ã·ãããã·æ£ããé¢æ£ãã¦å¹²æ½åã«åºçã,ãã®æ,é£æ§ã«ãå¤åãçãã. 5. èåå®¹ç©ã¯çæ¯ç°å¢ã®åç©ç¸ã¨ããå¯¾å¿ããã,çºè²ãé²ãã¨ã¬ã¶ãã®é¤çç©ã«å¯¾ããé¸ææ§ãèªãããã. 6. ã¬ã¶ãã®æé¤ã«çµæå¨æããã,ããã¯æ¼å¤ããæ½®æ±ã®ãªãºã ã¨ããä¸è´ãã. ããªãã¡,æ¼å¤ã®ä¸ãæ½®ããæºæ½®æã«æ´»çºã«æé¤ã,å¹²æ½®æã«ããã¦ã®ç´ 6 æéã§èåã®é¤ãæ¶åãã. ãããã®å¨æã¯å±å¤ã®å®é¨ã§ãæ±ããã,æ¶åæéã¯å®¤åã®æ°´æ§½å®é¨ã§ãç¢ºè¨¼ããã...|$|R
