5|$|By the mid-1980s, the {{flexible}} fiberoptic bronchoscope {{had become an}} indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and anesthesia communities. The digital revolution of the 21st century has brought newer <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the CMOS active pixel sensor (CMOS APS) to generate {{a view of the}} glottis so that the trachea may be intubated.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} sorority's 75th anniversary, Alpha Kappa Alpha contributed funds to {{decrease}} Africa's poverty {{with the establishment}} of African Village Development Program (AVDP). As a conjoint program with Africare, the sorority sought to decrease poverty in African villages. In collaboration with the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH), the sorority built ten schools in South Africa after apartheid ended, and it donated computer <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E

5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level of <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Forerunners but, after losing {{a war with}} them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} the mass suicide of the Asgard race, who try to {{preserve}} their legacy by giving all of their accumulated knowledge and <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SG-1 team and {{the crew of the}} Earth ship Odyssey. When the ship is attacked by Ori warships, Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter creates a time dilation field. The field was programmed so while only fractions of a second had passed outside of the field, It takes fifty years inside the field until a defense against the Ori weapons can be found.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{special effects}} are {{generally}} recognized {{to be among}} the best of all time, using the available (non-digital) <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fullest. In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently motion controlled using computers. Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.|$|E
5|$|This growth would {{continue}} due to transportation {{improvements in the}} 1820s. Troy's businessmen had already built a turnpike to Schenectady, the path followed today by Route 2 from Troy to Colonie. These trade routes were enhanced by the Erie and Champlain canals, which opened new markets {{to the north and}} west, while the Troy Steamboat Company's debut did likewise for the south. The access to iron ore mines in the Adirondack Mountains also got some local businessmen into iron refining. In 1835 the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad brought that <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, and in 1842 the completion of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad linked Troy to the vast network that reached as far west as Buffalo.|$|E
5|$|With {{the tender}} relaunched in 2007 as the F-X2 competition, the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to {{purchase}} at least 36 aircraft– {{with a potential}} for 84 additional aircraft– to replace the country's A-1Ms, F-5BRs, and Mirage IIIs. Among the participants were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16BR, JAS Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and the modernized Su-35. Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su-35 in 2008, Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country 120 aircraft with full technology transfer, as well as participation in the PAK FA programme. In December 2013, the Gripen NG light fighter was selected because of its low cost and the transfer of <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian industry.|$|E
