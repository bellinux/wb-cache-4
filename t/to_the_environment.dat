5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> and this {{might be described as}} alert, clouded, drowsy, or stuporous.

5|$|Fallout from {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} prior to 1980 contributed {{a small amount}} of californium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.|$|E

5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. The {{presence or absence of}} gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
40|$|Generally, any damages {{caused by}} {{earthquakes}} and typhoons are never called as environmental problems. We do not also call tragedies of SARS (Sevene Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Mad-Cow diseases as environmental problems. In the present study, <b>the</b> author tried <b>to</b> conceptually denote <b>the</b> environmental problems with figuration in comparing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other problems. Environmental disruptions and pollutions are cases to cause any damages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> with large excess of energy flows, among all actions of human societies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments.</b> Natural disasters are {{problems caused by}} one-way actions from environments to human and human societies regardless of wills and actions of human societies, even when human societies never act <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments.</b> Social problems are various affairs to happen between human and human or among human societies regadless of the condition of surrounding environments. Environmental problems can be denoted as cases, which are phenomena to have consequently bad influences on human and human societies, among almost all actions to environments by human and human societies.
