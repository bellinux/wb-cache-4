Tench performed with the band on the album version of the song.|$|E

500|$|Historian Michael Wolffsohn {{supports}} the Ministry of Defense's decision to continue recognition of Rommel, although {{he thinks the}} focus should {{be put on the}} later stage of Rommel's life, when he began <b>thinking</b> <b>more</b> seriously about war and politics, and broke with the regime. MDR reports that, [...] "Wolffsohn declares the Bundeswehr wants to have politically thoughtful, responsible officers from the beginning, thus a tradition of 'swashbuckler' and 'humane rescuer' is not intended". According to authors like Ulrich vom Hagen and Sandra Mass though, the Bundeswehr (as well as NATO) deliberately endorses the ideas of chivalrous warfare and apolitical soldiering associated with Rommel. According to Cornelia Hecht, the Bundeswehr believes that [...] "chivalry and fairness", which Rommel embodied more than any other Wehrmacht generals, are timeless military virtues. At a Ministry conference soliciting input on the matter, Dutch general Ton van Loon advised the Ministry that, although there can be historical abuses hidden under the guise of military tradition, tradition is still essential for the esprit de corps and part of that tradition should be the leadership and achievements of Rommel.|$|E
500|$|According to McGuire, {{the game}} {{did not start}} with any game plan to get Chamberlain 100 points. After a few minutes, the Warriors led 19–3, and their star center had already scored 13 points and made his first five shots. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the Knicks trailed 42–26, and in his typical style, Chamberlain had already scored 23 points, making all nine of his free throws. Free throws were the weakest part of his game, making barely more than half in his first seasons. He had started {{shooting}} free throws underhanded that season per McGuire's suggestion. Chamberlain at that point was <b>thinking</b> <b>more</b> about a free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points; the NBA record was 24 free throws made in a game. Imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble. After one foul, he snapped at the referee, [...] "Well, why don't you just give the guy a hundred now and we'll all go home!" [...] Neither referee had ever been a lead official before, and Imhoff privately wished a stronger lead was working the game. By halftime, the Warriors had lost some of their edge, but still led 79–68. Chamberlain's point total stood at 41. The Warriors felt little excitement, as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions. [...] "I often came into the locker room with 30 or 35 points, therefore, 41 points was not a big deal", Chamberlain later explained. During halftime, the Warriors' Guy Rodgers said, [...] "Let's get the ball to Dip. Let's see how many he can get." [...] McGuire agreed.|$|E

Right-handed individuals used executive and local <b>thinking</b> styles <b>more.</b> There is a relationship between handedness and thinking styles.

2500|$|The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche {{has been}} said to have taken nearly all of his {{political}} philosophy from Aristotle. However debatable this is, Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ("natural slaves"), and the natural superiority (virtue, arete) of others. It is Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. Ayn Rand accredited Aristotle as [...] "the greatest philosopher in history" [...] and cited him as {{a major influence on}} her <b>thinking.</b> <b>More</b> recently, Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition {{in a way that is}} anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.|$|E
2500|$|However {{without the}} expert's help, Seppmann and Hegley {{immediately}} clogged the millstone. [...] <b>Thinking</b> <b>more</b> speed would help, {{they put on}} full sail. [...] Instead the rising wind set the arms spinning so fast the operators couldn't stop it. [...] The wooden parts grew so hot that the windmill {{was in danger of}} catching fire. [...] Meanwhile, a crowd of onlookers had gathered outside, eager to see Seppmann's curiosity finally in operation and surprised that it seemed to be running so fast it might tear itself apart. [...] In desperation Seppmann tossed something into the gears, but it shattered and a piece was flung away with such force that it shot a hole through the rim of Seppmann's hat. [...] At last Seppmann and Hegley were able to unfurl some of the sails and halt the mill. [...] Ultimately they learned that the clog was due to poor dressing of the millstones and after making improvements, including a better brake, were operational by late September.|$|E

[...] He reported that, shortly after arriving on Friday morning, the team was taken by friends on an automobile trip to The Hermitage, the plantation that had been owned by Andrew Jackson. [...] In the afternoon, the team conducted [...] "a brief limbering drill" [...] at Vanderbilt's new field. [...] In his pre-game report, Green expressed concern that, despite assistant coach Sturzenegger's scouting report, the team was overconfident:"The Michigan boys are confident that they will win. [...] Perhaps they are a trifle too confident. [...] It can not be denied that the Wolverines are <b>thinking</b> <b>more</b> of the first conference game next Saturday with Ohio State than they are of the impending tussle with the southern squad.

2500|$|In {{the first}} stage of the Tour de France Sagan came in third.

He mentioned that he did not know he had won upon reaching the finish line, <b>thinking</b> <b>more</b> riders from the breakaway had crossed the line before him. Sagan was part of the breakaway on stage 10. He finished second to Michael Matthews and won the most combative award for his efforts. On the very next stage, Sagan broke away with yellow jersey wearer Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and his teammate Maciej Bodnar in the final kilometers. He outsprinted Froome to foil the sprinters' plans. After the stage, asked why he undertook such a daring move, he said: [...] "We are artists". Sagan claimed his 3rd victory by winning stage 16 in Bern, beating Alexander Kristoff in a sprint by few centimetres. He finished second to Greipel on the last stage in the Champs Élysées, securing his green jersey. He also was elected [...] "most combative" [...] rider of the whole Tour.|$|E
