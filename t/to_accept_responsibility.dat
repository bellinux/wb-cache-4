He {{undergoes}} surgery and the flirts with nurse Will Dempier (Christian Heath) when he suffers {{a reaction to}} the analgesic. Chris becomes frustrated when Hudson is not there for him, and questions how he can be in a relationship and feel so alone. He decides to ask Will out for a drink, but later cancels. Chris collapses due to complications from his surgery and is readmitted to hospital. He apologises to Will for cancelling on him and then tells him about Hudson. During Chris's next visit to Hudson, he appears distracted and when Hudson asks him if he is seeing someone else, Chris hesitates and Hudson breaks up with him.

25|$|Noda {{resigned}} {{as president of}} the DPJ <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for its defeat in the 2012 election. The resulting DPJ presidential election was held on 25 December 2012, which was contested by Kaieda and Sumio Mabuchi. It was eventually won by Kaieda with 90 votes to Mabuchi's 54 votes. It was suggested that his rise to the leadership could lead to cooperation with Ozawa, who had left the DPJ during 2012 due to Noda's pushing through of a consumption tax increase.|$|E

25|$|Existential – Existential {{psychotherapy}} postulates {{that people}} are largely free to choose {{who we are and}} how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.|$|E
25|$|In Joe Keller, Arthur Miller creates just a {{representative}} type. Joe {{is a very}} ordinary man, decent, hard-working and charitable, a man no one could dislike. But, like the protagonist of the ancient drama, he has a flaw or weakness. This, in turn, causes him to act wrongly. He is forced <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> – his suicide is necessary to restore the moral order of the universe, and allows his son, Chris, to live free from guilt and persecution. Arthur Miller later uses the Everyman in a criticism of the American Dream in Death of a Salesman, which {{is in many ways}} similar to All My Sons.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Army's officer-to-soldier {{ratio was}} {{extremely}} top-heavy, partially {{in order to}} compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following WorldWarII and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the soldiers' welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above). Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked round the clock, normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale amongst young officers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{reflection on}} the journey of completing a PhD by using emergent themes that occurred in supervision sessions as recorded in a reflective journal. The paper highlights the need <b>to</b> reflect and <b>accept</b> decisions that can be challenging. The paper also indicates examples where past understandings are questioned and newer insights have to be explored. A conclusion related <b>to</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>responsibility</b> for what happens {{as a consequence of}} supervision sessions is debated. Finally a new insight into identity is arrived at...|$|R

25|$|The {{conclusion}} contained many factual errors: eating {{fish and}} shellfish from {{other areas of the}} Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky {{explains}} {{his decision to}} focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway {{the population of the}} U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.|$|E
25|$|Although a British consul was {{resident}} in Central Africa from 1883, {{as late as}} 1888 the British Foreign Office declined <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> to protect the tiny British settlements there. Sharrer claimed to have purchased 363,034 acres in the area, and had attempted to induce chiefs to give up all their rights to their land. He may have intended to form his own Chartered company, or as Harry Johnston who was appointed as British consul in 1891 suspected, to acquire a form of sovereignty over the Shire Highlands and sell his rights either to Britain or Germany. Johnston rejected the suggestion that any treaties made before the British Central Africa Protectorate was established in 1891 could transfer sovereignty to Sharrer, but he accepted that these treaties were evidence of sales of land to him.|$|E

(Or, {{in the case of the}} dog, just, well, murder her.) Without her, though, the show wouldn't be half as interesting. Just when you think you've seen every bit of crazy Jenny can dish out, she digs deep and finds some new neuroticism. She's fragile, but she's steel-spined when it comes <b>to</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the havoc she wreaks in her life and everyone else's." ...|$|R

25|$|On many occasions, Doom’s {{only real}} {{weakness}} {{has been his}} arrogance. Layla Miller once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be {{the reason for his}} failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom’s continued refusal <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the accident that fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is generally unable to accept when others may {{have a better understanding of}} a situation than he does – with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as Mister Fantastic or the Thing when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain. For instance, while allied with Adam Warlock and other heroes against the Titan Thanos, he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated.|$|E
25|$|Rumors {{spread to}} Kamarpukur that Ramakrishna had become {{unstable}} {{as a result}} of his spiritual practices at Dakshineswar. Ramakrishna's mother and his elder brother Rameswar decided to get Ramakrishna married, thinking that marriage would be a good steadying influence upon him—by forcing him <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> and to keep his attention on normal affairs rather than his spiritual practices and visions. Ramakrishna himself mentioned that they could find the bride at the house of Ramchandra Mukherjee in Jayrambati, three miles to the north-west of Kamarpukur. The five-year-old bride, Saradamani Mukhopadhyaya (later known as Sarada Devi) was found and the marriage was duly solemnised in 1859. Ramakrishna was 23 at this point, but the age difference was typical for 19th century rural Bengal.They later spent three months together in Kamarpukur. Sarada Devi was fourteen while Ramakrishna was thirty-two. Ramakrishna became a very influential figure in Sarada's life, and she became a strong follower of his teachings. After the marriage, Sarada stayed at Jayrambati and joined Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar at the age of 18.|$|E

[...] The example stated {{is the use of}} passive speech by [...] "those who refuse <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their acts".

500|$|In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who {{effectively}} {{dropped out}} of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. [...] While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. [...] Wolters questioned Speer's readiness <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.|$|E

[...] Lucretia Mott then spoke, encouraging all {{to take up the}} cause. Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments in its entirety, then re-read each paragraph so that it could be discussed at length, and changes incorporated. The question of whether men's signatures would be sought for the Declaration was discussed, with the vote looking favorable for including men, but the motion was tabled until the following day when men themselves could participate. The first session adjourned at 2:30p.m.|$|E
