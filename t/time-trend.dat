40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether <b>time-trends</b> of enhanced [(18) F]Fluoromethylcholine ([(18) F]FCH) in lymph nodes (LN) {{of prostate cancer}} (PCa) patients can help to discriminate reactive from malignant ones, and whether single time point standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements also suffice. PROCEDURES: 25 PCa patients with inguinal (presumed benign) and enlarged pelvic LN (presumed malignant) showing enhanced [(18) F]FCH uptake at dual-phase PET-CT were analyzed. Associations between LN status (benign versus malignant) and SUV(max) and SUV(meanA 50), determined at 2 min (early) and 30 min (late) post injection, were assessed. We considered two <b>time-trends</b> of [(18) F]FCH uptake: type A (SUV early > SUV late) and type B (SUV late ≥ SUV early). Histopathology and/or follow-up were used to confirm the assumption that LN with type A pattern are benign, and LN with type B pattern malignant. RESULTS: Analysis of 54 nodes showed that LN status, <b>time-trends,</b> and 'late' (30 min p. i.) SUV(max) and SUV(meanA 50) parameters were strongly associated (P< 0. 0001). SUV(max) relative difference was the best LN status predictor. All but one inguinal LN showed a decreasing [(18) F]FCH uptake over time (pattern A), while 95 % of the pelvic nodes presented a stable or increasing uptake (pattern B) type. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Time-trends</b> of enhanced [(18) F]FCH uptake can help to characterize lymph nodes in prostate cancer patients. Single time-point SUV measurements, 30 min p. i., may be a reasonable alternative for predicting benign versus malignant status of lymph nodes, but this remains to be validated in non-enlarged pelvic lymph nodes...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{food demand}} {{scenarios}} {{are an important}} tool for studying global food security and for analysing {{the environmental impacts of}} agriculture. We provide a simple and transparent method to create scenarios for future plant-based and animal-based calorie demand, using time-dependent regression models between calorie demand and income. The scenarios can be customized to a specific storyline by using different input data for gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections and by assuming different functional forms of the regressions. Our results confirm that total calorie demand increases with income, but we also found a non-income related positive <b>time-trend.</b> The share of animal-based calories is estimated to rise strongly with income for low-income groups. For high income groups, two ambiguous relations between income and the share of animal-based products are consistent with historical data: First, a positive relation with a strong negative <b>time-trend</b> and second a negative relation with a slight negative <b>time-trend.</b> The fits of our regressions are highly significant and our results compare well to other food demand estimates. The method is exemplarily used to construct four food demand scenarios until the year 2100 based on the storylines of the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). We find in all scenarios a strong increase of global food demand until 2050 with an increasing share of animal-based products, especially in developing countries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Substance use {{and sexual}} risk {{behaviour}} affect young people's {{current and future}} health and wellbeing in many high-income countries. Our understanding of <b>time-trends</b> in adolescent health-risk behaviour is largely based on routinely collected survey data in school-aged adolescents (aged 15 years or less). Less is known about changes in these behaviours among older adolescents. Methods We compared two cohorts from the same geographical area (West of Scotland), surveyed in 1990 and 2003, to: describe <b>time-trends</b> in measures of smoking, drinking, illicit drug use, early sexual initiation, number of opposite sex sexual partners and experience of pregnancy at age 18 - 19 years, both overall and stratified by gender and socioeconomic status (SES); and {{examine the effect of}} <b>time-trends</b> on the patterning of behaviours by gender and SES. Our analyses adjust for slight between-cohort age differences since age was positively associated with illicit drug use and pregnancy. Results Rates of drinking, illicit drug use, early sexual initiation and experience of greater numbers of sexual partners all increased significantly between 1990 and 2003, especially among females, leading to attenuation and, for early sexual initiation, elimination, of gender differences. Most rates increased to a similar extent regardless of SES. However, rates of current smoking decreased only among those from higher SES groups. In addition, increases in 'cannabis-only' were greater among higher SES groups while use of illicit drugs other than cannabis increased more in lower SES groups. Conclusion Marked increases in female substance use and sexual risk behaviours have implications for the long-term health and wellbeing of young women. More effective preventive measures are needed to reduce risk behaviour uptake throughout adolescence and into early adulthood. Public health strategies should reflect both the widespread prevalence of risk behaviour in young people as well as the particular vulnerability to certain risk behaviours among those from lower SES groups. </p...|$|R

40|$|Congenital lung {{hypoplasia}} (LH) {{has been}} identified with increasing frequency in perinatal and neonatal necropsy reviews. The available prevalence figures have been derived using various diagnostic criteria in different populations and at various times. We therefore reviewed our experience in 15 years of consecutive early neonatal necropsies using one constant set of diagnostic criteria for LH and looked for a <b>time-trend.</b> We determined the necropsy prevalence (no. of cases of LH/no. of necropsies) and the birth prevalence (no. of cases of LH documented at necropsy per 1000 livebirths for inborn patients, and per 1000 referrals for outborn patients) between 1971 and 1985. We then divided this 15 -year period into five consecutive 3 -year periods {{to determine if a}} <b>time-trend</b> was discernible. Whereas early neonatal mortality for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions progressively decreased from 11. 4 % to 4. 0 % between the first and the last 3 -year periods, the number of cases of LH per 3 -year period did not vary appreciably. As a result, the prevalence of LH at necropsy showed a slight upward trend with time. The overall prevalence was 18 %; it was 13 % during the first and 23 % during the last 3 -year period. We found no <b>time-trend</b> in birth or referral prevalence for this lesion, which averaged 1. 1 per 1000 livebirths and 9. 8 per 1000 referrals.

The parallelism test was performed for evaluating similarities in trends in neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates by causes. Results. During the 1980 's, infant mortality rates in Mexico declined from 40. 4 to 31. 1 / 1 000 (ß= - 0. 791). Postneonatal mortality rates showed a strong decrease (ß= - 0. 892), while neonatal mortality rates were almost stationary (ß= 0. 089). Significant rate decreases were observed for Intestinal infections, Pneumonia and influenza and all other causes while Certain perinatal problems, Congenital defects and Nutritional deficiencies increased.

ResultsIn total, 7, 814 cases (ASR= 25. 66 / 1, 000, 000 habitants) of primary skin cancers in < 30 years old were diagnosed in 2000 - 2008. Females had a higher incidence of melanoma (risk ratio (RR) = 1. 95; P< 0. 001) and a lower risk of developing CSTS (RR= 0. 64, P< 0. 001). Compared to whites, blacks have a lower incidence of melanoma (RR= 0. 03, P< 0. 001), and higher risk of CSTS (RR= 2. 28, P< 0. 001). Melanoma increased in females over a 15 -year period (1992 - 2006) (APC= 2. 5, 95 %CI= 1. 8; 3. 2), and the incidence of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas increased over the period 1992 - 2008 (APC= 9. 5, 95 % CI= 6. 7; 12. 4). CSTS incidence decreased among males over the period 1992 - 1999 (APC=- 21. 4, 95 % CI - 27. 2; - 15. 1), particularly due to a decrease in Kaposi sarcoma incidence (AAPC 1992 - 2008 =- 13. 6, 95 % CI=- 22. 4;- 3. 8), although with a notable racial disparity (whites, AAPC=- 15. 2, 95 % CI=- 23. 2;- 6. 4; blacks, AAPC=- 10. 6, 95 % CI=- 13. 2;- 7. 9).
