We {{consider it as}} a model choice question with two models in competition: <b>one</b> for which <b>the</b> two expectations are equal and one {{for which they are}} different. The choice between the two models is performed through a Bayesian analysis, based on a robust choice of combined objective and subjective priors, set on the parameters space and on the models space. Three steps are necessary to evaluate the posterior probability of each model using two historical datasets similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Starting from <b>the</b> Jeffreys prior, a posterior using a first historical dataset is deduced and allows to calibrate the Normal-Gamma informative priors for the second historical dataset analysis, in addition to a uniform prior on the model space.

Bayesian and frequentist methods have been compared on simulated and real data. In accordance with FDA recommendations, control of type I and type II error rates has been evaluated.

40|$|Many {{classification}} problems {{must deal}} with imbalanced datasets where one class – the majority class – outnumbers the other classes. Standard classification methods do not provide accurate predictions in this setting since classification is generally biased towards the majority class. The minority classes are oftentimes <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> (e. g., when they are associated with pathological conditions in patients), so methods for handling imbalanced datasets are critical. Using several different datasets, this paper evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art classification methods for handling the imbalance problem in both binary and multi-class datasets. Different strategies are considered, including the one-class and dimension reduction approaches, {{as well as their}} fusions. Moreover, some ensembles of classifiers are tested, in addition to stand-alone classifiers, to assess the effectiveness of ensembles in the presence of imbalance. Finally, a novel ensemble of ensembles is designed specifically to tackle the problem of class imbalance: the proposed ensemble {{does not need to be}} tuned separately for each dataset and outperforms all the other tested approaches. To validate our classifiers we resort to the KEEL-dataset repository, whose data partitions (training/test) are publicly available and have already been used in the open literature: as a consequence, it is possible to report a fair comparison among different approaches in the literature.

40|$|Most {{methods for}} Personalized PageRank (PPR) precompute and store all {{accurate}} PPR vectors, and at query time, return <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> directly. However, the storage and computation of all accurate PPR vectors can be prohibitive for large graphs, especially in caching them in memory for real-time online querying. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework that strikes a better balance between offline indexing and online querying. The offline indexing attains a fingerprint of the PPR vector of each vertex by performing billions of "short" random walks in parallel across {{a cluster of}} machines. We prove that our indexing method has an exponential convergence, achieving the same precision with previous methods using a much smaller number of random walks. At query time, the new PPR vector is composed by a linear combination of related fingerprints, in a highly efficient vertex-centric decomposition manner. Interestingly, the resulting PPR vector is much more accurate than its offline counterpart because it actually uses more random walks in its estimation. More importantly, we show that such decomposition for a batch of queries can be very efficiently processed using a shared decomposition. Our implementation, PowerWalk, takes advantage of advanced distributed graph engines and it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by orders of magnitude. Particularly, it responses {{to tens of thousands}} of queries on graphs with billions of edges in just a few seconds. Comment: technical report of our full paper in CIKM 201...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to provide some insight into the {{relations}} that exist between cell level and message level performance guarantees in the context of ATM networks. Cell level guarantees are typically what the network is capable of providing, while message level guarantees are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to users. It is, therefore, important to understand how the two are related, and which factors influence this relation. There are many different performance measures that are of importance, and in this paper we try to touch on the (three) most relevant ones. This includes comparing cell and message loss probabilities, average cell and message delays, and cell and message jitter. Specifically, we show that cell and message loss probabilities can exhibit significant differences, which strongly depend on traffic characteristics such as peak rate and burst size, i. e., for a fixed cell loss probability, the message loss probability can greatly vary when peak rate and burst size change. One reason for this sensitivity, is that message loss depends on what happen to all the cells in a message. For delay and jitter, we also find that peak rate and burst size play a role in determining the relation between cell and message performance. However, this sensitivity is not as acute as with losses since message delay and jitter are typically determined by the performance seen by only one cell, the last cell in a message. In the paper, we provide quantitative examples that illustrate the range of behaviors and identify the impact of different parameters...|$|E

Finding the appropriate data is a crucial step of a research project. Researchers can contact the French Center for Socio-Political Data to obtain quantitative surveys. The CDSP data dissemination system includes platforms that allow data discovery (a question bank, a data discovery webviewer…) and data download. The several data dissemination platforms are not inter-operable. When we publish a new study, we have to publish it on each of the dissemination platforms. The consequences are a risk of de-synchronisation of the versions of the files. Besides this, the metadata is not entirely harmonised across waves/studies. Data labels may be different for the same question asked across time. In this context, researchers may encounter difficulties in finding the data they need.

The first is that the local axial velocity distribution is the same at all axial stations through the compressor. This approximation is {{made on the basis}} of the small opportunity for circumferential re-distribution within typical compressors. Order of magnitude arguments imply that it is most correct for disturbances with low order harmonic content, and these are precisely <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> here. Discussion of the assumption can be found in the papers by Dunham (1965) or Stenning (1980). Explicitly, the matching condition is M O, 6, Z) = ud(0, 6, £) where the subscript u refers to just upstream and d to just downstream of the compressor. The second matching condition is constant leaving angle at compressor exit. This is also an approximation, but it should be reasonable for the solidities of practical concern. The last matching condition can be expressed in terms of a relation between the pressure difference across the compressor and the local axial velocity and its derivative. As developed by Moore (1983) (see also Moore and Greitzer, 1986) the match-ing condition can be written in a linearized form as bPd-bP,u fdA 954 > d 8 ] pU &̣lt;j>J dd 3 €J (0 A O The quantity (d/d) is the slope of the steady-state com-pressor characteristic, and X and fi are nondimensional pa-rameters associated with the inertia of the fluid in the compressor blade passages.

The authors reported the values of longitudinal, radial and tangential (αt) coefficients of thermal expansion for two ranges of temperature variations, i.e., from 0 to 50  °C and from −[*] 50 to 50  °C. The coefficients showed a linear relation with density, but did not show significant changes for both [...] T ranges. For species characterized by a density comparable to Norway spruce, the species studied in the present work, Weatherwax and Stamm [4] reported the following values of αr: 23.8 [*]×[*] 10 − 6 K- 1  for Sitka spruce and 21.9 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1 for white fir with specific gravity at dry state (G 0) of, respectively, 420  kg/m 3 and 400  kg/m 3. The first systematic experimental work aimed to investigate the thermal expansion coefficient at different moisture contents and thermal ranges for several species was carried out by Kubler et al. [5]. In the thermal range 0 – 50  °C, αlon, αr and αt were studied for several species at three different moisture contents: dry state, 12 % MC and MC[*]>[*] 60 %. The coefficients showed a very heterogeneous behavior, as αr and αt were higher at 12 % MC than at dry state [5]. Nevertheless, the data seemed to be not perfectly in accordance with those of other authors, as very little difference in the values of αr and αt for the same species was measured. For example, αr and αt were, respectively, 24 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1 and 29 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1 for Douglas fir in the dry state [5], while Weatherwax and Stamm [4] found αr[*]=[*] 27.1 10 − 6 K- 1  and αt[*]=[*] 45 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1. The same for yellow birch was αr[*]=[*] 26 [*]×[*] 10 − 6 K- 1  and αt[*]=[*] 28 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1 [5] against αr[*]=[*] 32.2 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1 and αt[*]=[*] 39.4 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1 [4]. The value of αlon was very small, therefore any relevant difference was recorded between dry state and 12 % MC. Kubler et al. [5] also highlighted that at fiber saturation point (FSP), αr and αt were very small and negative (the specimens became smaller when heated) in the thermal range 0 – 65  °C; above 65  °C, α switched again to positive values. The same behavior was highlighted by Abe [6] who performed a wide research on the thermal properties of wood and wooden materials, but he worked near the glass transition temperatures of polymers, thus at temperatures much higher than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> for the present research. The negative value of α above the FSP was confirmed by Salmén [7]: below the softening point of lignin (63  °C), the thermal expansion coefficient of Norway spruce was negative, while above the softening point it was positive.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the strength of}} the association between antenatal psychosocial risk factors and adverse postpartum outcomes in the family, such as assault of women by their partner, child abuse, postpartum depression, marital dysfunction and physical illness. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cinahl, Famli, Psych Abstracts and the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials were searched from relevant articles published from Jan. 1, 1980, to Dec. 31, 1993, with the use of MeSH terms "depression, involutional," "child abuse," "child neglect," "domestic violence," "family," "marital adjustment," "family health," "newborn health," "child health," "physical illness," "social support," "psychosocial risk," "prediction," "risk factors," "obstetrics" and "prenatal care. " Further articles were identified from bibliographies. STUDY SELECTION: Of the 370 articles identified through the search, 118 were included for review. Studies were included if they examined the association between psychosocial risk factors and the outcomes of interest. Articles were excluded if they were reviews of poor quality or they had {{one or more of the}} following features: insufficient description of the sample, a high attrition rate, a lack of standardized outcome measures, outcomes other than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> or results that had already been reported in a previous study. DATA EXTRACTION: The strength of evidence of each study was evaluated. On the basis of the evidence, each risk factor was assigned a rating of the strength of its association with each of the postpartum outcomes. The ratings were class A (good evidence of association), class B (fair evidence) and class C (no clear evidence). Of the 129 antenatal psychosocial risk factors studied, 15 were found to have a class A association with at least one of the postpartum outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: Child abuse and abuse of the mother by her partner were most strongly correlated (class A evidence) with a history of lack of social support, recent life stressors, psychiatric disturbance in the mother and an unwanted pregnancy. Child abuse was also strongly associated with a history of childhood violence in the mother or her partner, previous child abuse by the mother's partner, a poor relationship between the mother and her parents, low self-esteem in the mother and lack of attendance at prenatal classes. Postpartum abuse of the mother was also associated with a history of abuse of the mother, prenatal care not started until the third trimester and alcohol or drug abuse by the mother or her partner (class A evidence). Child abuse had a fair (class B) association with poor marital adjustment or satisfaction, current or past abuse of the mother and alcohol or drug abuse by the mother or her partner. There was class B evidence supporting an association between abuse of the mother and poor marital adjustment, traditional sex-role expectations, a history of childhood violence in the mother or her partner and low self-esteem in the mother. Postpartum depression was most strongly associated with poor marital adjustment, recent life stressors, antepartum depression (class A evidence), but was also associated with lack of social support, abuse of the mother and a history of psychiatric disorder in the mother (class B evidence). Marital dysfunction was associated with poor marital adjustment before the birth and traditional sex-role expectations (class A evidence), and physical illness was correlated with recent life stressors (class B evidence). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial risk factors during the antenatal period may herald postpartum morbidity. Research is required to determine whether detection of these risk factors may lead to interventions that improve postpartum family outcomes...|$|E

The excitation current to a test battery is a sum of equal amplitude sin waves {{of a few}} frequencies spread over range <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The time profile of this signal has duration that is a few periods of the lowest frequency. The voltage response of the battery, average deleted, is the impedance of the battery in the time domain. Since the excitation frequencies are known, synchronous detection processes the time record and each component, both magnitude and phase, is obtained. For compensation, the components, except <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> are reassembled in the time domain. The resulting signal is subtracted from the original signal and the component <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is synchronously detected. This process is repeated for each component...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{demonstrate}} a rapid and economical ap-proach to deriving reference intervals, we analyzed data on plasma calcium and phosphate from a multichannel analyzer for more than 20 000 subjects and data on alkaline phospha-tase from more than 10 000 subjects. Subjects were selected by the criterion that their results for constituents other than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> were within current reference intervals. Thus {{we have been able}} to include older patients who have diseases that accompany old age, but that do not affect test results. The mean concentrations of calcium and phosphate decreased with increasing age in both sexes, except for an abrupt increase for women about the time of reaching menopause. Similarly, the mean alkaline phosphatase activi-ty increased with age in both sexes, reflecting a skewed frequency distribution. Here also, there was an abrupt in...|$|R
40|$|We {{compute the}} non–trivial {{infrared}} φ 4 3 –fixed point {{by means of}} an interpolation expansion in fixed dimension. The expansion is formulated for an infinitesimal momentum space renormalization group. We choose a coordinate representation for the fixed point interaction in derivative expansion, and compute its coordinates to high orders by means of computer algebra. We compute the series for the critical exponent ν up to order twenty five of interpolation expansion in this representation, and evaluate it using Padé, Borel–Padé, Borel– conformal–Padé, and Dlog–Padé resummation. The resummation Non–trivial fixed points are a highly challenging aspect of renormalization theory. Much of what is known about non–trivial fixed point is due to the ǫ–expansion of Wilson and Fisher [WF 72, WK 74], which is an interpolation from a critical dimension to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> In this paper we presen...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe last {{decades have}} been really hungry in new ways to reduce energy consumption. That is {{especially}} true when talking about wireless sensor networks in general and home multimedia networks in particular, since electrical energy consumption is the bottleneck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most energy-consuming functional block of an equipment is the radio front end, and methods to switch it off during the time intervals where it is not active must be implemented. This paper proposes a wakeup radio circuit which is capable of both addressing and waking up not only a more efficient but also more energy-consuming radio front end. By using a frequency footprint to differentiate each sensor, awaking all the sensors except for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is avoided. <b>The</b> particularity of the proposed wake-up receiver is that the decision is taken in the radio-frequency part and no baseband treatment is needed...|$|R
