5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E

5|$|This {{problem was}} first {{addressed}} by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> profile is linear because the fluid temperature is constant. When {{the upper and}} lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> profile is complicated, but it turns out it has an exact implicit solution.|$|E
40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the signal and group velocities for chirped optical pulses propagating through a GaAs cavity. <b>The</b> signal <b>velocity</b> {{is based on a}} specified signal-to-noise ratio at the detector. Under our experimental conditions, the chirp substantially modifies <b>the</b> group <b>velocity</b> of <b>the</b> pulse, but leaves <b>the</b> signal <b>velocity</b> unaltered. At unity transmittance, <b>the</b> <b>velocities</b> are equal. In general, when the transmittance is less than unity, <b>the</b> group <b>velocity</b> is faster than <b>the</b> signal <b>velocity.</b> While <b>the</b> group <b>velocity</b> can be negative, <b>the</b> signal <b>velocity</b> is always less than c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the refractive index of GaAs. To our knowledge, this is the first measurement of both <b>the</b> group <b>velocity</b> and <b>the</b> signal <b>velocity</b> in any system...|$|R

5|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the flow is that shear stress is {{constant}} throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of <b>the</b> <b>velocity,</b> , is constant. (This is implied by the straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (Newtonian fluid), the shear stress {{is the product of}} this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{similarity}} solutions to this equation {{have been found}} for various types of flow, including flat plate boundary layers. The term similarity refers to the property that <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> profiles at different positions in the flow are the same apart from a scaling factor. These solutions are often presented {{in the form of}} non-linear ordinary differential equations.|$|E
5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of an object; drag, which decreases <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies {{forces on the}} adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition.

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually {{and that the}} new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of money.|$|E

5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally is related to <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of the contact line. If <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{interfaces}} between {{regions with}} sharp differences in rotation {{are believed to}} be efficient sites for the dynamo processes that generate the stellar magnetic field.

25|$|Another {{apparent}} contradiction lies in {{the fact}} that <b>the</b> group <b>velocity</b> in anomalously dispersive media is higher than the speed of light.
