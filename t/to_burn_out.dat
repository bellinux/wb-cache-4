5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> the poison.|$|E
5|$|Multistage rocket: Although {{there is}} still some {{ambiguity}} as to whether the earliest rockets of the 13th century were first developed in Europe (i.e. 'ignis volantis in aere' in the work of Marcus Graecus around 1232, although Needham and Davis assert it was most likely a fire lance), the Middle East (i.e. 'sahm al-Khitāi' or 'arrows of China' as referred to by Hasan al-Rhammāh in 1280) or China (i.e. 'di lao shu' or 'ground rat' mentioned in 1264 or the 'chong' mortar used by the armies of the Song Dynasty and invading Mongols during the 1270s), during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) the term 'fire arrow' once implied to mean incendiary arrows during the Tang Dynasty was then used to describe the true rocket, producing a headache, as Needham says, for historians; the Huolongjing written by military officer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and the Song dynasty Chinese philosopher and politician Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) described several types of rockets, one of them being a multistage rocket known as the 'huo long chu shui' or 'fire dragon issuing from the water' which, despite its name, was not launched from beneath the water from a primitive submarine but rather at near water-level maintaining a flat trajectory; defined as a two-stage rocket, it employed booster rockets that, when about <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> of use, ignited a swarm of smaller rocket arrows fired from {{the front end of the}} missile shaped as a dragon's mouth.|$|E

Over the summer of 2009, Walcott participated in England under-21 team's 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship campaign despite protestations from his club manager, Arsène Wenger.

25|$|The {{filaments}} {{can burn}} out (fail) {{at the end}} of the lamp's lifetime, opening the circuit and losing the capability to heat up. Both filaments lose function as they are connected in series, with just a simple switch start circuit a broken filament will render the lamp completely useless. Filaments rarely burn out or fail open circuit unless the filament becomes depleted of emitter and the control gear is able to supply a high enough voltage across the tube to operate it in cold cathode mode. Some digital electronic ballasts are capable of detecting broken filaments and can still strike an arc with one or both filaments broken providing there is still sufficient emitter. A broken filament in a lamp attached to a magnetic ballast often causes both lamps <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> or flicker.|$|E
25|$|The Kings were title favourites {{following}} Round 5, having {{moved to}} a 5–1 record after a win over the Brisbane Bullets, with Lisch performing at an MVP level for the relaunched Kings. However, things began to deteriorate after that. The Kings' 'front-heavy' home schedule began {{to catch up to}} them, Steve Blake suddenly returned to the U.S. with a personal issue, and Lisch seemingly started <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>out.</b> By Round 11, the Kings had slipped from the top spot, and by Round 14 they were no longer among the top four. The Kings missed the finals in 2016–17 after losing nine of their final twelve games, finishing seventh on the ladder with a 13–15 record. Lisch appeared in 27 out of the Kings' 28 games, averaging 16.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.9 steals per game. His lone missed game came on October 30 against Brisbane due to a minor leg injury.|$|E

25|$|Wood-burners emit large {{quantities}} of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack. Many different types were fitted, the most common early type being the Bonnet stack that incorporated a cone-shaped deflector placed before {{the mouth of the}} chimney pipe, and a wire screen covering the wide stack exit. A more-efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> and fall to the bottom as ash. In the self-cleaning smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of deflector plates, angled {{in such a way that}} the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run. As with the arrestor, a screen was incorporated to retain any large embers.|$|E

Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun [...] "contract" [...] the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel , but in the verb [...] "contract" [...] the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to [...] Stress {{is also used to}} distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. <b>to</b> <b>búrn</b> <b>óut</b> versus a búrnout, and a hótdog versus a hót dóg.|$|E

500|$|Fire Management {{officials}} in Shoshone National Forest recognize that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem; however, this was not always the case. 20th century fire fighting efforts, especially {{in the first half of}} that century, emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, as fire was seen as completely detrimental to a forest. In 1935, fire management officials established the 10am rule for all fires on federal lands, which recommended aggressive attack on fires and to have them controlled by 10am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic. However, this policy led to an increase in fuels because fires were often extinguished before they had a chance <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> dead and dying old growth. It was in a stand of old growth fir trees in Shoshone National Forest that the Blackwater fire of 1937 killed 15 fighters during a firestorm [...] west of Cody, Wyoming. The fire was one of the deadliest in terms of forest firefighter deaths in U.S. history.|$|E
500|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{an active}} Fire Management Program which {{recognize}}s that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem, but this was not always the case. The 1987 forest plan did not recognize fire as an ecosystem process or as a tool for ecosystem management; this was rectified in the 2012 forest plan. Previous firefighting efforts, which emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, caused dead and dying trees to accumulate well in excess of the level found when fires are allowed <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> naturally. Historically speaking, fires became more common in parts of the SNRA after the development of lodgepole pine forests, which occurred prior to 1450AD. Between 1989 and 1998 there were on average 50 fires per year, with 58 percent of them caused by lightning. The Smoky Mountains of Idaho were named from the frequent forest fires, and in 2007 the Castle Rock Fire burned [...] of the Smoky Mountains near Ketchum. In 2005 the Valley Road Fire burned [...] in the White Cloud Mountains after being ignited from embers that came from a trash barrel which were blown out on a windy day. In August 2013 the Beaver Creek Fire and the Kelley Fire were both ignited by lightning and burned [...] and , respectively, of the Fairfield and Ketchum ranger districts. Another lightning-caused fire, the McCan Fire, burned [...] of the Fairfield Ranger District and other lands north of Fairfield in 2013. Both natural and prescribed fires are used as a tool to maintain desired vegetation and fuel levels. While the forest's fire plan operates within historical fire regimes, locally fire is actively suppressed to protect human life, investments, and resources.|$|E
