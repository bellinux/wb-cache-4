5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply {{believe that they are}} HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E

25|$|Early CIA efforts {{focused on}} LSD9/589, which later came to {{dominate}} many of MKUltra's programs.

Roma orders Williamson {{to not only}} continue to hand him the best leads, but to add half of Levene's commissions. Williamson tells Roma {{not to worry about}} it but Roma won't listen. Aaronow enters the office, desperate <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> found the perpetrators. Roma says no and heads out to the restaurant.|$|E
25|$|A Remembrall is a small, clear orb, {{about the}} size of a large marble, {{containing}} smoke that turns red when it detects that the person holding it has forgotten something. Unfortunately, it does not tell the holder what has been forgotten, which makes it somewhat worthless. The forgetful Neville Longbottom is sent a Remembrall by his grandmother in Philosopher's Stone. Remembralls are forbidden from being used during the O.W.L. exams, as they would enable students <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had written a wrong answer.|$|E
25|$|In the 80s and 90s before {{broadband}} Internet access became widely available, bootlegs (CD-Rs or Compact Cassette copies) circulated mostly via snail mail. Today, {{all of the}} unauthorised Led Zeppelin {{material is}} available on the Internet, mostly on BitTorrent resources in lossless media formats. Decoding and redistributing audio in lossy formats (such as MP3) is strongly frowned upon among the trading community as it diminishes the quality of the audio and can make it difficult for recipients <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are receiving the best available copy. During the 2000s, previously uncirculated audience recordings surfaced mostly on the BitTorrent resources.|$|E

25|$|Many {{adventure}} games {{make use}} of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode. Players are only {{able to pick up}} some objects in the game, so the player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important. Because it can be difficult for a player <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> missed an important item, they will often scour every scene for items. For games that utilize a point and click device, players will sometimes engage in a systematic search known as a pixel hunt. Games try to avoid this by highlighting the item, or by snapping the player's cursor to the item.|$|E
25|$|Terohaute's {{explanation}} was that Hood had been cleaning {{his gun and}} that it had gone off, shooting him through the head. The claim was self-evidently absurd; the rifle was too long for a man to shoot himself with, moreover Hood {{had been shot in the}} back of the head, apparently while reading a book. But with Terohaute stronger than them and armed, there was nothing John Hepburn and Richardson could do for the next three days, as Terohaute refused to let them out of his sight and became more and more aggressive, repeatedly asking <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought he had murdered Hood. Finally, on 23 October, Terohaute left them for a short time to gather lichen. Richardson took the opportunity to load his pistol, and on Terohaute's return, shot him dead.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lord {{had gone}} to the {{chartroom}} at 11:00p.m. to spend the night; however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10a.m. that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said {{that he did not know}} and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.|$|E
50|$|Krebsbach {{began by}} assuring the justices that {{arbitration}} could vindicate the petitioners' rights {{as well as}} a trial. The SEC, he said, had already suggested Wilko should be overruled in its McMahon amicus curiae brief. The justices wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if,</b> as <b>they</b> suggested, their claims should still be litigated even if the Court overruled Wilko because they had signed their agreements before McMahon. He believed they could be arbitrated since it would not be found prejudicial.|$|R

500|$|The homoerotic {{overtones of}} Barton's {{relationship}} with Charlie are not unintentional. Although one detective demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had [...] "some sick sex thing", their intimacy {{is presented as}} anything but deviant, and cloaked in conventions of mainstream sexuality. Charlie's first friendly overture toward his neighbor, for example, {{comes in the form}} of a standard pick-up line: [...] "I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink". The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also cited as an example of homoerotic affection. [...] "We consider that a sex scene", Joel Coen said in 2001.|$|E
500|$|In {{a display}} of both aspects of machismo, Trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo's machismo and {{treatment}} of women, [...] "e went to bed with his ministers' wives, not only because he liked these ladies {{but because it was}} a way to test his ministers. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were ready to accept this extreme humiliation. Mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque roleand they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death." [...] Trujillo's sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo. In Niessa's words, [...] "The implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1954 Alan Ross, a University of Birmingham {{professor}} of linguistics, devised the terms [...] "U" [...] and [...] "Non-U" [...] to differentiate the speech {{patterns of the}} social classes in England. [...] "U" [...] indicated upper-class usage, and [...] "Non-U" [...] the conventions of the lower strata of society. His article, in a learned Finnish journal and with an illustrative glossary, used [...] The Pursuit of Love [...] to exemplify upper-class speech patterns. In a spirit of mischief, Mitford incorporated the U and Non-U thesis into an article she was writing for Encounter on the English aristocracy. Although this aspect formed only a small section of Mitford's article, when {{it was published in}} September 1955 it caused a major stir. [...] Few recognised the tongue-in-cheek aspect; Mitford received hundreds of letters from [...] worried readers desperate <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were snobs or merely [...] "common". The level of anxious or amused interest was sustained {{to such an extent that}} in 1956 Hamish Hamilton reproduced the article in a short book, entitled Noblesse Oblige. The book also included an abbreviated version of [...] Ross's original article, and [...] contributions from Waugh, Betjeman, Peter Fleming and [...] Christopher Sykes, It was a tremendous success; as Lovell records, [...] "'U and Non-U' was the buzz phrase of the day... Nancy's comments made her the arbiter of good manners for several generations". Thompson notes the irony that the U and Non-U labels, perhaps Mitford's best-known legacy, were not her own but were borrowed for the purpose of a [...] "tease".|$|E

Civilisation is like the polish that beautifies inferior furniture, which water will wash off if it be but hot enough.

2500|$|Colin McGinn, {{an author}} and {{philosophy}} professor at the University of Miami, wrote in The New York Times that machines might eventually exhibit external behavior at a human-level, {{but it would be}} impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have an [...] "inner subjective experience" [...] as people do.

McGinn is skeptical of the Turing test, claiming it smacks of the long abandoned doctrine of behaviorism, and agreeing with the validity of Searle's [...] "quite devastating" [...] Chinese room argument. He believes minds do compute, but that it does not follow that computation alone can create a mind, instead he says minds have phenomenological properties, perhaps originating from organic tissue. Therefore, he insists that neither silicon chips nor any future technology Kurzweil mentions will ever be conscious.|$|E

On the same day, the German Foreign Office wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should send a telegram congratulating King Peter of Serbia on his birthday. Wilhelm replied: [...] "As Vienna has so far inaugurated no action of any sort against Belgrade, the omission of the customary telegram would be too noticeable and might {{be the cause of}} premature uneasiness...

[...] On 12 July, Szögyény reported from Berlin that everyone in the German government wanted to see Austria-Hungary declare war on Serbia at once, and were tired of Austrian indecision about whether to choose war or peace. He added that this:"absolute insistence on a war against Serbia was based on the two considerations already mentioned; firstly that Russia and France were 'not yet ready' and secondly that Britain will not at this juncture intervene in a war which breaks out over a Balkan state, even if this should lead to a conflict with Russia, possibly also France... Not only have Anglo-German relations so improved that Germany feels that she need no longer feel fear a directly hostile attitude by Britain, but above all, Britain at this moment is anything but anxious for war, and has no wish whatever to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Serbia, or in the last instance, Russia... In general, then, it appears from all this that the political constellation is as favourable for us as it could possibly be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Incentive theory distinguishes {{itself from}} other {{motivation}} theories, such as drive theory, {{in the direction}} of the motivation. In incentive theory, stimuli [...] "attract" [...] a person towards them, and push them towards the stimulus. In terms of behaviorism, incentive theory involves positive reinforcement: the reinforcing stimulus has been conditioned to make the person happier. As opposed to in drive theory, which involves negative reinforcement: a stimulus has been associated with the removal of the punishment—the lack of homeostasis in the body. For example, a person has come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> eat when hungry, it will eliminate that negative feeling of hunger, or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> drink when thirsty, it will eliminate that negative feeling of thirst.|$|R
