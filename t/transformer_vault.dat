5000|$|A {{somewhat}} separated area comprises several maintenance buildings. The Gas and Oil House building (...) uses coursed {{stone and}} heavy timber, with a porte-cochere {{extending from the}} front to shelter gas pumps. The <b>Transformer</b> <b>Vault</b> and Pump House (...) is similar in character. The Equipment Shed/Carpenter Shop (...) is a stone and frame building in a saltbox shape with projecting bracketed eaves that anticipate the Mission 66 style structures on the 1950s and 1960s. The Equipment and Supply Building (...) , measuring 199 ft by 32 ft is a masonry and frame building, with a large frame extension that burned in 1965.

5000|$|Buildings 48-1 through 48-5 were {{transformer}} houses. The city of Peru {{provided a}} 33,000 volt transmission line that fed a sub-station at {{the northeast corner}} of the base. The sub-station had three 500KVA step down transformers that took the voltage from 33,000 volt, 3 phase, 3 wire to 12,500 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire. Primary distribution was then by aerial or underground transmission to secondary distribution locations. There were [...] of overhead line, with [...] of bare copper wire; and [...] of underground line, with [...] of lead covered cable, [...] of fiber conduit encased in concrete and 58 manholes. To further step down the voltage for use in buildings, 18 transformer banks were utilized, with 67 oil insulated, air cooled <b>transformers</b> in <b>transformer</b> <b>vaults</b> and <b>transformer</b> houses, with a total capacity of 3,119 KVA volts. Standby emergency electricity was supplied by two [...] generators connected to two 12 cylinder gasoline engines.|$|R
5000|$|Transformers: Exodus - The Official History of the War for Cybertron is {{a science}} fiction {{adventure}} novel by Alexander C. Irvine. It revolves around the Transformers and {{the origin of the}} war and experiences prior to it. It was believed to be a possible prequel to Transformers: Prime as noted in the book <b>Transformers</b> <b>Vault</b> and verified as such in the Transformers: Prime episode [...] "One Shall Rise part 3", which references the entire book as part of a flashback into the way the war between the Autobots and Decepticons began. Exodus explores the backgrounds of Optimus Prime and Megatron within the Prime universe, showing how they came to be the leaders of their respective factions. The book also delves more heavily into the mythology of other well-known aspects of the Transformers characters and locations, such as Alpha Trion and The Fallen, whose original name is revealed in this story {{for the first time as}} Megatronus.|$|R
50|$|When it {{was still}} in use, the seven floors and the {{basement}} of the mill all had specific purposes. The basement held a <b>transformer</b> <b>vault,</b> water inlets, and an electrical room. On the first floor there was a small floor-mounted sifter, a larger ceiling-hung sifter, and a pressure tank. On the second floor there were conveyor belts and a staff lunchroom. The third floor contained more belts and bins and the fourth floor held a dust collector, centrifugal machine, gyration shifter, grinder, scale, and a packing bin. The fifth floor held a sifter, separator, and a centrifugal machine. The sixth floor held flour bins and the seventh floor was an electrical room.|$|E

40|$|The {{collaborative}} and low-cost {{nature of}} {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies used in today’s electric power systems. Recently, WSNs have been widely recognized as a promising technology that can enhance various aspects of today’s electric power systems, including generation, delivery, and utilization,making them a vital component of the next-generation electric power system, the smart grid. However, harsh and complex electric- power-system environments pose great challenges in the reliability of WSN communications in smart-grid applications. This paper starts with {{an overview of the}} application of WSNs for electric power systems along with their opportunities and challenges and opens up future work in many unexploited research areas in diverse smart-grid applications. Then, it presents a comprehensive experimental study on the statistical characterization of the wireless channel in different electric-power-system environments, including a 500 -kV substation, an industrial power control room,and an underground network <b>transformer</b> <b>vault.</b> Field tests have been performed on IEEE 802. 15. 4 -compliant wireless sensor nodes in real-world power delivery and distribution systems to measure background noise, channel characteristics, and attenuation in the 2. 4 -GHz frequency band. Overall, the empirical measurements and experimental results provide valuable insights about IEEE 802. 15. 4 -compliant sensor network platforms and guide design decisions and tradeoffs for WSN-based smart-grid applications...|$|E
5|$|Installation of Transformers: The Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood, {{required}} {{the removal of}} two attractions. On Sunday, April 11, 2010, Backdraft and Special Effects Stages closed. The Special Effects Stages were relocated to the Upper Lot and renamed the Special Effects Stage on June 26, 2010. Work began almost immediately {{on the construction of}} the ride. After a period of construction spanning close to two years, the ride and its gift store, the <b>Transformers</b> Supply <b>Vault,</b> soft opened to the public in late April 2012. Transformers: The Ride officially opened to the public on May 24, 2012.|$|R
25|$|By Wednesday, June 18, {{the waters}} had receded greatly, leaving {{remnants}} {{only in the}} Time Check neighborhood {{on the west bank}} of the river and the Czech Village district, which lies on both sides of the river. Importantly, most bridges had been reopened, relieving the stress on the I-380 which had been the only crossing that remained open (and only then with severe restrictions on who could cross). While downtown became accessible, power remained off, and traffic signals were out; this is because <b>transformers</b> in underground <b>vaults</b> were still receiving water. Water restrictions which imposed limits on use were also eased, and people were allowed the use of showers and washing machines.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{system of the}} future is going to be as much of a revolution to the electric energy industry as the wireless telephone has been to consumer communications. An electricity market transformation must occur before the changes can take place, but this evolution is already starting to occur {{in many parts of the}} country. In this paper, we discuss a vision for a future {{distribution system}}, areas that will be key for technology development, and the advantages of the new electricity market. Present day distribution systems are in a sense, unintelligent. Distribution systems respond to faults, or short circuits, by sensing the very high fault current and then opening circuit breakers to isolate the fault. Some newer automated systems determine fault location and then close other circuit breakers to provide an alternate path for power after the fault so that the number of customers left without power is minimized, but the extent of the reconfiguration is limited. Distribution systems also have some methods to regulate voltage, but there is little real time local response to contingencies such as loss of a transmission line or a generator. In present day distribution systems, there is very little control of load, or demand response, and Distributed Energy Resources (DER, distributed generation, storage, and responsive load) located in the distribution system are prohibited from even regulating voltage. In fact, industry standards and utility interconnection agreements typically require that when a contingency occurs on a distribution or transmission system that results in a voltage or frequency excursion, the DER is to disconnect rather than help. There is a pressing need to evolve the distribution system model to one that can respond to contingencies sensed locally, and has the local intelligence and autonomy to deal with contingencies such as unusual loading, transmission congestion, and line outages. Markets must be simple for customers to participate in the energy and reliability services transactions. In the future, distribution systems will have local monitors for current, voltage, and temperature at many locations such as substations, underground cable and <b>transformer</b> <b>vaults,</b> feeders and laterals. These monitors will input data to local agents. The local agents will be computers scattered throughout the distribution system constantly assessing system condition. The local agents will communicate quickly with their local sensors and with each other, and more slowly with status reports they send to the central control authority. The local agents will review temperature, current and voltage data and diagnose problems such as overloads, over/under voltages, and voltage presence on circuits that are supposed to be deenergized. They will also sense contingencies such as equipment outage due to faults. The local agents will be partially independent from central control and authorized to take corrective action when they diagnose problems. Some of the actions that will be taken will be local dispatch of DER, local capacitor connection, voltage regulator control, local circuit switching, and provision of local reliability services, such as load response. The local agents will report up to a central agent on a periodic basis. There will be several different types of local agents that will function together. One of the most important capabilities will be for the customers to participate in the energy and reliability services markets. With only a few exceptions, these markets are now only open to large generators and a few large loads. Reliability services, such as voltage regulation or reserve power, are much more effective when supplied locally at the load. In addition, local participation in these markets will provide demand elasticity in the load [...] something that is lacking now. At present, when power is scarce due to a contingency or severe weather, there is no customer response; customers continue to use the same amount because they do not see the market price. An elastic demand means that some customers would cut back during periods of shortage and high price. Elasticity in demand is essential for a healthy market system...|$|R
40|$|Autumn QuarterThe {{majority}} of the Autumn Quarter was spent developing a suitable program. This was impeded {{by the lack of}} specific verbage both from Dr. Michael and the Office of Extended Services, and the lack of data on the subject of Continuing Education for research purposes. The client had only an approximate idea of what he wanted, and could be specific in only the number of residential units and administrative offices. The site analysis was again hindered by lack of information. The size of the site was much larger than was needed, making it difficult to do detailed research. The schematics done during this period established the basic relationships, both horizontal and vertical, between general spatial categories. Winter QuarterAfter investigating various organizations it was decided that a lineal design was most appropriate. A strong central circulation spine would enable many differing spatial types and functions to be related to one another. In addition, mechanical systems and services would have their horizontal movement concentrated in this core. The initial scheme at mid-quarter was essentially linear with a series of activity nodes along the central spine. The spine was bent for the following reasons: 1. to provide closer physical relationships between the terminal areas of the spine; 2. to provide segregation of various spatial groups in terms of noise; and 3. to provide a semi-enclosed outdoor area. After re-examining the initial scheme, other lineal schemes were investigated. The lower twenty-acre portion of the site was decided the best location and more defined circulation and site zoning concepts were developed. The residential sector of the program, primarily because of privacy, was imposed over the other activity areas, and various schemes evolved. The final scheme incorporated a central spine terminated by entrances and registration areas for out of town and community and university participants. Administrative spaces, laboratories and studios, were organized {{on the north side of}} the spine; and the dining, recreation, and remaining conference and learning areas, on the south. Residential spaces were arranged on a single-loaded corridor. The corridor related to the spine and the rooms received southern sunlight. The auditorium and resource center are centrally located as is the service entrance. Spring QuarterThe largest part of the spring was expended in developing the mechanical, electrical and structural systems for the building. The heating system is a high velocity air system with air handling units distributed in the two central and two terminal equipment areas. Fifty-five degree air is supplied at 3000 feet per minute to attenuation/reheat/distribution boxes that are each controlled by separate thermostats. Air is returned at 1500 FPM. The residential floors are air-conditioned by fan-coil units in the individual spaces. The boilers, shillers, domestic hot water and incinerator are located in the central mechanical equipment spaces and two cooling towers are on the auditorium roof. The storm sewer runs along the central core west to the end of the building and south to Bethel Pike. The sanitary sewer comes in at the service entrance from McGalliard joining the building drain which runs along the central core. Electrical service is from the east end of the building and <b>transformer</b> <b>vault,</b> emergency generators and main switchboards are located at the east end of the basement. Panelboards are located in conjunction with the elevator towers and mechanical chases. The structural system consists of reinforced concrete bearing walls and precast concrete deck. The only exception to this is in the auditorium where the roof is framed with long span structural steel bar joists. The bearing walls gain lateral stability at the terminations of the linear core where they are turned out and in the stair and elevator towers where they are turned in and out again at the interior of the central core.
