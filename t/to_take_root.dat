5|$|Newport News' {{location}} next to Hampton Roads {{along with}} its rail network has provided advantages for the city. The city houses two industrial parks which enabled manufacturing and distribution <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root</b> in the city. As technology-oriented companies flourished in the 1990s, Newport News became a regional center for technology companies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root.</b> In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|Protestants had {{received}} services from itinerant ministers {{in the late}} 1790s, but the Spanish required them to move to American territory until after the Louisiana Purchase. After the purchase, the Baptist missionary John Mason Peck built the first Protestant church in St. Louis in 1818. Methodist ministers reached the town {{during the early years}} after the purchase, but only formed a congregation in 1821. The Presbyterian Church in St. Louis began as a Bible reading society in 1811, and in December 1817 members organized a church and built a chapel late the next year. A fourth Protestant group <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root</b> was the Episcopal Church, founded in 1825.|$|E

5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} force in the Everglades, shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. Starting at the last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades, eroding some of it away, and created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root,</b> and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root</b> in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|The Celtic Church is a {{term that}} has been used by {{scholars}} to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick. This form of Christianity later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root</b> in Scotland. The Celtic form of Christianity has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have a presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.|$|E

50|$|The {{people of}} Hyderabad were {{introduced}} to cricket by the British Army. Around 1880 cricket started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>roots</b> in the city. Mr.N.Ganesan, erstwhile Joint Secretary of Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) traced origins of serious cricket in the city by interacting with S.M.Hadi, S.R.Mehta, Nooh Abbasi, cricketers and organizers of yesteryears whose peers were the originators {{of the game in}} the city.|$|R
5|$|The {{result of}} {{different}} missions {{and forms of}} conversion {{was a series of}} overlapping and informally organised churches. In the past historians used the term Celtic Church to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick and which later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root</b> in Scotland.

5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone, eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root,</b> and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater {{came into contact with}} the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.|$|E

50|$|In Romania Access {{to public}} {{information}} is {{regulated by the}} Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), adopted in 2001. The information access principle is enshrined in Article 31 of the Romanian Constitution which provides that people's right of access to any information of public interest shall not be restricted and that public authorities shall be bound to provide correct information to the citizens in public affairs and matters of personal interests. However, despite {{the existence of a}} legal framework regulating access to public information and providing rules for its implementation, transparency has yet <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>roots</b> in Romanian institutional culture.|$|R

25|$|Following Sigmund Freud's {{pioneering}} work, ideas {{stemming from}} psychoanalytic theory also began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root</b> in psychiatry.

Several hundred Baltis migrated to the kingdom and according to oral tradition many Muslim traders were granted land to settle. Many other Muslims were invited over the following years for various purposes.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} of additional rail lines Brugg became an important rail junction. The Bözbergbahn to Basel opened on August 2, 1875, while the Aargauische Südbahn commissioned its line to Hendschiken on June 1, 1882. Despite these excellent transit links {{and the availability of}} land, industrial development was still slow <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root.</b> In 1864 a printing press opened {{on the site of the}} “Effingerhof,” the former town residence of the Habsburgs, which necessitated its demolition. Another prominent building, the Hallwylerfestung (Hallwyler Fortress), was torn down in 1883 and replaced with a schoolhouse. 1882 saw the development of a new water system and, beginning in 1896, a sewage system.|$|E
25|$|The third Protestant {{group to}} affect St. Louis was the Presbyterian Church, which was {{organized}} originally as a Bible reading society in 1811 by Charles Gratiot Sr., William C.

The fourth Protestant group <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>root</b> was the Episcopal Church, founded in 1825 when Thomas Horrell became the first rector of the Christ Church Episcopal Church. Regardless of the new churches and revival of Catholicism, however, most of the population was uninterested in organized religion or were agnostic.|$|E

50|$|These Malay {{settlers}} {{found the}} land fertile and agriculturally appropriate {{and the sea}} rich in marine resources. They established their settlement in this once vast unknown land. As more Malay settlers arrived from distant lands, more settlements were founded until even the upland regions of the peninsula were settled. The inhabitants had their own form of village government. They were ruled by a headman, a datu, or a sultan, in case of big encampments. Malay civilization began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>roots.</b> Rapid increase of population brought about the settlements of all the neighboring regions, {{that it did not}} take long before several nearby regions were inhabited later on to comprise the whole province of Kumintang, better known later as Batangas.|$|R
