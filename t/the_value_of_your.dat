30|$|Together with Raine Mäntysalo and Jonna Kangasoja, {{from the}} Aalto University, we started from a re-interpretation of Lindblom, {{not only as}} the proponent of a {{rationality}} based upon partisan mutual adjustment and partial agreements, but rather of a rationality based upon conflict and agonism (Mäntysalo et al. 2011). For Lindblom, in fact, it is not relevant {{whether or not you}} share, in general terms, <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> counterpart, {{as long as you are}} able to bargain on a concrete (planning) decision. What matters is whether your counterpart agrees with a concrete proposal, not why s/he agrees. If you move in this direction you can make sense of many failures in mutual understanding and of unexpected case specific opportunities even among actors in a situation of even radical conflict.|$|R
