5|$|The {{origin of}} the word walrus is thought by J.R.R. Tolkien <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> from a Germanic language, {{and it has been}} {{attributed}} largely to either the Dutch language or Old Norse. Its first part is thought <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> from a word such as Dutch walvis 'whale'. Its second part has also been hypothesized to come from the Old Norse word for 'horse'. For example, the Old Norse word hrossvalr means 'horse-whale' and is thought to have been passed in an inverted form to both Dutch and the dialects of northern Germany as walros and Walross. An alternate theory is that is comes from the Dutch words wal 'shore' and reus 'giant'.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{importance}} of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> general results.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data was used <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far {{greater number of}} spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates {{to compensate for the}} data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not the presence of other planets.|$|E

5|$|From its beginning, {{the main}} {{features}} of the metric system were the standard set of interrelated base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> larger and smaller units that could replace {{a huge number of}} other units of measure in existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{estimate of}} the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896.
