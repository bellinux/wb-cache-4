500|$|In February–March 1907, Andranik went to Vienna to {{participate}} in the fourth ARF Congress. The ARF, which had been associating with Turkish immigrant political groups in Europe since 1902, discussed and approved the negotiations with the Young Turkswho later perpetrated the Armenian Genocideto overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Andranik strongly denounced this cooperation and left the party. In 1908, the ARF asked Andranik to move to Constantinople and nominate his candidacy in the Ottoman parliament election, but he declined the offer, saying [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> do nothing". Andranik distanced himself from active political and military affairs for several years.|$|E
500|$|Stefani had an {{emotional}} breakdown from difficulties collaborating {{with many other}} artists and songwriters, so No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal invited her to his house. Kanal {{had been working on}} a track, which later became [...] "Crash", the sixth single from the album. However, the two were unable to write anything following that, because they had differing ideas of how the music should sound. Stefani commented that [...] "it was just frustrating and embarrassing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> think we could write songs." [...] Six months later, the two returned to work and came up with the beginnings of a song while working in Kanal's bedroom. The two experimented with combining various melodies and including what Stefani referred to as [...] "this really kinda fast rappy part". This was the last song she and Kanal wrote together for the album.|$|E
2500|$|Spitz felt snubbed by {{not being}} asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven gold medal record. [...] In an article, he is quoted as saying, [...] "I never got invited. [...] You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am[...] [...] [...] [...] I am going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? [...] That's almost demeaning to me. [...] It is not almost—it is." ...|$|E

[...] "We've got a bare {{majority}} {{on a full}} House; but you don't seem to dare to risk it. What {{are you going to}} do about it, Mr. Bass?" ...|$|R
60|$|As for me, I {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> very wet <b>and</b> weary, and a {{good deal}} anxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in my success.|$|R

Of course he'll grow used to it, and won't expect us <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> always <b>and</b> eat nothing. He thinks he's right, and perhaps he is. Flory will feel {{the weight of his}} displeasure; and if we talk to him we may persuade him." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Come Up Show following a recent performance in Canada in April 2011, Method Man replied with this regarding his current 'weed-loving' image: [...] "When you get older and you've got kids and your {{kids are going to}} school and you know [...] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [...] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. [...] "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into {{a cottage}} in Crear, Argyll and Bute, {{they set up}} a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and {{political}} territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, [...] "Then, of course, there's Travis and their album 12 Memories [...] You just have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> listen to it all the way through, and it will take you on a real journey. It's like an old album. It's like the Beatles' Revolver [...] Fran Healy's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful"—Elton John), singles such as [...] "Re-Offender" [...] did very well on the British charts, and the album itself reached No.3. Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn't mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band's decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I am so thankful," [...] she cried, [...] "so thankful! Francis, I ached--my heart ached <b>to</b> {{have you}} <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> talk as you did. Now I {{know that you}} are the man I thought you were. Francis, we will work together." ...|$|R
6000|$|She caressed my hand {{in silence}} for a little while, and then answered, [...] "I think you were right, Richard. Perhaps I am not capable of passion like some women. I felt--I knew that you were my friend. To be near you was like sitting {{in the shade of a}} green tree in some hot, desolate place. I thought it would be {{pleasant}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> always <b>and</b> forget the bitter years. But, Richard, if you will always be my friend--my brother, I shall be more than content, and my life will seem different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you seem}} dead-alive and tired. Let {{me try to}} enliven you by some {{wonderful}} tricks I have learnt, <b>to</b> kill time. <b>Sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> don't move." [...] She gathered up the pack of cards, pulled {{the table in front}} of her, and began to deal them rapidly, telling Elizabeth to choose some.|$|R
60|$|Seeing {{that she}} meant <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> that she {{apparently}} heard nothing, Bladud resumed the conversation {{where it had}} been interrupted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt so guilty <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{take the}} credit--your credit," [...] she told Josie afterwards, as they washed up the dishes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrong, mother! {{how could}} I help it? Was I going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> hear him talk of Frank's {{presumption}} {{as if he}} were a chimney-sweep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you talk}} to me like that, Sim Robinson--I won't have it. How do I know, indeed! How do YOU know what you know? Because {{somebody}} told you. You didn't invent it out of your own head, did you? Why, these twins are the truthfulest people in the world; and I don't think it becomes you <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> throw slurs at them when they haven't been doing anything to you. And they are orphans besides--both of them. All--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, {{you poor}} fish!" [...] said Nelly, {{completing}} her manoeuvres with the hat {{and turning to}} the cage. [...] "It's all right for you--you have a swell time with nothing <b>to</b> do but <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> eat seed--but how do you suppose I enjoy tramping around looking for work and never finding any?" ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Ford {{declined}} offers {{to run for}} either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House, which he called [...] "the ultimate achievement. <b>To</b> <b>sit</b> up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility, aside from the achievement, of trying to run the greatest legislative body {{in the history of}} mankind ... I think I got that ambition within a year or two after I was in the House of Representatives".|$|R
60|$|It {{was useless}} to dispute with her; and worse than useless <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> {{encourage}} her to say more. I got up on my feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Skim,--Now look here, Patsy Doyle, if you're going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> giggle you'll spoil everything. Mr. Clark {{wants to}} court, and it's getting late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man is impossible," [...] he proclaimed. [...] "It is {{obviously}} his intention <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> make himself a nuisance. Well, we {{get used to}} everything. I may get used to Richard Vont." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{the pirate}} had engaged a vessel {{of some sort}} was evident, and our hero, being {{naturally}} anxious to see if not {{to share in the}} fight, tried hard to get out of his prison, but without success. He was obliged, therefore, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> inactive <b>and</b> listen <b>to</b> the wild confusion overhead. At last there came a crash, followed by fiercer shouts and cries. He knew that the vessels had met and that the pirates were boarding. In a few minutes comparative silence ensued, broken only by occasional footsteps and the groaning of the wounded.|$|R
5000|$|Although Ghostzapper was {{primarily}} {{thought of as}} a sprinter, Frankel believed the horse might be able to handle longer distances. [...] "With the speed he showed, going long you might be able <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> with him <b>and</b> turn him loose in the stretch," [...] Frankel said. [...] "Everybody wants to pigeonhole him as a sprinter; we don't know. He's an easy horse to rate." ...|$|R
60|$|COLLINS. But even then, maam, {{why should}} we be held {{together}} when thats all over--when the girls are married and the boys {{out in the world}} and in business for themselves? When thats done with, the real work of the marriage is done with. If the two like to stay together, let them stay together. But if not, let them part, as old people in the workhouses do. Theyve had enough of one another. Theyve found one another out. Why should they be tied together <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> grudging <b>and</b> hating and spiting one another like so many do? Put it twenty years from the birth of the youngest child.|$|R
6000|$|He {{declared}} {{that he was not}} the least in a hurry. He desired nothing better, he said, than <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> talk to her. [...] "And I owe you a most sincere apology, Lady Arabella." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All this," [...] remarked Miss Castro, [...] "is very nice; and the Señor Maxwell, who is muy caballero, but somber sometimes, {{he is not}} here. You have my {{permission}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I will talk to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well for you <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> say `Hee! hee!'" [...] cried Alice, {{advancing}} to the fire-place; [...] "but you must have made a dreadful mark on your clean white frock. Get up and turn round." ...|$|E
6000|$|OLD MAN. [...] All over it: it did {{one good}} [...] To pass within ten yards when 'twas in blossom. [...] There was a sweet-briar too that grew beside.

[...] Ah I she was good to all! a woful day [...] 'Twas for the poor when to her grave she went! ...|$|R
50|$|A {{good example}} of a meydan {{can be seen in}} Ohrid, Macedonia. On two sides of the meydan in Ohrid, there are two mosques. In the centre of the meydan there is a çinar (plane tree) to shade one from the heat. <b>There</b> are places <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> is water <b>to</b> drink. One can deduce from the {{historical}} existence of the water source, the reason for existence of both the çinar and the meydan.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the first}} bedroom {{into which they}} entered they found Archie and Billie Sinclair, the latter seated comfortably in an arm-chair close to a window, the former wild with delight at the sudden demand on all his energies. For Archie {{had been one of}} the first to leap to the work when old McKay gave the order. Then he had {{suddenly}} recollected his little helpless brother, and had dashed round to Prairie Cottage, got him on his back, run with him to Ben Nevis Hall, placed him as we have seen in a position to view the field of battle, and then, advising him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> quietly <b>there</b> <b>and</b> enjoy the fun, had dashed down-stairs to resume his place in the forefront of battle! ...|$|R
60|$|They had {{now grown}} so hungry {{that they could}} have almost eaten each other. They felt they must get out of the cave and go to look for food. It would be better to be shot than <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> starve.|$|E
60|$|Pea's wisdom being indisputable, {{there was}} nothing for it but <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be blown through, for another half-hour. The water- rats {{thinking}} it wise to abscond {{at the end of that}} time without commission of felony, we shot out, disappointed, with the tide.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't humbug," [...] cried Clodd indignantly. [...] "She {{thought it}} was a bookcase--anybody would.

60|$|There is a {{ceremony}} when an old Cavaliere or the like, expires, of erecting {{a pile of}} benches in the cathedral, to represent his bier; covering them over with a pall of black velvet; putting his hat and sword on the top; making a little square of seats about the whole; and sending out formal invitations to his friends and acquaintances <b>to</b> come <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> hear Mass: which is performed at the principal Altar, decorated with an infinity of candles for that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Helms Foundation Hall of Fame in 1957, the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1958, and the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1961. [...] At the induction into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame, Steinmetz quipped, [...] "I won't have to talk about my records. Modesty forbids. They speak for themselves." [...] He also joked about having been overlooked in prior years: [...] "I'd been waiting for it since the first election of the board. The hardest thing I had <b>to</b> do was <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> wait <b>to</b> be called." ...|$|R
2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain things very much. I just tried to coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> watch him when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from that. I liked how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time. And then I read a book he wrote in 1965 called 'Practical Modern Basketball.'" ...|$|R
