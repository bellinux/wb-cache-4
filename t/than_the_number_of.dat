5|$|Demographics professors from Zagreb Faculty of Economics {{predict that}} the {{population}} will decrease by 350.000 people by 2030, based on current number of children born and people emigrating. Population going below 4 {{million people in the}} next 15 years can be avoided in only two ways - if 350.000 more people immigrate <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people who emigrate or if the number of children born almost doubles. Experts believe both options are unlikely.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|In the two-man {{bobsleigh}} competition, a tie {{meant that}} two gold medals were awarded, so no silver medal was awarded for that event. A tie for {{second in the}} men's Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded was one more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> silver or bronze medals. In snowboarding, Canadian Ross Rebagliati {{won the gold medal}} in the men's Giant Slalom, but it was briefly stripped by the IOC after he tested positive for marijuana. After the Canadian Olympic Association filed an appeal, however, the IOC's decision was overturned.|$|E

5|$|On October 5, 2004, Aladdin was re{{released}} onto VHS and for {{the first}} time released onto DVD, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdin's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3million units in its first month, but it was less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> copies, sold in that amount of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels.|$|E
5|$|Overclaiming in {{aerial warfare}} is not uncommon. During the Second World War, pilots often claimed more {{aircraft}} shot down than {{was actually the}} case. The Air Ministry released a press statement on 15 September that 175–185 German aircraft had been shot down. The actual number of aircraft destroyed was ⅔ lower and significantly less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> German losses on 15 and 18 August (The Hardest Day), in which the Luftwaffe lost 75 and 69 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 purse {{was set at}} $150,000, {{but fewer}} than 15 mushers {{finished}} the race that year, meaning the money allotted for the final two prizes were distributed {{to each of the}} 13 mushers who finished. The purse peaked at $200,000 in 2007, and winner Lance Mackey took home $40,000. In 2014, the purse was $115,000, but only 11 mushers finished the race, fewer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> paying positions. Rather than distribute the extra money to the finishers, the race chose to roll over the unused prize money into the 2015 race. As a result, the 2015 Yukon Quest will have a purse of more than $127,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E
5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced {{both the}} inner and the outer walls, {{and a number of}} smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E
5|$|There are 41 macroinvertebrate taxa {{that have}} been {{observed}} in West Creek, more than have been observed in all of upper Fishing Creek.

Site WC2 has a macroinvertebrate density of 600 macroinvertebrates per square meter.

5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
5|$|Japan has full {{religious}} freedom based on Article 20 of its Constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 {{percent of the}} Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> true believers. The number of Shinto shrines in Japan {{is estimated to be}} around 100,000. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70–80% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs. Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas.|$|E
5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E
