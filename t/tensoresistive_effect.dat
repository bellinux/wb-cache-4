For the samples corresponding to chemical composition with thallium concentration x ~ 0. 0025 an essential increase of the <b>tensoresistive</b> <b>effect</b> in compari-son with nondoped samples is observed; i. e., resistance changes for elastic elongations per unit length of a crystal.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} tensoeffect mechanisms in neutron transmutation doped (NTD) n-Si(P), the <b>tensoresistive</b> and tense-Hall <b>effects</b> were investigated in highly strained crystals with phosphorous concentration 3 x 10 (13) - 7. 2 x 10 (14) cm(- 3) and under different doses of gamma -radiation (up to 8 x 10 (17) quanta/cm(2)). It was determined that according to the defect structure and its corresponding energy level within the band gap, an appreciable decrease of the activation energy {{of different types of}} radiation-induced defects and accompanied increase of the concentration of free electrons occur in different range of uniaxial pressure. The mechanism indicated above together with the intervalley redistribution of electrons (Smith-Herring mechanism) and pressure dependence of the f-scattering probability determine tensoeffect peculiarities which were investigated in highly strained NTD and gamma -irradiated Si(P).

40|$|The {{change of}} {{electrical}} resistivity depending on mechanical loading applied (the <b>tensoresistive</b> and piezorezistive <b>effect)</b> in polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon nanoparticle composites (nanocomposites) is experimentally studied. Dependence of the electrical resistance on time, strain and stress is examined. High structure carbon nanoparticles (mean diameter 30 nm, dibuthyl phthalate adsorption 380 ml/ 100 g, specific surface 950 m 2 /g) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) {{have been used}} as the filler. Solvent based mixing technology before curing for sample preparation is used. Finally the mechano-electric properties of different composites are compared and functional models of both piezo and tenzoresistive effect are proposed and practical usage fields are discussed as well. Conclusions are made, that multi wall carbon nanotube composites can be used as strain sensing elements at smaller strain ranges comparing with carbon black filled ones. On other hand they have certain resistivity “memory effect” during large (more than few %) strain deformations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} an added {{plasticizer}} on {{the change of}} electrical resistance under deformation at both stretch and compression is studied in polyisoprene composites containing dispersed nano-size conducting carbon particles at concentrations {{in the vicinity of}} the percolation threshold. A giant change of the electrical resistance (by more than 4 orders of magnitude) has been earlier observed at both stretch (<b>tensoresistive</b> <b>effect)</b> and compression (piezoresistive effect) of the composite containing 10 mass parts of carbon. The addition of plasticizer to the initial materials increases the strain sensitivity of the composite and broadens the carbon concentration interval of the percolation threshold. The observed improvements of the strain-resistance response are explained by two effects: 1) decrease of cohesion forces between carbon nanoparticles and 2) higher mobility of the carbon nanoparticles in the elastomer matrix in the presence of the plasticizer. The fatigue of <b>tensoresistive</b> <b>effect</b> as a result of cyclic tensile stresses was tested by means of a special home-made testing machine arranged with a LoggerProTM digital multi purpose data acquisition unit...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} several years, the {{macroscopic}} electric and elastic properties of conductive polymeric composites have been studied {{from the viewpoint of}} such applications as thermistors and pressure sensors. In particular, we studied carbon black ŽCB. polymeric nanocomposites on macro- and nanoscales, using polyisoprene as the composite matrix. The filler component was an extra conductive carbon blackŽPRINTEX XE 2, DEGUSSA. with a primary particle diameter of about 30 nm. A very strong reversible <b>tensoresistive</b> <b>effect</b> of electric resistance dependence on uniaxial tension deformation was observed in composites with the 10 carbon black mass parts added to 100 mass parts of polyisoprene. A conductive-type atomic force microscopeŽAFM. was used for the mapping of carbon black conductive network into an insulating matrix, while for studying the nanomechanical properties of composites, a tapping mode atomic force microscope was applied. A correlation between macroscopic and nanoscopic—both electric and elastic—properties was observed...|$|E
