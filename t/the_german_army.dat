5|$|Six {{weeks after}} D-Day, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy on 6 June 1944, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> was in turmoil. While the Allied Army experienced great difficulty in {{breaking through the}} German lines (the city of Caen {{was supposed to have}} been captured on the first day of the invasion and was not taken until late in July) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was expending irreplaceable resources. The Allied air forces controlled the skies (up to 100km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing Axis troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive were in the midst of destroying <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> Group Centre. In France, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the 20 July plot—in which officers of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army,</b> including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little trust between Hitler and his generals.|$|E
5|$|The plan {{to begin}} Operation Fredericus in April {{led to more}} forces being {{allocated}} {{to the area of}} the German 6th Army. Unknown to the Soviet forces, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>army</b> was regrouping in the center of operations for the offensive around Kharkov. On 10 May, Paulus submitted his final draft of Operation Fredericus and feared a Soviet attack. By then, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>army</b> opposite Timoshenko was ready for the operation towards the Caucasus.|$|E

5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>army.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 20 October, {{the naval}} {{operations}} were effectively over; the Russian ships {{had been destroyed}} or forced to withdraw, and <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>army</b> held their objectives.

5|$|During {{the course}} of their advance through Belgium, the Germans {{committed}} a number of war crimes against the Belgian civilian population along their route of advance. These massacres were often responses to towns whose populations were accused of fighting as Francs-Tireurs or guerillas against <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>army.</b> Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as The Rape of Belgium. As many as 6,500 people were killed by <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>army</b> between August and November 1914. In Leuven, the historic library of the town's university was deliberately burned. News of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable sympathy for the Belgian civilian population in occupied Belgium. The sympathy for the plight of Belgian civilians and Belgian refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

For ten years, Kellner openly campaigned against the Nazis until they came to power in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Misch {{received}} a call-up notice for military service. In Offenberg, {{he joined the}} SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT), the predecessor to the Waffen-SS, instead of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> as the SS-VT did not require Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service) time.

5|$|In the south, the Second Panzer Army {{initially}} advanced towards Tula {{with relative}} ease because the Mozhaisk defense line {{did not extend}} that far south and no significant concentrations of Soviet troops blocked their advance. However bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges eventually slowed <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>army,</b> and Guderian did not reach the outskirts of Tula until 26 October. The German plan initially called for the rapid capture of Tula, followed by a pincer move around Moscow. The first attack, however, was repelled by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers on 29 October, after a fight {{within sight of the}} city. On 31 October, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> high command ordered a halt to all offensive operations until increasingly severe logistical problems were resolved and the rasputitsa subsided.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that out of 39,000 Jews in the country only 9,000 survived; the rest were either killed or deported to Germany, both by the local authorities and <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> itself. Croatian and Serbian sources disagree on the exact figures.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} German veterans, Göring was {{a proponent of}} the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the {{civilian}} leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> {{began their}} offensive, as predicted, on 5 July 1943, under the codename Operation Citadel. The Soviets succeeded in {{limiting}} {{them to a}} slow advance. In <b>the</b> north, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> 9th <b>Army</b> advanced south from Orel. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> failed to breach the main defence lines, stalling at the third belt. <b>The</b> <b>German</b> <b>armies</b> {{had been forced to}} commit their mobile reserves to the breakthrough. This allowed the Soviets to conduct the operational and offensive phase of their plan; Operation Kutuzov. Striking the 2nd Panzer Army, the Soviet's fresh operational forces, heavily mechanized, threatened to cut off <b>the</b> <b>German</b> 9th <b>Army.</b> Had they succeeded, nothing would have stood between the Red Army and the strategic depth of <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> Group Centre's front. However <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were able to stem the advance by committing their mobile reserves and organize a withdrawal. Still, <b>the</b> two <b>German</b> <b>armies</b> had been worn down, and the Soviet forces in the north had won the strategic initiative.|$|R
5|$|Most of the British and German {{dead from}} the Battle of Mons were {{initially}} buried in church and local cemeteries in Mons and surrounding villages {{rather than a}} purpose built military cemetery.

5|$|Nevertheless, the now-outnumbered Belgians {{abandoned}} Brussels and the Government fled to Ostend. The {{city was}} occupied by <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> on 17 May.
