5|$|Bridge to Terabithia was {{released}} to positive reviews; critics {{called it a}} faithful adaptation of the children's novel, and found dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhanced <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> film. Bridge to Terabithia was nominated for seven awards, winning five at the Young Artist Awards.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> {{character}} designs {{and use of}} advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.|$|E

5|$|While not an {{illustration}} in itself, Christopher Nevinson’s statement against {{the slaughter of}} World War I in his painting Paths of Glory (1917) takes its title from another line in the Elegy, “The paths of glory lead but to the grave”. The title had already been used two years before by Irvin S. Cobb in an account of his journalistic experiences {{at the start of}} that war. It was then taken up in the unrelated Humphrey Cobb's 1935 anti-war novel, although in this case the name was suggested for the untitled manuscript in a competition held by the publisher. His book also served in its turn as the basis for Stanley Kubrick’s film Paths of Glory, released in 1957. This example is just one more among many illustrating <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> currency that certain lines of the poem continue to have, over and above their original significance.|$|E

In the TV series, he breaks the fourth wall by talking about Lola to the viewers, and also narrates the episodes as well.|$|E
25|$|The four-string banjo is {{used from}} time to time in musical theater. Examples include: Hello, Dolly!, Mame, Chicago, Cabaret, Oklahoma!, Half a Sixpence, Annie, Barnum, The Threepenny Opera, Monty Python's Spamalot, and countless others. Joe Raposo had used it variably in <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> 7-piece {{orchestration}} for the long-running TV show Sesame Street, and has sometimes had it overdubbed with itself or an electric guitar. The banjo is still (albeit rarely) in use in the show's arrangement currently.|$|E

25|$|Clair's {{reputation}} as a film-maker underwent a considerable reevaluation {{during the course of}} his own lifetime: in the 1930s he was widely seen as one of France's greatest directors, alongside Renoir and Carné, but thereafter his work's artifice and detachment from the realities of life fell increasingly from favour. The avant-gardism of his first films, and especially Entr'acte, had given him a temporary notoriety, and a grounding in surrealism continued to underlie much of his comedy work. It was however <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> manner in which he overcame his initial scepticism about the arrival of sound which established his originality, and his first four sound films brought him international fame.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} background and erudition {{of her family}} members served to ignite <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> faculties of Schiaparelli’s impressionable childhood years. She became enraptured with the lore of ancient cultures and religious rites. These sources inspired her to pen a volume of poems titled Arethusa based on the ancient Greek myth of the hunt. The content of her writing so alarmed the conservative sensibilities of her parents they sought to tame her fantasy life by sending her to a convent boarding school in Switzerland. Once within the school’s confines, Schiaparelli rebelled against its strict authority by going on a hunger strike, leaving her parents to see {{no alternative but to}} bring her home again.|$|E
25|$|Further {{details were}} absorbed from <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> retellings by Greil Marcus and Robert Palmer. Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson {{received}} his gift {{from a large}} black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail {{was attached to the}} Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography Crossroads, by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician Tommy Johnson. This story was collected from his musical associate Ishman Bracey and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s. One version of Ledell Johnson's account was published in David Evans's 1971 biography of Tommy Johnson, and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside House's story in the widely read Searching for Robert Johnson, by Peter Guralnick.|$|E

25|$|Other {{well-known}} vase {{painters of}} the time are the Painter of the Vatican Mourner, The Princeton Painter, the Painter of Munich 1410 and the Swing Painter (540-520 BC), to whom many vases are attributed. He is {{not considered to be}} a very good artist, but his figures are unintentionally humorous because of the figures with their large heads, strange noses and frequently clenched fists. The work of the Rycroft Painter bears a resemblance to red-figure vase painting and the new forms of expression. He liked to depict Dionysian scenes, horses and chariots, and the adventures of Heracles. He often uses outline drawings. The approximately 50 usually large-size vessels attributed to him are elegantly painted. The Class of C.M. 218 primarily decorated variations of the Nikosthenic amphoras. The Hypobibazon Class worked with a new type of belly amphora with rounded handles and feet, whose decoration is characterized by a key meander above the image fields. A smaller variant of neck amphora was decorated by the Three Line Group. The Perizoma Group adopted around 520 BC the newly introduced form of the stamnos. Toward the end of the century, high quality productions were still being produced by the Euphiletos Painter, the Madrid Painter and <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> Priam Painter.|$|E

500|$|Miyazaki's films often {{emphasize}} environmentalism and the Earth's fragility. Margaret Talbot {{stated that}} Miyazaki dislikes modern technology, and believes much of modern culture is [...] "thin and shallow and fake"; he anticipates {{a time with}} [...] "no more high-rises". Miyazaki felt frustrated {{growing up in the}} Shōwa period from 1955–65 because [...] "nature — the mountains and rivers — was being destroyed in the name of economic progress". Peter Schellhase of <b>The</b> <b>Imaginative</b> Conservative identified that several antagonists of Miyazaki's films [...] "attempt to dominate nature in pursuit of political domination, and are ultimately destructive to both nature and human civilization". Miyazaki is critical of capitalism, globalization, and their impacts on modern life. He believes that [...] "a company is common property of the people that work there".|$|E
500|$|The Disasters of War is {{the second}} of Goya's four major print series, which {{constitute}} almost all of his most important work in the medium. He also created 35 prints early in his career—many of which are reproductions of his portraits and other works—and about 16 lithographs while living in France. Goya created his first series, the 80-plate Caprichos, between 1797 and 1799 to document [...] "the innumerable foibles and follies {{to be found in}} any civilized society, and... the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual." [...] Caprichos was put on sale in 1799, but was almost immediately withdrawn after threats from the Inquisition. In The Disasters of Wars first two groups of prints, Goya largely departs from <b>the</b> <b>imaginative,</b> synthetic approach of Caprichos to realistically depict life-and-death scenes of war. In the last group, the Caprichos sense of the fantastic returns.|$|E
500|$|Knight Lore atmosphere, which Sinclair User {{described}} as a [...] "crepuscular world of claustrophobic menace", inspired many curious questions {{on the part of}} the adventurer in contemporaneous 1985 reviews. Crash appreciated <b>the</b> <b>imaginative</b> mystery of the game as they attempted to answer why Sabreman turns into a werewolf, who they preferred to play as, and what the collectible objects throughout the castle do. Sabreman's werewolf transformation sequence, in particular, annoyed CVG and traumatised players, according to Well Played, a book of academic close readings of video games, as players empathised with the suffering Sabreman. The game design gave the impression that the castle was far grander in scale than it was in reality, and Crash wrote that the game's novel eight-way direction scheme suited the 3D space. Crash compared Knight Lore stylistically to the 1984 Avalon, but suggested that the former had bolder visuals. The magazine preferred Knight Lore to its predecessor (Underwurlde) and one critic even considered the former to be Ultimate's best game.|$|E
