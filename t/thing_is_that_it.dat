5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that the important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> saved Josh Underwood.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 14 March 2010, {{speaking}} to {{residents in the}} Bolnisi region, Saakashvili appeared to defend the broadcast, and stated [...] "(i)t was indeed a very unpleasant program, but the most unpleasant <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is extremely close to what can happen and to what Georgia's enemy has conceived". The {{only part of the}} fake report that Saakashvili specifically objected to was the part which said that some of the Georgian Army had joined jorces with the Russians, as it is according to Saakashvili an insult to those who are fighting for Georgia. However, during the Mukhrovani Mutiny Saakashvili called the same soldiers traitors and accused them of working for Russia. Military expert Giorgi Melitauri accused those behind the Mukhrovani Mutiny; those who carry out Saakashvili's propaganda orders; of being behind the writing of the programme. On 15 March 2010, a written statement appeared on the Georgian President's website, in which, aside from accusing Russia of having aggressive plans against Georgia, he called for higher journalistic ethical standards to prevent such incidents in the future.|$|E

He stated that his personal assumption <b>is</b> <b>that</b> past measurements have misgauged the Rydberg constant and that the official proton size for hydrogen is inaccurate.|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} {{of the theory of}} Portuguese discovery of Australia owes much to Melbourne lawyer Kenneth McIntyre's 1977 book, The Secret Discovery of Australia; Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook. McIntyre's book was reprinted in an abridged paperback edition in 1982 and again in 1987 and it was found on school history reading lists by the mid-1980s. According to Dr. Tony Disney, McIntyre's theory influenced a generation of history teachers in Australian schools. A TV documentary was made of the book in the 1980s by Michael Thornhill and McIntyre and the theory featured in many positive newspaper reviews and articles over the next twenty years. Australian history school textbooks also reflect the evolution of acceptance of his theories. The support of Dr. Helen Wallis, Curator of Maps at the British Library during her visits to Australia in the 1980s seemed to add academic weight to McIntyre's theory. In 1987, the Australian Minister for Science, Barry Jones, launching the Second Mahogany Ship Symposium in Warrnambool, said [...] "I read Kenneth McIntyre's important book... as soon as it appeared in 1977. I found its central argument... persuasive, if not conclusive." [...] The appearance of variant but essentially supporting theories in the late 1970s and early 1980s by other writers, including Ian McKiggan and Lawrence Fitzgerald also added credence to the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia. In 1994, McIntyre expressed pleasure that his theory was gaining acceptance in Australia: [...] "It is gradually seeping through. The important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that...</b> <b>it</b> has been on the school syllabus, and therefore students have... read about it. They in due course become teachers and... they will then tell their students and so on".|$|E

50|$|The team {{experienced}} a low in their performances when it won just {{one out of}} the final six matches, just enough to secure the third place. But the good <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> earned them a ticket for the next UEFA Cup tournament and restored some pride in the team. Rivaldo had scored 21 goals that campaign while another new signing, Songo'o, won the Trofeo Zamora.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2007, the Islamic Army {{engaged in}} an armed {{conflict}} against al-Qaeda in Iraq. In June, this ended in a ceasefire between the two rival groups. The IAI was quoted saying [...] "The most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> our common duty to fight the Americans;" [...] nevertheless, the groups never adopted al-Qaeda's philosophy and refused {{to sign on to}} the al-Qaeda-led Islamic State of Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The {{season of}} 2002 shaped the future. The team {{reached the top}} division. It also reached the finals of the National Cup and gained the chance {{to take part in}} the UEFA Cup. But the most {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> also got new owners who were determined to create a normally functioning and financially predictable club. The European campaign of that year added some good emotions to the general hype.|$|R
