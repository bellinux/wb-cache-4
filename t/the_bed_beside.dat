25|$|The Second Book of Enoch {{contains}} a section, called Exaltation of Melchizedek, {{which says that}} Melchizedek was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of Noah. The child came out from his mother after she had died and sat on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek {{was taken by the}} archangel Gabriel (Michael in some manuscripts) to the Garden of Eden and was thus preserved from the Deluge without having to be in Noah's Ark.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} Ivar Kreuger {{was in the}} United States and was asked to return to Europe {{for a meeting with}} the {{chairman}} of the Riksbank, Ivar Rooth. He had left Sweden for the last time on November 23, 1931 and returned to Europe on the ship Ile de France, arriving in Paris on March 11, 1932. The meeting with Ivar Rooth was scheduled to take place on March 13 or 14 in Berlin. He met with Krister Littorin (vice president of Kreuger & Toll holding) and his own banker Oscar Rydbeck in Paris on March 11 to prepare for the Berlin meeting. But on March 12, he was found dead in bed in his apartment at Avenue Victor Emanuel III. After questioning Kreuger's servants (his French maid, Mademoiselle Barrault, and the janitor who had had contact with Kreuger in the morning) the French police and a physician {{came to the conclusion that}} he had shot himself some time between 10:45a.m. and 12:10p.m. A 9-mm semi-automatic gun was found on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> the body.|$|E
2500|$|The Second Book of Enoch (also called [...] "Slavonic Enoch") is {{apparently}} a Jewish sectarian {{work of the}} 1st century AD. The last section of the work, the Exaltation of Melchizedek, tells how Melchizedek was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of Noah. The child came out from his mother after she had died and sat on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood.

60|$|Later on, strolling with Possum on {{the main}} deck, as I passed {{the open door of}} the {{hospital}} I heard the muttering chant of O'Sullivan, and peeped in. There he lay, lashed fast on his back in the lower bunk, rolling his eyes and raving. In the top bunk, directly above, lay Charles Davis, calmly smoking a pipe. I looked for the marlin-spike. There it was, ready to hand, on <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|R
25|$|During a {{campaign}} speech, Walcott is shot {{and ends up}} in a coma with a bullet lodged in his brain. While watching {{the results of the}} election on the news, the campaign team celebrates its win just as Walcott dies in <b>the</b> hospital <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> them.|$|R
60|$|It was my comrade of the crimp waggon, {{his huge}} broad face looming {{out from under}} a white nightcap, and ensconced in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, old scout," [...] greeted Blair, as he {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> Lane. [...] "I need you more than any one--but it kills me to see you." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she fell}} upon {{the floor in}} a faint. Mr. Wells and Jim lifted her on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> Edwards, where they {{endeavored}} to revive her. It was some moments before she opened her eyes.|$|E
60|$|The old Scotswoman {{refrained from}} uttering her {{belief that he}} knew only too well, {{but by the time}} all this had been said Barbe was obliged to leave them, having {{arranged}} for the night that Eleanor should sleep in <b>the</b> big <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her sister, and their lady across it at their feet--a not uncommon arrangement in those days.|$|R
50|$|Subject-verb {{inversion}} in English {{is a type}} of inversion {{where the}} subject and verb (or chain of verbs, verb catena) switch their canonical order of appearance, so that the subject follows the verb(s), e.g. A lamp stood <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> → <b>Beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> stood a lamp. Subject-verb inversion is distinct from subject-auxiliary inversion because the verb involved is not an auxiliary verb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Sammy, Sammy, {{speak to}} me, my dear boy--speak to your old father!" [...] he cried, turning again to <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and {{kneeling}} <b>beside</b> it; but the drunken sleeper did not move.|$|R
6000|$|Janet {{regarded}} the child wistfully. [...] "I {{hoped it would}} be a boy," [...] she said. [...] "He would have had--a better chance." [...] But she raised her arms, and the child was laid in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E
60|$|Holmes {{had brought}} up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.|$|E
60|$|And as John Clayton {{wrote the}} last words his hand was destined ever to pen, he dropped his head wearily upon his outstretched arms where they rested upon the table he had built for her who lay still and cold in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} briefly, {{and added that}} we {{expected}} he would recover consciousness after the operation, for a short time, at all events. He went at once {{and sat down on}} the edge of <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> with Godalming <b>beside</b> him. We all watched in patience.|$|R
50|$|The mountainous zone {{consists}} {{of a string of}} mountains that extend east to west, south of the coastal zone. The zone has many dry river beds and valleys between the mountains. <b>The</b> river <b>beds</b> provide permanent water in terms of springs and shallow wells dug in <b>the</b> dry river <b>beds.</b> <b>Besides</b> human and livestock consumption, the water sources are used for the irrigation of fruit and vegetable farms. Unlike the other zones of the region, the Mountainous zone has reliable water sources in the region.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of an electrochemically generated gas phase on the hydrodynamic {{characteristics of a}} three-phase system has been examined. The two-phase fluid, (gas-liquid), in which the liquid phase is the continuous one, flows through a packed bed with glass spheres. The {{influence of}} the liquid velocity was examined, {{as well as the}} gas velocity and particle diameter on the pressure drop through <b>the</b> fixed <b>bed.</b> It was found that with increasing liquid velocity (wl = 0. 0162  0. 03 m/s), the relative pressure drop decreases through <b>the</b> fixed <b>bed.</b> With increasing current density, the pressure drop increases, since greater gas quantities stay behind in <b>the</b> fixed <b>bed.</b> <b>Besides,</b> it was found that with decreasing diameter of the glass particles, the relative pressure drop also decreases. The relationship betweeen the experimentally obtained friction factor and the Reynolds number was established...|$|R
6000|$|... "Max," [...] said he, {{sitting down}} on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> me, [...] "I mean {{to start this}} {{afternoon}} {{on a visit to}} the mountain fort. You know I promised Macnab that I would look him up about this time and fetch Waboose and her mother back." ...|$|E
6000|$|To-night {{he had not}} snapped, and for {{the first}} hour or two he lay remarkably still, until at last Mary heard him {{rattling}} his bunch of keys against the tin box which he always kept in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> him. About three o'clock he said, with remarkable distinctness, [...] "Missy, come here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I badly wounded?" [...] she asked. [...] "Do {{you think}} that I am going to die?" [...] The tremor in her voice was pathetic--it {{was the voice of}} a frightened and {{wondering}} child. Bridge heard the boy behind him move impulsively forward and saw him kneel on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> the girl.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} door and, walking swiftly to <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> knelt <b>beside</b> it and covered {{his face with his}} hands. His hands were cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why was he {{kneeling}} there like a child saying his evening prayers? To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, flesh, benumbed and weary.|$|R
60|$|Azinte crept {{softly to}} <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> knelt down <b>beside</b> {{it and put}} her arms so softly round Obo that she {{scarcely}} moved him, yet she gradually drew him towards her until his head rested on her swelling bosom, and she pressed her lips tenderly upon his brow. It was an old familiar attitude which seemed to pierce the slumbers of the child with a pleasant reminiscence, and dissipate his malady, for he heaved a deep sigh of contentment and sank into profound repose.|$|R
60|$|Back {{she went}} again to <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> {{kneeling}} down <b>beside</b> Leo, {{and in the}} intense silence which followed--for he had ceased his mutterings--I thought that I could hear the beating of her heart. Now she began to speak, very low and in that same bastard Greek tongue, mixed here and there with Mongolian words such as are common to the dialects of Central Asia. I could not hear or understand all she said, but some sentences I did understand, and they frightened me not a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi! {{get off of}} me, you rascal!" [...] spluttered the professor, and thrashed around wildly. [...] "Get off of me! Who are you, anyway?" [...] and then, as he got {{a better}} sight of the animal, which at that moment leaped up on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> his mate, he turned and sat up in amazement.|$|E
60|$|She would not, as Violet entreated, {{lie down}} on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her, but {{remained}} seated on the floor, her eyes riveted on the fire, never looking round, her face stupefied, her hands hanging motionless, like one stunned; and when Violet's anxious gaze was closed by irresistible sleep, that dark head was still motionless before the fire.|$|E
60|$|So {{they passed}} to <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> the discontented bee, and here upon the softest down lay the dove, whose gentle eyes looked gratefully upon the Fairy, as she knelt beside the little couch, {{smoothed}} the soft white bosom, {{folded her arms}} about it and wept sorrowing tears, while the bird still whispered its gratitude and love.|$|E
5000|$|Glenough is very scenic, and hill-walking may {{be pursued}} in this area. There {{are a number}} of forests in Glenough, which consist mainly of {{coniferous}} trees and completely cover most of the hill tops. Some of these forests have been planted and maintained by the Irish state forestry agency - Coillte, while other forests have been planted by local farmers with the help of government grants. Deciduous trees are also present, especially in Aughnaclanny Valley. Wild fallow deer live in the forests of Glenough. The Aughnaclanny River flows through Glenough, and is most easily visible at the bridge beside Glenough's former National School. It still stocks trout, and up to recently, salmon were still returning to spawn in <b>the</b> gravel <b>beds</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> school. Aughnaclanny Valley is a Special Area of Conservation due to the alluvial wet woodlands, yew woods, and floating river vegetation associated with the lower course of the River Suir and its tributaries. Aughnaclanny Valley is also a proposed National Heritage Area.|$|R
30|$|The {{genesis of}} a {{reservoir}} {{is a result}} of the combined action of deposition, diagenesis, tectonic reworking, and interaction of rock and fluid and the evolutionary environment. We discuss the genetic and evolution mechanism of a low-permeability reservoir <b>bed</b> of <b>the</b> Xujiahe Formation in the western Sichuan Depression on the basis of the study of diagenesis, diagenetic reservoir facies and the diagenetic evolution sequence. The research indicated that this reservoir bed can be divided into five types of diagenetic reservoir facies, namely strong dissolution, chlorite-lined intergranular pores, compaction and pressure solution, carbonate cementation and secondary quartz increase. There are, however, just two diagenetic reservoir facies which provide low-permeability reservoir beds, namely strong dissolution and chlorite-lined intergranular pores. We also analyzed their diagenetic evolution sequences and the origin of <b>the</b> low-permeability reservoir <b>bed.</b> <b>Besides,</b> it was also indicated that the composition and structure of sandstones, types of sedimentary microfacies, diagenesis history as well as the tectonic reworking in later periods are the main factors controlling the formation of <b>the</b> low-permeability reservoir <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> abovementioned factors establish the foundation for the forecasting the distribution of high quality reservoir beds.|$|R
50|$|The losgann came to {{the door}} and told her to {{remember}} her pledge. First she put him behind the door, then under a bucket, then in a little <b>bed</b> by <b>the</b> fireplace, then a <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her own <b>bed,</b> but nothing stopped him. Finally, he told her to take down a rusty sword behind <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and cut off his head. She did, and he became a handsome young prince, who married her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cease your titles, Knave," [...] exclaimed Abi, [...] "and listen, for I need counsel, {{and if you}} cannot give it I {{will find}} one who can. Just now I lay on my bed asleep, and a dreadful vision came to me.

60|$|Now {{all this}} while Asmund sat deep in thought; but when, at length, men were sunk in sleep, {{he took a}} candle of fat and passed to the shut bed where Swanhild slept alone. She lay on her bed, and her curling hair was all about her. She was awake, for the light gleamed in her blue eyes, and on a naked knife that was on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her, half hidden by her hair.|$|E
60|$|He {{stretched}} {{himself on}} <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> his brother, {{and it seemed}} to him that it was hardly a second before he heard a loud crash that shook the whole house; and the room looked full of fire. Another crash came, and then another, with a loud, stony kind of rolling noise that seemed to go round the world. Then he knew that he had been asleep, and that this dreadful noise was the swift coming of a thunder-storm.|$|E
6000|$|... "There need be no {{fear about}} him. He never wakes till the bell rings, and sleeps like a top. Why, he didn't wake, the other morning, {{when we had}} a {{scrimmage}} and you tumbled out of <b>bed.</b> <b>Besides,</b> we all sleep {{at the other end of}} the room and, even if he did wake up in the night, he wouldn't notice that we had gone; especially if we shoved something in <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> to make a lump.|$|R
50|$|Alem's father {{takes him}} to London, England, under {{the pretext of}} a holiday to {{celebrate}} his fourteenth birthday. They stay in a hotel in Datchet, Reading, and his father takes Alem sightseeing in London. They finish the day with an Amharic goodnight. Then, Alem wakes up and looks over to <b>the</b> empty <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> him and thinks he is at breakfast, but he finds that he has left him alone with a letter. The letter says that he and Alem's mother will continue to fight for peace with the organization EAST and that they hope one day Alem can rejoin them. Mr. Hardwick allows Alem {{to stay for a}} few days and on the final day he brings in the Refugee Council who send Alem to a children's home. His time at the home is violent and disturbing as a rude boy Sweeny decides to beat him up and he tries to run away but ends up back at the home. He is then moved to london and placed in a foster family (the Fitzgerald's). Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald are a professional foster family. Ruth, their teenage daughter, seems unhappy with Alem. Alem returns from his first day at school, where he has made two friends, Robert and Buck, to discover a letter from his father indicating his mother has gone missing.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} current {{biomaterials}} clinically applied as stems, femoral heads and acetabular cups of total hip prosthese {{has been made}} {{with regard to their}} mechanical properties, corrosion behaviour and wear resistance. The successful implantation and the life cycle of an endoprosthesis is highly dependent on its connection to <b>the</b> bone <b>bed.</b> <b>Besides</b> <b>the</b> problem of mechanical loading of the prosthesis and the change of the strain condition in cortical bone, the stresses in the bone cement, which act as a force-transmitting element, are of considerable importance. Inadequate cementing technique is often the reason for the loosening of the endoprosthesis. An alternative way of fixation of an endoprosthesis to cementing is the biological connection by the ingrowth of bone into the implant surface. Despite the increasing use of orthopaedic implants, there is still a lack of adequate testing procedures and legal guidelines for testing. Modern testing methods, techniques for the calculation of stresses and life cycle predictions applied during the development and manufacturing phases of standard and special implants, may ensure an adequate prosthetic life cycle with a particular emphasis on the biomedical optimization of the interface implant/bone and the surrounding bone. The mismatch concept applied to the system bone/implant as a composite model is a possible way to optimize biofunctionality and biocompatibility with regard to extending the prosthetic life cycle.
