500|$|In December 2012, {{the chain}} was criticized in China {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that a number of KFC suppliers had been using growth hormones and an excessive amount of antibiotics on its poultry in ways that violated Chinese law. In February 2013, Yum! CEO David Novak admitted that the scandal had been [...] "longer lasting and more impactful <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> imagined." [...] The issue is of major concern to Yum!, which earns almost half of its profits from China, largely through the KFC brand. In March 2013, Yum! reported that sales had rebounded in February, but that lower sales in December and January would result in a decline in same-store sales of 20 percent in the first quarter.|$|E
500|$|The 3D {{cameras were}} unable to pick up {{anything}} shiny, such as stainless steel, due to a flare. Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are [...] "slow to pick up information". Loucks said, [...] "It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, and we thought that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light. [...] So we had to add more and more black. [...] The reason I say it's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> have before." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Roberto Orci explained {{in an interview that}} the big reveal {{at the end of the}} episode, in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe, was actually planned for a fourth season, but the writers decided [...] "let's actually answer something instead and not get, not just rely on that mystery forever. And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> intended". The writers wanted to use an iconic image [...] for the scene, leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg's suggestion of the Twin Towers. Wyman first thought it was [...] "the greatest idea in the world" [...] before having doubts that its use would [...] "sensationalize" [...] it. He explained, [...] "But then, when we started thinking about it, we thought collectively America really understood 9/11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn’t exploited but indicative of the times we’re living in right now. We used it and that was the end of the first season and then we were all really thrilled with where it was going." [...] The cast would later recollect on the series, and for Jackson, considered that the show has never [...] "had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger" [...] as this finale.|$|E
500|$|While Michael Cerveris has {{appeared}} as the Observer {{in the three}} previous episodes—and {{has appeared}} in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was [...] "one of several nuggets dropped in" [...] by J.J. Abrams {{in a manner similar}} to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was [...] "this sort of Where's Waldo thing (as) the linchpin in an overarching story of the series". He continued: Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> expected." [...] The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, [...] "I've got a little too much else going on, and who knows if they would ever grow back. I have little enough hair as it is." [...] "The Arrival" [...] was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.|$|E

As a result, the game sold well, with Schafer stating that they sold more copies of Psychonauts in the first few hours of the Bundle's start than they had since the release of the retail copy of the game.

In The Inner World of Farm Animals, Goodall writes that farm animals are [...] "far more aware and intelligent <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> imagined and, despite having been bred as domestic slaves, they are individual beings {{in their own}} right. As such, they deserve our respect. And our help. Who will plead for them if we are silent?"

[...] In 2012, a group of well known neuroscientists {{stated in the}} [...] "Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness in Non-Human Animals" [...] that all mammals and birds (such as farm animals), and other animals, possess the neurological substrates that generate consciousness {{and are able to}} experience affective states. Eugene Linden, author of The Parrot's Lament, suggests that many examples of animal behavior and intelligence seem to indicate both emotion and a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{returned}} to the UK from the United States in August 1976, Slade found themselves out-of-favour {{at the time of}} the UK's Punk rock explosion. The band's 1977 album Whatever Happened to Slade proved a commercial failure while their tour that spring had shown that they could no longer fill large venues. Slade's waning success soon led to the band taking any gig they could. They found themselves playing small venues, mainly universities and clubs. The band's tours often ran at a loss, with the band having to bring their own PA and lightshow. Bassist Jim Lea however was unphazed. [...] "I still thought the band was great," [...] he told Chris Charlesworth in 1983, [...] "We were playing as well if not better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> had... now we had something to prove again." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Christian Post on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as {{being part of the}} prosperity gospel.

I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed of.

In December 2011, Draco and the Malfoys played their last show at the Yule Ball. On December 19, 2011, they posted this message on their Facebook page: [...] "Thank you for making our final two shows this weekend completely amazing. It's been an unbelievably gratifying 6+ years.

On December 19, the band officially released the first single [...] "Coming Home" [...] from the untitled album. In January 2017, Radke began performing guitar for the band. On January 20, 2017, the band announced their next album Coming Home, which was released on April 7. Around the time of its release, it was rumored that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band, and now has a new band with Dallon Weekes of Panic! at the Disco entitled I Don't Know How But They Found Me. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member.|$|E

2500|$|Before the conference, Smuts met Lord Kitchener at Kroonstad station, {{where they}} {{discussed}} the proposed terms of surrender. Smuts {{then took a}} leading role in the negotiations between the representatives from all of the commandos from the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (15–31 May 1902). Although he admitted that, from a purely military perspective, the war could continue, he stressed the importance of not sacrificing the Afrikaner people for that independence. He was very conscious that 'more than 20,000 women and children have already died in the concentration camps of the enemy'. He felt it would have been a crime to continue the war without the assurance of help from elsewhere and declared, [...] "Comrades, we decided to stand to the bitter end. Let us now, like men, admit that that end has come for us, come in a more bitter shape <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> thought." [...] His opinions were representative of the conference, which then voted by 54 to 6 in favour of peace. Representatives of the Governments met Lord Kitchener and at five minutes past eleven on 31 May 1902, Acting President Burger signed the Peace Treaty, followed by the members of his government, Acting President de Wet and the members of his government.|$|E
