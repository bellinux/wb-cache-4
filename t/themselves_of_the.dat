5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} the millions of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid <b>themselves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail <b>themselves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{protection}} afforded by Article 12(2) {{may try to}} argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind <b>themselves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
5|$|Such {{a retreat}} {{was not an}} option in the face of another of Aberhart's troubles. One of Social Credit's 1935 {{promises}} had been the introduction of recall for MLAs, which they had implemented with their first legislative act. As Aberhart's popularity fell, the residents of his own Okotoks-High River riding, where he had been elected in a by-election shortly after the general election (in which he had not run), availed <b>themselves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislation. On April9 their petition was endorsed by the riding's Social Credit constituency association, and by fall it had gathered the signatures of the required two thirds of the electorate. In response, the Social Crediters repealed the Recall Act retroactive to its date of origin; Aberhart claimed that oil companies active in his riding had intimidated their workers into signing the petition, and that some of the signatories had moved to the area specifically to sign.|$|E
5|$|The truce of Hudaybiyyah was {{enforced}} for two years. The {{tribe of}} Banu Khuza'a had {{good relations with}} Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans. A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also {{took part in the}} fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow <b>themselves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.|$|E

5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to <b>themselves.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E
