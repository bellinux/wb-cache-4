5|$|The tomb of Ramesses IX, KV6, {{has been}} open since antiquity, {{as can be}} seen by <b>the</b> <b>graffiti</b> left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors.

The tomb extends a total distance of 105 metres into the hillside, including extensive side chambers that were neither decorated nor finished. The hasty and incomplete nature of the rock-cutting and decorations (it is only decorated for a little over half its length) within the tomb indicate that the tomb was not completed by the time of Ramesses' death, with the completed hall of pillars serving as the burial chamber.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of November 19, <b>the</b> <b>graffiti</b> on the {{exterior}} of the 5 Pointz building was painted white, providing images that showed the building's previously graffiti-covered walls partially covered in white paint. A message posted to 5 Pointz's Twitter account on the morning of November 19 confirmed the reports. Despite a lawsuit filed by 5 Pointz proprietors, as well as a rally three days prior to gain petition signatures to protect the building from demolition, the sudden whitewashing indicated that it was already gone. However, on November 20, a ruling by a federal judge stated that the whitewashing could result in the Wolkoff family having to pay damages to 5 Pointz artists.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, {{artists whose}} works had been {{featured}} at 5 Pointz filed a federal lawsuit against Jerry Wolkoff, {{stating that the}} destruction of the building violated the 1990 Visual Artists Rights Act, and that they did not receive the notice of the building's demolition 90 days in advance. This came after federal judge Frederic Block of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled that the artists could have a jury trial, as opposed to a bench trial where only judges would hear the artists' and Wolkoff's arguments. The trial, which began in mid-October 2017, was seen as an important case since it would decide whether graffiti could be categorized as art that could be federally protected. In November 2017, a jury recommended that Block issue a verdict that Wolkoff's destruction of <b>the</b> <b>graffiti</b> was illegal.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the city's {{graffiti}} epidemic surged {{to levels}} never seen before; nearly every subway car was tagged with graffiti {{by the end}} of the year. It was aided by the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor John Lindsay declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, but it would be a while before the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture. The MTA tried rubbing <b>the</b> <b>graffiti</b> off with an acid solution, but maintaining the cars to keep them relatively graffiti-free was costing them around $1.3 million annually. In winter 1973, the car-washing program was stopped. In September 1974, exterior washing with an acid solution started, but the solution was found to have caused more harm than good.|$|E
