30|$|<b>The</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> RTA is {{expected}} to generate various implications for agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and exporting member countries.

In this context, several studies (e.g., Krugman, 1991; Frankel, 1997; Perdikis, 2007) noted that reductions in regional and bilateral trade barriers would not only decrease market prices, but would also compel firms in RTAs’ member countries to upgrade their production technologies and to realize more efficient uses of inputs.|$|R
