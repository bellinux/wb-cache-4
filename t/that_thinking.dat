5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> about feelings inhibits automatic responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of {{an automatic}} process.|$|E
5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises <b>that,</b> <b>thinking</b> himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E

5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E

25|$|Computationalism is the {{position}} {{in the philosophy of}} mind that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.|$|E
40|$|Introduction We often know <b>that</b> we are <b>{{thinking}},</b> {{and what}} we are thinking about. Here ‘thinking’ is not supposed to be an umbrella term for cognition in general, but should be taken in roughly the sense of ‘a penny for your thoughts’: mental activities like pondering, ruminating, wondering, musing and daydreaming all count as thinking. In the intended sense of ‘thinking’, thinking is not just propositional: in addition to <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> p, there is thinking of (or about) x. Belief is necessary but not sufficient for <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> p: <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> p entails believing that p, but not conversely...|$|R

He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the Red Skull, acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1968, Oughton and Ayers {{became part}} of the Jesse James Gang, which banded {{together}} with about 40 others against the moderates. The Jesse James Gang replaced the University of Michigan SDS chapter, and Robbins, Oughton, and Ayers worked in partnership with Jim Mellen from the Revolutionary Youth Movement Group. The Vietnam War entered its third year in the middle of 1968. The early student movement had taken their moral stance from the teachings of Albert Camus, who taught <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> men have the responsibility to find a way in the world to be neither a victim or the executioner. Four events in 1968 turned the American student movement into self-proclaimed Marxist–Leninist revolutionaries: the Viet Cong's Tet Offensive, the student sit-in at Columbia University, the near-revolution in France, and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Each event helped change the way American radicals viewed their own situations.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have criticized}} REBT for being harsh, formulaic {{and failing to}} address deep {{underlying}} problems. REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working {{on the basis of}} the client’s point of reference. They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions. Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined. REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds. In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes <b>that</b> <b>thinking,</b> feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{critical}} thinking has been featured in nursing literature for the past 20 years. It has been described but not defined by both the American Association of Colleges of Nursing and the National League for Nursing, although their corresponding accreditation bodies require <b>that</b> critical <b>thinking</b> be included in nursing curricula. In addition, there is no reliable or valid measurement tool for critical thinking ability in nursing. As a result, {{there is a lack}} of research support for the assumptions <b>that</b> critical <b>thinking</b> can be learned and <b>that</b> critical <b>thinking</b> ability improves clinical competence. Brookfield suggested that commitments should be made only after a period of critically reflective analysis, during which the congruence between perceptions and reality are examined. In an evidence-based practice profession, we, as nurse educators, need to ask ourselves how we can defend our assumptions <b>that</b> critical <b>thinking</b> can be learned and <b>that</b> critical <b>thinking</b> improves the quality of nursing practice, especially when there is virtually no consensus on a definition...|$|R

500|$|Near {{the end of}} the {{production}} run of the show's fifth season, Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kenny was killed off permanently. The reasoning behind the idea was to genuinely surprise fans, and to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters Stotch, a breakout character whose popularity was growing with the viewers and creators of the show. In the episode [...] "Kenny Dies", Kenny dies after developing terminal muscular dystrophy, while Parker and Stone claimed that Kenny would not be returning in subsequent episodes. The duo insisted they grew tired of upholding the tradition of having Kenny die in each episode. Stone stated <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> of humorous ways to kill the character was initially fun, but became more mundane as the series progressed. When they determined that it would be too difficult to develop the character because he {{was too much of a}} [...] "prop", Parker and Stone finally decided to kill off Kenny permanently.|$|E
500|$|Typically, when {{creating}} a manga chapter, an artist draws a rough draft or [...] "name", then {{a more detailed}} storyboard, and lastly the finalized version. However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work. He did not plan {{the details of his}} stories in advance. When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters. The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half. Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him. Toriyama said <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks' time travel. The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making it seem to have been foreshadowing. The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, which is exactly what he did.|$|E
500|$|Muransky was {{selected}} in the fourth round (82nd pick) by the Oakland Raiders in the 1982 NFL Draft, and he played in 24 games for the Raiders from 19821984. The Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles to play the 1982 NFL season. Thus, although he was drafted by the Oakland Raiders, he played his NFL career with the Los Angeles Raiders. In his second season in the NFL, he won a Super Bowl ring with the Raiders' 1983 Super Bowl Championship team. He played all 16 regular season games for Tom Flores' Raiders that season. The team went 124 during the 1983 NFL season and produced eight Pro Bowlers. [...] Muransky played for an offensive line that included Pro Bowlers Henry Lawrence and Todd Christensen. The team was led that season by quarterback Jim Plunkett and future Hall of Famer Marcus Allen, who rushed for nine touchdowns, caught two and threw three on a 47 passing performance. Muransky described the Super Bowl experience as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] with [...] "two weeks of hype like you've never seen." [...] He recalled: [...] "It {{was a big deal}} because offensive linemen weren't making what they make today. That year, I made $77,000, which was a pretty decent contract at the time. But if you won the Super Bowl, you won $64,000. So it wasn't peanuts. I remember walking off the field after <b>that,</b> <b>thinking</b> to myself, 'I have a Super Bowl ring {{for the rest of my}} life.'" [...] Although Muransky was cut in for a Super Bowl gameshare, he was not on the official gameday roster.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} role of hopeful {{thinking}} in enhancing life satisfaction among a minority group facing pervasive group-based discrimination: country migrant workers 2 ̆ 7 children in China. Positive psychology reasoning suggests <b>that</b> hopeful <b>thinking</b> can attenuate {{the negative impact of}} perceived discrimination on life satisfaction. This moderation model is compared to a mediation model, which predicts <b>that</b> reduced hopeful <b>thinking</b> explains the negative impact of perceived discrimination on life satisfaction. Study 1 showed <b>that</b> hopeful <b>thinking</b> did not moderate the relationship between discrimination and life satisfaction. Rather, the negative impact of discrimination on life satisfaction was mediated through diminished hopeful thinking. Study 2 manipulated perceived discrimination and replicated Study 1 findings. The results reveal <b>that</b> hopeful <b>thinking</b> can indeed have positive consequences, but <b>that</b> hopeful <b>thinking</b> is also constrained by perceiving discrimination. This suggests that there are limits {{to the extent to which}} hopeful thinking can be developed when facing group-based discrimination...|$|R

2500|$|One {{source of}} the logical {{mistakes}} {{that are at the}} origins of metaphysics is the ambiguity of natural language. [...] "Ordinary language for instance uses the same part of speech, the substantive, for things ('apple') as well as for qualities ('hardness'), relations ('friendship'), and processes ('sleep'); therefore it misleads one into a thing-like conception of functional concepts". Another source of mistakes is [...] "the notion <b>that</b> <b>thinking</b> can either lead to knowledge out of its own resources without using any empirical material, or at least arrive at new contents by an inference from given states of affair". Synthetic knowledge a priori is rejected by the Vienna Circle. Mathematics, which at a first sight seems an example of necessarily valid synthetic knowledge derived from pure reason alone, has instead a tautological character, that is its statements are analytical statements, thus very different from Kantian synthetic statements. The only two kinds of statements accepted by the Vienna Circle are synthetic statements a posteriori (i.e., scientific statements) and analytic statements a priori (i.e., logical and mathematical statements).|$|E
