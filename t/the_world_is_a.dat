5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Save <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E
