None of the kings of the region, {{with the possible exception of}} one Abdi-Ashirta, is called Habiru or SA.GAZ.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} Ming and Qing dynasties, Hong Kong {{was in the}} {{imperial}} district of Xin-An (now Shenzhen) County. The 1819 gazetteer lists 570 Punti and 270 Hakka contemporary settlements in the whole district. However, the area covered by Xin-An county is greater than {{what was to become}} the British imperial enclave of Hong Kong by 1899. Although there had been settlers originating from the mainland proper even before the Tang dynasty, historical records of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> non-extant, only evidence of settlement from archaeological sources can be found. The New Territories lowland areas had been settled originally by several clan lineages in Kam Tin, Sheung Shui, Fanling, Yuen Long, Lin Ma Hang and Tai Po, and hence termed the Punti before the arrival of the Hakka, and fishing families of the Tanka and Hoklo groups to the area. Since the prime farming land had already been farmed, the Hakka land dwellers settled in the less accessible and more hilly areas. Hakka settlements can be found widely distributed around the Punti areas, but in smaller communities. Many are found on coastal areas in inlets and bays surrounded by hills.|$|E
25|$|Just under {{half the}} world's {{population}} {{is currently on}} the Internet. Roughly 75% of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> on social media and Â¾ of those folks have social media accounts on their mobile phones. Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because mobile phones have social networking capabilities, allowing individuals immediate web browsing and access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have grown at a rapid rate, fundamentally altering the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time and allowing companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, or any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, Real-time bidding use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising because of its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising, reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a variety}} of {{findings}} contradict {{the claims of the}} social activity hypothesis. Firstly, it was found that extraverts were happier than introverts even when alone. Specifically, extraverts tend to be happier regardless of whether they live alone or with others, or whether they live in a vibrant city or quiet rural environment. Similarly, a study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992) showed that although extraverts chose social jobs relatively more frequently (51%) than nonsocial jobs compared to introverts (38%), they were happier than introverts regardless of whether their occupations had social or nonsocial character. Secondly, it was found that extraverts only sometimes reported greater amounts of social activity than introverts, but in general extraverts and introverts do not differ in the quantity of their socialization. Similar finding was reported by Srivastava, Angelo, and Vallereux (2008), who found that extraverts and introverts both enjoy participating in social interactions, but extraverts participate socially more. Thirdly, studies have shown that both extraverts and introverts participate in social relations, but that the quality of this participation differs. The more frequent social participation among extraverts could be {{explained by the fact that}} extraverts know more people, but <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily their close friends, whereas introverts, when participating in social interactions, are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships.|$|E

500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. I feel like we pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, and from what I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E

Rather than be vague and poetic, let's just call this what it is. That way I may get people's attention. That's the idea." [...] Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression-era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them. When writing the album, he also touched on the Occupy movement, which he felt optimistic about, saying that [...] "There's a sign of something. <b>Those</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> having conversations, and the conversations become issues and the issues become talked about.

I wasn't even aware that two thirds of the world population are extremely poor, living on less than a dollar a day, and that 70 percent of <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> women and children.
