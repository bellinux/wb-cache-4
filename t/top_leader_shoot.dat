40|$|Purpose - To {{explain the}} {{importance}} of <b>top</b> <b>leaders</b> on international diversification among SMEs. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical data was collected among 98 micro, small and medium-sized furniture producers in Sweden using a survey questionnaire. The impact of <b>top</b> <b>leader</b> characteristics on international diversification was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. Findings – The result {{is in line with}} the strategic choice perspective, and upper echelon theory, in that individuals impact the organizational behavior through strategic decisions. More precisely, the <b>top</b> <b>leader’s</b> attitude was found to have a strong direct impact on the firm’s international behavior, i. e. international diversification. Also, the top leaders’ foreign experience from living and working abroad had an impact on international diversification. Finally, market knowledge measured in terms of current customer certainty impacted international diversification positively. Of the control variables, only firm size appeared to be of any importance, with an increase in size having a positive impact on international diversification. Research limitations/implications - The empirical data used originate from within a highly homogeneous group of companies, restricting generalization of the results. In addition, the number of respondents was low. The key informant approach was used, and thus collecting empirical data from other individuals constituting the corporate elite of the firm could be valuable. Originality – In many studies striving to explain firm behavior the value of including cognitive measures is emphasized. Still demographic data frequently substitute for lack of cognitive data. Here, both demographic and cognitive measures at <b>top</b> <b>leader</b> level are included. In addition, while the association between the <b>top</b> <b>leader</b> of SMEs and the firms’ international behavior has been well researched, the impact of the <b>top</b> <b>leader</b> on the firm’s international conduct has been described as relatively unexplored. Here, such impact is in focus...|$|R

40|$|Workplace {{bullying}} is {{a global}} problem that leaves workers emotionally harmed and organizations financially strapped; yet in many cases, business leaders fail to adequately address the problem. The purpose {{of this research was}} to determine if the <b>top</b> <b>leader</b> had a direct impact on the presence of bullying within the workplace. Based on personality trait theory as a theoretical foundation, the key issue this study explored was the relationship between the presence of workplace bullying and observed narcissistic behaviors exhibited by the <b>top</b> <b>leader.</b> Participants consisted of 84 human resources professionals reporting directly to the CEO/president of companies located in the United States. Observer-rated assessments were used to measure the leader 2 ̆ 7 s observed narcissistic behaviors along with the prevalence of bullying within the workplace. Logistic regression and Pearson correlation were used to analyze assessment data. Results revealed a strong and positive relationship between <b>top</b> <b>leaders</b> 2 ̆ 7 observed narcissistic behaviors and the presence of bullying within the organization. These results suggest the <b>top</b> <b>leader</b> may not only directly impact the presence of workplace bullying, but may actually create the problem. This study contributes to social change by providing support for the need to use personality assessments when hiring or promoting <b>top</b> <b>leaders.</b> By identifying those who contribute to the sustainability of bullying, these individuals can be excluded from the selection process and workplace bullying will therefore be minimized, improving the well-being of employees and the financial performance of organizations, world-wide...|$|R
