Evans wrote in his diary that he was due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then {{why did you want to}} do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E

Whitehead, it turns out, is more interested in cricket. [...] Whitehead takes Reggie along to the match, in time to see Sam get out for a duck.|$|E

I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed, Vaughan was longing {{to work on}} {{material}} for his next LP, but in January 1987, he filed for a divorce from Lenny, which restricted him of any projects until the proceedings were finalized. This prevented him from writing and recording songs for almost two years, but Double Trouble wrote the song [...] "Crossfire" [...] with Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth. Layton recalled: [...] "Basically, we wrote the music, {{and they had to}} write the lyrics. We had just gotten together; Stevie was unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> that time. He was in Dallas doing some things, and we just got together and started writing some songs. That was the first one we wrote." [...] On August 6, 1987, Double Trouble appeared at the Austin Aqua Festival, where they played to one of the largest audiences of their career. According to biographer Craig Hopkins, as many as 20,000 people attended the concert. Following a month-long tour as the opening act for Robert Plant in May 1988, which included a concert at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the band was booked for a European leg, which included 22 performances, and ended in Oulu, Finland on July 17. This would be Vaughan's last concert appearance in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Although some biographers still {{accept the}} story told at the inquest as a true account, the {{majority}} nowadays {{find it hard to}} believe, and suggest that it was a deliberate murder, even though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little agreement as <b>to</b> just who <b>was</b> behind it or their motive for such a course of action.

40|$|Caribbean {{communities}} in Britain {{are known for}} the high religiosity of their people, and yet as ‘popular’ as the Church appears <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the same time an over-representation of many in the criminal justice, mental health and social care systems. This thesis takes {{a new approach to}} examining the effectiveness of the Church in their lives; rather than examine its belief systems and rituals, it looks at the worship and personal experience of Baptists, the oldest inherited Christian denomination, through the lens of culture. It reveals through practices and experiences, that British Caribbean Christians continue to maintain an allegiance to inherited missionary prejudices against Caribbean culture, enforced by leaders, through a system of social stratification, resulting in self-loathing, alienation and dislocation. They are a people who respect biblical stories and particularly the story of the Exodus, which gives meaning to not just their religious, but social and political lives. This thesis theologically reflects on that story, reframing it to demonstrate that Moses <b>is</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> celebrated, but not simply as one who leads God’s people out of Egypt, but to the Promised Land; being a successful prototype of a leadership founded on cultural inclusion.
