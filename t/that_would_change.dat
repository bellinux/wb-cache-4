5|$|Jolliffe's motives {{regarding}} his accusations, {{as well as}} his choice of words, would be questioned for many years afterwards. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>change.</b> In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his Memoirs he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Due to Lewis's discovery, Drew's son Edward, placed extremely restrictive conditions on his father's papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada that continue as of 2010.|$|E

5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

25|$|For {{several years}} the new field was used mainly for {{training}} and aerobatic flights. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> in 1920 when the United States Postal Service (USPS) began air mail service to Salt Lake City. The airport expanded and hangars and other buildings began to appear. In the same year, the airfield was given the name Woodward Field, named for John P. Woodward, a local aviator.|$|E
25|$|Minkus's {{life from}} 1842 to 1852 is poorly documented—travel {{applications}} survive which show requests to visit Germany, France and England. In 1852 Minkus accepted {{the position of}} principal violinist to the Vienna Court Opera, but because this meant that he also had to fulfill the usual duties this position demanded, he resigned that same year to take up an important musical assignment abroad <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> his life forever.|$|E
25|$|The President of the Czech Republic has the {{authority}} to act independently in a number of substantive areas. One of the office's strongest powers is that of veto, which returns a bill to parliament. Although the veto may be overridden by parliament, the ability to refuse to sign legislation acts as a check on the power of the legislature. The only kind of bills a President can neither veto nor approve are acts <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the constitution.|$|E

25|$|Though not {{the oldest}} member, Adama {{was one of}} the more zealous about Usman's ideas. Usman thus {{presented}} him with a command <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> his life dramatically. The Shehu gave Adama his blessing and presented him with a flag, the symbol of command in Usman's army. The Shehu then charged Adama to carry the jihad into Fumbina and from the Nile to the Bight of Biafra. Adama also received the power to distribute flags of command to others, thus establishing more centres of Fulani Islam and spreading the war to farther reaches.|$|E
25|$|Art Woodley {{had been}} advised {{that he would}} have to change the Woodley Airways name to {{something}} other than his own name in order to be considered a serious contender for new routes by the CAB regulators. Woodley sent his attorney to Juneau to file papers <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the name to Alaska Airlines. The attorney filed the documents, but neglected to pay the $15 filing fee. Alaska Star Airlines quickly filed the legal documents to rename their company, becoming Alaska Airlines on September 16, 1943, and the company was incorporated under its new name on May 2, 1944.|$|E
25|$|Cymric was {{witness to}} a sad event <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the way lighthouses and lightships are {{administered}} in Ireland. At the time, they were directly controlled from the UK by Trinity House, who removed a lightship from the Arklow Bank. On 19 February 1931, the Julia en route from Glasgow to Newhaven, grounded on the Arklow Bank and was wrecked {{with the loss of}} the crew of five, two of whom were from Arklow. Cymric, with her shallow draught, discovered the tragedy two days later. It became a political issue. In 1935, the 'Irish Lights Commissioners (Adaptation) Order' was made. It is the legislative basis for the Commissioners of Irish Lights.|$|E

25|$|All <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> {{during the}} term of Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas. Basco had plans to develop and promote Philippine agriculture, and de Vianna's {{proposal}} seemed attractive to him. After studying the proposal, Basco sent his plan to establish a large-scale tobacco production in the colony under complete ownership and management by the colonial government of Spain. What probably perked up the ears of the Spanish king about Basco's plan to make the Philippine colony financially self-sufficient, thus removing a huge financial burden from the Spanish crown. The King of Spain issued a royal decree on February 9, 1780 setting in motion Basco's plan.|$|E

After the show the ring announcers Miguel Linares, Leonardo Magadan and Jesus Zuniga taped various introduction segments to be used when the Anniversary show would be broadcast on television at a later date. Fans were still entering the building during the first match as there were large areas of empty seats during this match, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> over time as Arena México looking to be at more or less full capacity by the time the third match started.|$|E
25|$|The USA {{team had}} played 16 {{quarters}} {{leading to the}} gold medal game, and had not been out scored in any of them. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> in the championship game. The team from Brazil scored the first six points, and held a 186–7 lead {{at the end of}} the first quarter. Brazil would score the opening two-point of the second period, but the USA team regained its bearings and took over the game. The USA team outscored Brazil 22–8 in the second period and 21–7 in the third to take a commanding lead. Four USA players scored in double digits, led by Morgan Tuck with 15. The final score of the championship was 71–47.|$|E

25|$|After Dawkins and Willoughby, no {{high school}} player went {{directly}} to the NBA for 20 years, although Lloyd Daniels and Shawn Kemp went to the NBA without having played college basketball (both had enrolled in college, but never played). <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> in 1995 with the arrival of future NBA MVP Kevin Garnett, who was selected fifth overall. The following year, another future MVP in Kobe Bryant and a future All-Star in Jermaine O'Neal were first-round picks out of high school. Most years after that saw at least one, and often more, high-schoolers drafted, most notably Tracy McGrady (1997), Kwame Brown (the first high-schooler to be the #1 overall pick, in 2001), Amar'e Stoudemire (2002), LeBron James (#1 in 2003), and Dwight Howard (#1 in 2004).|$|E
25|$|All of <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> {{with the}} {{government}} determination to acquire the barrier islands for public park land. The state of North Carolina began purchasing land on the Core Banks and Shackleford Banks in 1959 {{with the intention of}} creating a state park. The federal government became interested a few years later, and envisioned the Outer Banks of North Carolina being included in a string of national seashores stretching the length of the United States Atlantic coast. After negotiations between the state of North Carolina and the United States Department of the Interior, the United States Congress passed a law authorizing the creation of a Cape Lookout National Seashore, which was signed into law by President Lyndon Baines Johnson on March 10, 1966.|$|E
25|$|It {{was here}} that Carl started {{composing}} his first songs {{with an eye toward}} the future. Watching the dance floor at all times for a reaction, working out a more rhythmically driving style of music that was neither country nor blues, but had elements of both, Perkins kept reshaping these loosely structured songs until he had a completed composition, which would then be finally put to paper. Carl was already sending demos to New York record companies, who kept rejecting him, sometimes explaining that this strange new style of country with a pronounced rhythm fit no current commercial trend. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>change</b> in 1955 after recording the song 'Blue Suede Shoes' (recorded 19 December 1955). Later made more famous by Elvis Presley, Perkins' original version was an early rock 'n' roll standard.|$|E
