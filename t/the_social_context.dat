5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on their own (or blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>context</b> in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E
5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>context</b> in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E

While Jesus' miracles fit within <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>context</b> of antiquity, he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed.

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>context</b> may also be important.|$|E

40|$|Background Social {{media is}} {{constantly}} growing {{and has also}} started to be a platform for dissatisfied customers to express their complaints. This give companies an opportunity {{to respond to the}} complaints by solving the problems and prevent customers from switching to competitors or spread negative word of mouth. Therefore, it is important to handle complaints in a proper way. There are six response dimensions that are of importance when handling complaints and that impacts customer satisfaction. These dimensions will be used in this research and are named timeliness, redress, apology, credibility, attentiveness and facilitation. Purpose To explain how companies’ complaint handling positively impact customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context.</b> Method This research utilizes a quantitative approach and consist of six hypotheses: H 1 Timeliness has a positive impact on customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context.</b> H 2 Redress has a positive impact on customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context.</b> H 3 Apology has a positive impact on customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context.</b> H 4 Credibility has a positive impact on customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context.</b> H 5 Attentiveness has a positive impact on customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context.</b> H 6 Facilitation has a positive impact on customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context.</b> <b>The</b> sample is users of social media that are 18 years old or older. The sampling was done by using convenience sampling and the snowball effect. The data were collected using an online questionnaire which was sent out via Facebook. Conclusion It can be concluded that complaint handling positively impact customer satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> media <b>context</b> by <b>the</b> use of facilitation. Timeliness, redress, apology, credibility and attentiveness have no significant positive impact on customer satisfaction. Since facilitation is about procedures and events that happens before the actual response to the complaint, it could be concluded that complaint handling is something that companies needs to work with proactive in order to affect customer satisfaction positiv...|$|R

The employee compares his inputs relative to outcomes; and, then, extrapolating to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>context,</b> the employee compares his input/outcome ratio with the perceived ratios of others. If the employee perceives an inequity, the theory posits that the employee will adjust his behavior to bring things into balance.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines <b>the</b> role of <b>social</b> <b>context</b> in ethical consumption, specifically, {{the extent}} to which anonymity and social control influence individuals' decisions to purchase organic and Fair Trade coffee. Our research design overcomes biases of prior research by combining framing and discrete choice experiments in a survey. We systematically vary coffee growing method (organic or not), import status (Fair Trade or not), flavor, and price across four <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> that vary in degree of anonymity and normative <b>social</b> control. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> are buying coffee online, in a large grocery store, in a small neighborhood shop, and for a meeting of a human rights group. Subjects comprise 1, 103 German and American undergraduate students. We find that <b>social</b> <b>context</b> indeed influences subjects' ethical consumer decisions, especially in situations with low anonymity and high social control. In addition, gender, coffee buying, and subjective social norms trigger heterogeneity regarding stated ethical consumption and <b>the</b> effects of <b>social</b> <b>context.</b> These results suggest previous research has underestimated <b>the</b> relevance of <b>social</b> <b>context</b> for ethical consumption and overestimated altruistic motives of ethical consumers.

25|$|Levels of FOXP2 {{in adult}} zebra finches are {{significantly}} higher when males direct their song to females {{than when they}} sing song in other contexts. “Directed” singing refers to when a male is singing to a female usually for a courtship display. “Undirected” singing occurs when for example, a male sings when other males are present or is alone. Studies have found that FoxP2 levels vary depending on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>context.</b> When the birds were singing undirected song, there was a decrease in of FoxP2 expression in Area X. This downregulation was not observed and FoxP2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the drum dance and game songs, Greenlandic Inuit have a tradition of piseq (piserk, personal song) songs. These are expressive, spiritual, superstitious or narrative and may be composed for drum dances. Piseq and other vocal traditions aside from song games include a number of styles and tones, which vary depending on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>context</b> of the performance. For example, a soft vocal tone is used both for character illustration in a narrative song and for personal songs in private settings. Many songs use only a few real words, interspersed among numerous vocables, or non-lexical syllables like ai-ya-yainga. Inuit songs are strophic and mostly use six different pitches; textual and melodic motifs are common. A song's word length and accentuation determines the rhyhm, giving the songs a recitative-like style.|$|E
