The dimension of cross section of the specimen was varied in order to investigate the influence of the shape of cross section on shearing strength.

Accordingly, in order to measure shearing strength of L-R plane, a specimen was used, having a large ratio between width and height. 4) Shearing strength of the <b>torsion</b> <b>test</b> was about twice as large as that of JIS shear test.

Uniaxial tension tests of the specimens with various off-axis angles were conducted, and the shear stress at failure was obtained. Independent of the tension <b>tests,</b> <b>torsion</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted, and the shear strengths were obtained. Comparing the data of the uniaxial tension and <b>torsion</b> <b>tests,</b> we examined the validity of estimating shear strength by the off-axis tension test. The shear strengths obtained from the tension tests coincided well with those measured by the <b>torsion</b> <b>tests</b> when the specimen had an off-axis angle of 15 °– 30 °. In this off-axis angle range, the tensile stress perpendicular to the grain might have a serious influence on the shear strength, and we thought that the shear strength predicted by uniaxial tension tests should be treated as an approximate value despite the simplicity of the tension test. Other test methods should be adopted to obtain the precise shear strength of wood.|$|R

The crystallographic texture and its evolutions – quite significant in the ductile 36 NiCrMo 16 steel – play a significant role. No void nucleation was observed in steel. Microcracks initiated at an early stage but did not grow up to a large shear strain. Due to some reorientations, clusters of grains sharing the same orientation appeared.

40|$|The {{method of}} Fields and Backofen has been {{commonly}} used to reduce {{the data obtained by}} hot <b>torsion</b> <b>test</b> into flow curves. The method, however, is most suitable for materials with monotonic strain hardening behaviour. Other methods such as Stüwe’s method, tubular specimens, differential testing and the inverse method, each suffer from similar drawbacks. It is shown in the current work that for materials with multiple regimes of hardening any method based on an assumption of constant hardening indices introduces some errors into the flow curve obtained from the hot <b>torsion</b> <b>test.</b> Therefore such methods do not enable accurate prediction of onset of recrystallisation where slow softening occurs. A new method to convert results from the hot <b>torsion</b> <b>test</b> into flow curves by taking into account the variation of constitutive parameters during deformation is presented. The method represents the torque twist data by a parametric linear least square model in which Euler and hyperbolic coefficients are used as the parameters. A closed form relationship obtained from the mathematical representation of the data is employed next for flow stress determination. Two different solution strategies, the method of normal equations and singular value decomposition, were used for parametric modelling of the data with hyperbolic basis functions. The performance of both methods is compared.

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} {{index is}} one of the important parameters to express subcritical crack growth within the rock. The mechanism of stress corrosion is influenced by the chemical effect of water in the rock and the surrounding environment. There are some laboratory tests to estimate stress corrosion index such as the double <b>torsion</b> <b>test,</b> the uniaxial compression test under various strain/stress loading rates, the uniaxial compression test and disc test under various water vapor pressures. However, since the conditions such as geometry and state of stress of the specimen and the surrounding environment are different in each test, {{it is likely that the}} stress corrosion indexes from these tests could be different. In this paper, we compared stress corrosion indexes of Kumamoto andesite obtained by three types of laboratory test. The tests included the uniaxial compression test and the disc test under various water vapor pressures, and double <b>torsion</b> <b>test</b> under a constant surrounding environment. The stress corrosion indexes were estimated to be 44 in the uniaxial compression test, 43 in the disc test and 37 in the double <b>torsion</b> <b>test.</b> These values were considered to be similar, though the value in the double <b>torsion</b> <b>test</b> was slightly smaller than the others. Furthermore, both stress corrosion indexes of another Kumamoto andesite obtained by the uniaxial compression tests under various water vapor pressures and various strain loading rates were the same values. Therefore, it is considered that a stress corrosion index is not affected by the experimental method and experimental environment very much and could be one of the material constants of the rock...|$|E

Plastic theories of continuum mechanics {{are used for}} analyzing deformation behavior of the material after yielding. Here, material is presumed to have isotropic hardening characteristic.

40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour of a {{duplex stainless}} steel {{has been investigated}} by tensile and <b>torsion</b> <b>tests</b> at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1275 °C. The microstructure of the as received material consists of elongated islands of austenitic grains in {{a more or less}} continuous ferrite matrix.
