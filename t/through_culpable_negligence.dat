On 28 November 2012 the train driver, 41-year-old Titus S., was {{convicted and sentenced to}} one year on probation following the proposal of both state attorney and defense. The defense stated however that Deutsche Bahn should bear the main share of the blame for ignoring safety problems on the track that had been known before (a near collision of two passenger trains had occurred a few kilometers away in 2006 leading to a plan for an immediate installation of safety measures, which however was delayed until after the Hordorf collision). Two joint plaintiffs criticized the result, filing an appeal, which was rejected by the BGH supreme court on 6 August 2013.|$|E

40|$|Thermonuclear (H-bomb) test by the United States {{which was}} carried out at the Bikini proving ground in the Western Pacific's Marshall Islands on March 1 st, 1954, {{occurred}} the regrettable incident of the Fukuryu Maru No. 5. An amicable settlement of this affair has been negotiating between the United States and Japan, {{but there have been}} some differences of opinion with regard to the compensation for the suffering and losses of the fishermen. Hoping a full settlement of this affair, we deal here some problem on international law. It seems to be an empty pleonasm to assert that this treatise on international law deals with these problems only from a juristic point of view. So far as international law concerned, there are two problems at issue. One is whether the danger zone designated by the U. S. Navy bulletin would be compatible, or not, with the principle of the freedom of open seas. Resarch of this principle leads to a conclusion that the danger zone is delict on the international law in so far as it seeks to use a vast expanse of the open seas {{for a long time in}} such a manner that the ships of other nations will find it dangerous to sail there. On the other hand, there is a prevailing opinion that the responsibility of state should be beared upon the fault, and that if a malice or <b>culpable</b> <b>negligence</b> on the part of the United States is not certain, Japan would not claim compensation for the damage. The verification of such a theory, hawever, lends to the conclusion that in so far as the acts of state organs a state has the duty of redress to the damage notwithstanding a malice or <b>culpable</b> <b>negligence,</b> so that, the United States would not be exempted from the duty of redress for the Fukuryu Maru No. 5. Thus, the present writer concludes that it is not a incidental violation of international law but a symptom of a world-wide decline of faith in the basic norm of international law...|$|R

50|$|At the {{subsequent}} inquest, the two brakesmen {{of the goods}} train did not give evidence (on legal advice), and the coroner's jury returned a verdict of manslaughter against them. The jury also strongly censured the station-master at Llanddulas for allowing shunting when the express was expected imminently, contrary to the LNWR’s rules. The brakesmen were tried for manslaughter at Ruthin assizes the following spring, but acquitted. From contemporary press accounts, at the assizes the judge's charge {{to the grand jury}} gave a strong indication that the brakesmen were - or should have been - under the control of a superior officer: the Llanddulas stationmaster. He then instructed the jury that they should consider if the brakesmen were {{under the control of the}} stationmaster, and if there was <b>culpable</b> <b>negligence,</b> whose was the negligence? Despite this the jury returned a true bill, and the brakesmen were tried the next day, the trial jury retiring for less than 10 minutes before returning a verdict of 'Not Guilty'.|$|R

50|$|The legal {{position}} was complicated because although the accident occurred in Scotland, {{some of the}} injured subsequently died in England where the law was different. In Scotland, deaths were investigated by the procurator fiscal who, if he found culpability {{on the part of}} anyone, could order their arrest and charge them with culpable homicide. In England the coroner investigated death and, if the coroner's jury found that death was due to neglect, then the coroner could indict charges of manslaughter against the named parties. The coroner for Carlisle, Mr T S Strong, asked for guidance from the Home Office and was instructed to conduct inquests on those who had died in England in the normal way. The inquest opened on 25 May but was immediately adjourned until 23 June to allow Lt-Col. Druitt to finish his investigation. After two days hearing evidence from, among others, Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson, Strong summed up the evidence to the nineteen-man jury. He highlighted that if Meakin and Tinsley had obeyed the rules on any of (a) blocking back, (b) lever collars or (c) a correctly kept train register, they could not have forgotten the stationary train. He concluded his summing up with:If you find as a result of your deliberations that the rules and safeguards were broken by {{one or more of the}} railwaymen concerned, or in other words that they have been negligent, there remains one point which you must decide, and it is this.Was that negligence of such a character—having regard to all the surroundings—as to be <b>culpable</b> <b>negligence,</b> or in other words gross negligence?If so it was manslaughter.|$|R

In October 1841 a strong difference of opinion arose with governor Franklin over the reinstatement by Franklin of a surgeon who had been dismissed after being charged with <b>culpable</b> <b>negligence.</b> Franklin reinstated him because he thought that further evidence showed the penalty to have been unjust, Montagu declared that the reinstatement would degrade the colonial secretary's office, and that if Franklin persisted in his determination he must not expect the same assistance from the colonial secretary that had been hitherto given. Franklin would not be intimidated and friction continued for some time. On 17 January 1842 in writing to Franklin, Montagu said, [...] "while your excellency and all the members of your government have had such frequent opportunities of testing my memory as to have acquired for it the reputation of a remarkably accurate one, your officers have not been without opportunity of learning that your excellency could not always place implicit reliance upon your own." [...] In the circumstances this could only be taken as insulting, and Franklin feeling there was no possibility of their working together, dismissed Montagu from his office. Montagu withdrew the offending phrase but Franklin's mind was made up. Montagu, however, went to England and so successfully brought his case before Lord Stanley, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, that Governor Franklin was recalled.|$|R
