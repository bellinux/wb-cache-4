40|$|The {{azimuthal}} {{order of}} a hexatic liquid crystal bounded by two parallel borders in a field applied perpendicularly to the two interfaces is theoretically discussed and an anchoring-dependent phase separation is predicted. It is found that periodical or exponential-type phase separation along {{the direction of the}} applied field occurs at a series of favourable lengths associated with anchoring strength, susceptibility anisotropy, nematic as well as hexatic orders. Deviation from the favorable length may invoke a pair of sheet disclinations at the boundaries, which will shift {{to the middle of the}} cell in order <b>to</b> <b>substain</b> the harmony between dimension and anchoring.

To address the contribution of CD 4 � CD 25 � T regulatory (Treg) cells to IL- 10 -mediated susceptibility, we depleted CD 4 � CD 25 � cells in vivo and reconstituted IL- 4 R � � RAG 2 recipients with purified CD 4 � CD 25 � T cells. Although anti-CD 25 mAb treatment significantly decreased parasite numbers in IL- 4 R � �/ � mice, treatment with anti-IL- 10 R mAb virtually eliminated L. major parasites in both footpad and dermal infection sites. In addition, IL- 4 R � � RAG 2 mice reconstituted with CD 4 � cells depleted of CD 25 � Treg cells remained highly susceptible to infection. Analysis of L. major-infected BALB/c and IL- 4 R � �/ � inflammatory sites revealed that the majority of IL- 10 was secreted by the CD 4 � Foxp 3 � population, with a fraction of IL- 10 coming from CD 4 � Foxp 3 � Treg cells. All T cell IFN-� production was also derived from the CD 4 � Foxp 3 � population. Nevertheless, the IL- 4 R � �/ �-infected ear dermis, but not draining lymph nodes, consistently displayed 1. 5 - to 2 -fold greater percentages of CD 4 � CD 25 � and CD 4 � Foxp 3 � Treg cells compared with the BALB/c-infected dermis. Thus, CD 4 � Foxp 3 � T cells are a major source of IL- 10 that disrupts IFN- � activity in L. majorsusceptible BALB/c mice. However, the increase in CD 4 � Foxp 3 � T cells within the IL- 4 R � �/ � dermis implies a possible IL- 10 independent role for Treg cells within the infection site, and may indicate a novel immune escape mechanism used by L. major parasites in {{the absence of}} IL- 4 /IL- 13 signaling.

40|$|International audienceThe diet {{of young}} {{of the year}} sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax L., from sheep grazed and ungrazed tidal salt marshes were com-pared qualitatively and quantitatively in Mont Saint-Michel Bay. In areas without grazing pressure, the {{vegetation}} gradient changes from a pioneer Puccinellia maritima dominated community at the tidal Â¯at boundaries through a Atriplex portulacoides dominated community {{in the middle of}} the marsh to a mature Elymus pungens dominated community at the landward edge. The A. portula-coides community is highly productive and provides important quantities of litter which provides a habitat and good supply <b>to</b> <b>substain</b> high densities of the detrivorous amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. In the grazed areas, the vegetation is replaced by P. maritima communities, a low productive grass plant, and food availability and habitat suitability are reduced for O. gammarellus. Juvenile sea bass colonise the salt marsh at Â¯ood during 43 % of the spring tides which inundate the salt marsh creeks. They forage inside the marsh and feed mainly on O. gammarellus in the ungrazed marshes. In grazed areas, this amphipod is replaced by other species and juvenile sea bass consume less food from the marsh. This illustrates a direct effect of a terrestrial herbivore on a coastal food web, and suggests that management of salt marsh is complex and promotion of one component of their biota could involve reductions in other species...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we treat about early mother-infant interactions. Communication is {{considered}} like a co-regulated, continuous process, in which both mother and infant are dynamically involved to build interactive and syntonic behavioural patterns. We videotaped 15 mother-child dyades during a 3 –minutes free play situation at 2, 5 months and at 7 months; then we coded these interactions frame-by-frame using a PC program (Theme 97), in order {{to look for a}} kind of interactive behavioural temporal patterns. Our data were organized to observe: 1) child’s interactive skills at two different ages, in particular child’s abilities to start a communicative sequence; 2) mother’s role in co-regulated processes; 3) the main complex patterns, to research child’s agency-intentionality early forms. Our results confirm that child has an active role in building communicative processes yet at 2, 5 months (children begin 42 % of interactions at this age, 46, 9 % at 7 months). Mothers change their behavioural patterns at different ages: maternal behaviours decrease in order <b>to</b> <b>substain</b> children’s evolution. We found complex and recurrent interactional patterns both at 2, 5 and at 7 months. Mother and child use specific behavioural patterns for each age; comparing these patterns, we found that they are different in length but not in complexity. On these basis we can support that communication is a complex process from its beginning...|$|E

40|$|Federalism in Italy arised {{beginning}} ’ 90, pushed bipartisanly from {{establishment in}} order to contrast the succesfull poll of northern league party. Being about 80 % of the regions budget for healthcare, federalism had its hard impact on it. Regions can manage autonomously their healthcare organization, adding to the State financial resources own money earning from other their services or coming from local taxes, on condition that they provide the State LEA (Essential Level of Assistance). That means {{a high level of}} responsabilization for local government for reaching a higher level of efficiency in allocation of resources and organizational models of production and erogation of healthcare, beside a better ability to catch local healthcare demand. Even if now the sharing of State financial resources are agreed between all regions and Government, it’s not clear for the future wheter each region will have to procure its own finance, introducing many problems for those southern regions unable <b>to</b> <b>substain</b> theirselves. It has still to be defined wheter and how reach regions will have to transfer part of their resources to the poor ones. That means a risk of iniquity of level in healthcare provision among regions of the same country, generating possible social conflict. Therefore federalism now has from a hand the opportunity to better tail healthcare on each local demand and, on the other hand, it risks to introduce social disparity and conflicts...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{zones are}} {{strategically}} important zones, where live {{a lot of}} European citizens: they are important to produce food and row materials, they are essential for traffic and commerce relations, they hold {{some of the most}} precious habitats, and besides they are choosen to spend at the best one's free time. Nevertheless the attraction of coastal zones is ever more in danger: their natural sources are extremely overworked, the lack of space causes fights in its employment, large season fluctuation of people and work. Natural ecosystems, of which depend coastal zones, are in decline. Politics and laws regarding the administration of coastal zones as well as their realisation have developped separetly and only by sector. The global administration of coastal zones is therefore to be realized strategically both for their programming and administrating. It has also to ensure a better base to exploit of synergy, reduction of inconsistency and best realization of a lasting development. Owing to the request of maritime space for different aims, as the production of energy through renewable sources, research and exploitation of naphte and gas, sea traffic and fishing activities, salvage of ecosystems and bio diversities, obtaining of rough materials, tourism, aims regarding water culture and underwater cultural heritage, it is necessary to project sea activities by considering a global ecosystem. Such an administrative act as regards sea problems is the maritime spatial planning, which purpose is <b>to</b> <b>substain</b> a lasting sea and ocean development as well as an infra or better a supersector political object able to permit to public organs and participants the employment of the global and international use. The programming result is the concrete marine spatial plan. Owing to the international nature of sea and coastal processes it is to consider the cooperation with the neghbouring countries within regional seas. In the global administration of coastal zones and in the marine spatial planning must be highly considered both the terrestrialand the sea space...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{reform in}} European {{antitrust}} enforcement is embodied in Regolation n. 1 / 2003 / Ce and related Communications. Since 2004 {{when it came}} into force, some crytical assessments can already be made. The work starts from some technical analysis of the reform, under a procedural perspective, to assess the proceedings’ real impact on parties’ rights and to criticize its limits. Decentralisation has brought about more complicacies, since community procedural systems are not harmonized, neither in their administrative rules, nor in their civil proceedings, which are all involved in the European antitrust network. Therefore, antitrust proceedings end un as being more jurisdictional in their effects than in their guarentees, which is a flaw to be mended by legislators. National laws shoud be harmonized, community law should be clarified and the system should turn more honestly towards a rationalized jurisdiction-cented mechanism. Otherwise, parties defense rights and the overall efficiency are put into doubt. Italy is a good exemple of how many colmlicacies can outburst from national procedures and national decentralised application. An uncertain pattern of judicial control, together with unclear relationships among the institutions to cooperate in the antitrust network can produce more problems than they aim to solve. As to the private enforcement, Regulation n. 1 does not even attempt to give precise regulation to this underdeveloped sector. A continual comparison with U. S. system has brought the Commission to become aware both of the risks and of the advanteges of an increased civil antitrust litigation in fronto of national judges. In order <b>to</b> <b>substain</b> a larger development of this parallel and, presently, difficult way of judicial compensation, it is presently ongoing a consultation among states to find suitable incentives to make private enforcement more appealing and effective. The solution to this lack of private litigation {{is not to be}} sought in Regulation n. 1 which calls into action national legislators and proceedures to implement further improvements. As a conclusion, Regulation n. 1 is the outpost of an ambitious community design to create an efficient control mechanism over antitrust violations. It focuses on Commission proceedings, powers and sanctions in order to establish deterrence, then it highlights civil litigation perspectives and it involves directly states into antitrust application. It seems that more could be done to technically shape administrative proceedings in a more jurisdictionally oriented form, then to clarify respective roles and coordination mecanisms in order to prevent difficulties easy to forsee. Some of jurisprudential suggestions have been accepted, but much more is left {{to be done in the}} future to improve european antitrust enforcement system...|$|E
