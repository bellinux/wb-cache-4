25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system <b>to</b> <b>decohere.</b> However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.|$|E
50|$|A topological quantum {{computer}} is a theoretical {{quantum computer}} that employs two-dimensional quasiparticles called anyons, whose world lines pass around {{one another to}} form braids in a three-dimensional spacetime (i.e., one temporal plus two spatial dimensions). These braids form the logic gates {{that make up the}} computer. The advantage of a quantum computer based on quantum braids over using trapped quantum particles is that the former is much more stable. Small, cumulative perturbations can cause quantum states <b>to</b> <b>decohere</b> and introduce errors in the computation, but such small perturbations do not change the braids' topological properties. This is like the effort required to cut a string and reattach the ends to form a different braid, as opposed to a ball (representing an ordinary quantum particle in four-dimensional spacetime) bumping into a wall. Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computation in 1997. While the elements of a topological quantum computer originate in a purely mathematical realm, experiments in fractional quantum Hall systems indicate these elements may be created in the real world using semiconductors made of gallium arsenide at a temperature of near absolute zero and subjected to strong magnetic fields.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{being one}} of the {{hallmarks}} of quantum physics, {{there is a lack of}} operational interpretations of quantum coherence. Here we provide an operational interpretation of coherence of a quantum system, in terms of the amount of noise that is to be injected in order <b>to</b> fully <b>decohere</b> it. In particular, we show that in the asymptotic limit, the minimum amount of noise that is required <b>to</b> fully <b>decohere</b> a quantum system, is equal to the relative entropy of coherence. This quantifies the erasure cost of quantum coherence. We employ the entropy exchanged between system and environment during the decohering operation and the memory required to store the information about the decohering operation as the quantifiers of noise. We show that both the quantifiers yield the same cost of erasing coherence in the asymptotic limit. The relative entropy of coherence, hence, is endowed with a thermodynamical and operational interpretation.

40|$|Entangled qubit pairs {{can serve}} as a quantum memory or as a {{resource}} for quantum communication. The utility of such pairs is measured by how long they take <b>to</b> disentangle or <b>decohere.</b> <b>To</b> answer the question of whether qubit-qubit interactions can prolong entanglement, we calculate the dissipative dynamics of a pair of qubits coupled via the exchange interaction in the presence of random telegraph noise and 1 /f noise. We show that for maximally entangled (Bell) states, the exchange interaction generally suppresses decoherence and disentanglement. This suppression is more apparent for random telegraph noise if the noise is non-Markovian, whereas for 1 /f noise the exchange interaction should be comparable in magnitude to strongest noise source. The entangled singlet-triplet superposition state of 2 qubits (ψ_± Bell state) can be protected by the interaction, while for the triplet-triplet state (ϕ_± Bell state), it is less effective.

In the case of flux noise, we resolve spectral features due to coherent fluctuators, and further identify a signature of the 1 MHz defect in a time-domain spin-echo experiment.

In the regime of the weak-strong beam-beam interaction, if two beams have the same machine tunes, on-axis head-on collisions between a mismatched strong beam and a weak beam will not cause the formation of halo. However, if the two beams collide with an initial offset, the beam-beam force from the mismatched strong beam can cause halo formation and emittance growth in the weak beam. Meanwhile, if two beams have different machine tunes, for opposite charged colliding beams, when the machine tune of the weak beam is smaller than that of the strong beam, there is emittance growth in the weak beam. When the machine tune of the weak beam is larger than that of the strong beam, there is little emittance growth. In the regime of the strong-strong beam-beam interaction, halo is formed in both beams even when the two beams collide head-on on the axis with equal machine tunes.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{decoherence}} formalism {{of quantum mechanics}} is explored and applied {{to a number of}} interesting problems in quantum physics. The boundary between quantum and classical physics is examined, and demonstration made that quantum histories corresponding to classical equations of motion become more probable for a broad class of models, including linear and nonlinear models of Brownian motion. The link between noise, dissipation, and decoherence is studied. This work is then applied to systems which classically exhibit dissipative chaotic dynamics. A theory is explicated for treating these systems, and the ideas are applied to a particular model of the forced, damped Duffing oscillator, which is chaotic for certain parameter values. Differences between classical and quantum chaos are examined, particularly differences arising in the structure of fractal strange attractors, and the conceptual difficulties in framing standard notions of chaos in a quantum system. A brief discussion of previous work on quantum chaos is included, and the differences between Hamiltonian and dissipative chaos pointed out; a somewhat different interpretation of quantum chaos from the standard one is suggested. A class of histories for quantum systems, in phase space rather than configuration space, is studied. Different ways of representing projections in phase space are discussed, and expressions for the probability of phase space histories are derived; conditions for such histories <b>to</b> <b>decohere</b> are also estimated in the semiclassical limit. ...|$|E
