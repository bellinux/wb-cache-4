5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the camshaft, the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the overhead cam system, where the camshaft is on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> head, is quite common.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{was drawn}} from the boiler to the {{cylinder}} under the piston. When the piston reached the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water, maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to {{the space of the}} cylinder by the connecting passage. External atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> are small, <b>the</b> valve chests may {{be located}} between <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b> For larger <b>cylinders</b> <b>the</b> valve chests are usually on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> but, in early locomotives, they were {{sometimes}} underneath <b>the</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The valve chests {{are usually}} on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> but, in older locomotives, the valve chests were {{sometimes}} located alongside <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and inserted through slots in the frames. This meant that, while <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> were outside, <b>the</b> valves were inside {{and could be}} driven by inside valve gear.|$|R
50|$|For {{improved}} accessibility, {{the steam}} chests were mounted outside <b>the</b> frames instead <b>of</b> between them. <b>The</b> slide valves, operated by Stephenson Link motion, were on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and employed rocker shafts. The balance weight for the Stephenson motion was seldom used on American locomotives {{and was replaced}} by a powerful coiled spring.|$|R
25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum {{on the other side}} of the piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the levers could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine cylinder. A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|E

The [...] "shoulder" [...] is the domed <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> between the parallel section and the pillar valve. For mixed gases, the colours {{can be either}} bands or [...] "quarters".|$|E

At <b>the</b> rear the tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage. The vertical tail was ovoid, with a broad, balanced rudder that extended down to a sizeable ventral fin which also carried a tailskid. The main fixed, conventional undercarriage had wheels on a single axle, mounted to the fuselage by V-struts.|$|R
5000|$|Diesel fuel {{has better}} {{lubrication}} properties than petrol as well. Indeed, in unit injectors, the fuel is employed for three distinct purposes: injector lubrication, injector cooling and injection for combustion. Although spark-ignition engines and their fuel systems {{do not require}} as much lubricity, <b>the</b> higher lubricity <b>of</b> diesel fuel aids in providing lubrication to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and piston rings where it is most needed to resist the high heat, loads and friction resulting from compression and combustion. Because diesel fuels are actually very light oils, excess fuel in <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> and contaminating <b>the</b> crankcase oil is more easily tolerated by diesel engines.|$|R
500|$|Cylinder {{bands are}} straps, usually of {{stainless}} steel, {{which are used}} to clamp two cylinders together as a twin set. [...] The cylinders may be manifolded or independent.

2500|$|What his {{students}} {{saw was a}} long cylinder filled with mercury, immersed in a vessel also filled with mercury. [...] When ammonia was generated through a glass delivery tube, the mercury in the beaker came down into the container vessel. [...] That was when Garner applied the touch of drama. [...] When he placed a stick of activated charcoal into the vessel the tube of the mercury again shot to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E
5000|$|Loading and {{unloading}} were {{effected by}} unscrewing two thick, large-headed knobbed screws at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon's <b>cylinder</b> that allowed <b>the</b> disassembly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon into two halves. <b>The</b> forend and <b>cylinder</b> were <b>the</b> front half and <b>the</b> pistol-grip and <b>cylinder</b> backplate were <b>the</b> back half.|$|R
5000|$|Both <b>the</b> four <b>{{cylinder}}</b> and six cylinder engines had identical cylinders of 3.75 inches bore and stroke.

Intermediate crankshaft bearings were provided between each pair <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b> <b>The</b> inlet valves were automatic on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and <b>the</b> exhaust valves were beneath <b>the</b> <b>cylinders,</b> operated by a camshaft beneath the crankshaft. <b>The</b> engine ratings <b>of</b> 12-16 hp for <b>the</b> four <b>cylinder,</b> and 18-24 for <b>the</b> six <b>cylinder</b> are described as [...] "the lower powers mentioned in both cases are those which can be obtained on the road-wheels under average running conditions - hill-climbing - whilst the higher powers mentioned are those developed by the respective engines on the brake, when running at a speed of 1,000 revs. per min." ...|$|R

60|$|Marco {{observed}} {{that a long}} iron rod, large and solid, and very bright, kept ascending and descending through the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> as if pushed up and drawn down again by some force within. Forester told him {{that that was the}} piston rod.|$|E
60|$|No {{time was}} wasted. Q signalled to R, and R back again, and {{instantly}} the two crabs, each still grasping {{a chain of}} the cylinder, began to sink. On board the Llangaron an order was shouted to let out the cylinder chains; but as these chains had only been made long enough to allow the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> to hang at or a little {{below the surface of}} the water, a foot or two of length was all that could be gained.|$|E
60|$|If the {{cylinder}} {{were left in}} its present position the crab might seize the chains by which it was suspended, while if it were raised it would cease to be a defence. Notwithstanding this latter contingency, the order was quickly given to raise {{the cylinder}}; but before the hoisting engine had been set in motion, Crab Q thrust forward her forceps over the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and held it down.

50|$|Unlike {{the ideal}} Otto cycle engine, the vacuum engine {{relies on a}} {{constant}} heat source provided by burning fuel. As mentioned above, a valve allows an intake <b>of</b> heat into <b>the</b> piston chamber. Estimating the heat in or Qin is constant in the controlled volume space, the ideal gas equation PV = nRT implies an increase in <b>the</b> pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston chamber. After the valve closes, the piston undergoes an adiabatic process during the downward stroke. Once the piston reaches <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> its stroke, <b>the</b> chamber is cooled either by the surrounding air or water, and the resulting Qout forces the pressure in the piston to decrease. The system then undergoes another adiabatic compression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas in the chamber, which is subsequently released by the valve at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder's</b> stroke, while simultaneously allowing new heated gas to enter the chamber.|$|R
50|$|Previous Rekords were {{noteworthy}} for combining eye-catching new {{bodies with}} a robust four cylinder engine that dated back to 1937. By the 1960s the old engine {{was perceived as}} outdated in terms of refinement and sophistication, and with the Rekord B it was replaced. Unlike previous Rekords, the Rekord B featured completely new four cylinder engines, now with a camshaft integrated into <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> head. <b>The</b> units were still not conventional ohc engines since the camshaft was physically located lower than <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> valves. <b>The</b> configuration had been developed by General Motors in Detroit and {{was known as the}} Camshaft in Head (CIH) configuration. The new engines gave the Rekord B a useful performance boost across a range of four cylinder engines which now came in three different sizes, and allowed for <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> increased torque, especially as the engine was developed further during the later 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.|$|R

60|$|It was {{impossible}} for Crabs Q and R {{to operate in the}} usual way. Their massive forceps, lying flat against the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder,</b> could not be twisted.

60|$|There is an {{interesting}} cave {{a mile or two}} below Hannibal, among the bluffs. I would have liked to revisit it, but had not time.

40|$|The flow {{around an}} {{arrangement}} of two-in-tandem cylinders exhibits a remarkably complex behaviour that is of interest for many engineering problems, such as environmental flows or structural design. In the present paper, a Large Eddy Simulation using a staggered Cartesian grid has been performed for the flow around two-in-tandem cylinders of diameter D= 20 mm and height H= 50 mm submerged in an open channel with height h= 60 mm. The two axes have a streamwise spacing <b>of</b> 2 D. <b>The</b> Reynolds number is 1500, based on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> diameter and <b>the</b> free-stream velocity u�.
