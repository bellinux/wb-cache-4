University of Missouri 1911 In {{making a}} {{chemical}} {{study of the}} composition of domestic animals of different ages and on different planes of nutrition, {{it is important to}} make a study of <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> their <b>ash</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> similar animals at birth. This paper will deal with <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new born calf. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work on <b>ash</b> analysis fails to show that any work has been done on <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new born calf. A number of analyses have been made of <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> different parts and organs of various animals and a few analyses have been made of <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> entire animals at birth.

5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed.

In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E

This was shared between her children {{and the children of}} Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg.

5|$|Basing {{the plot}} {{partially}} {{on a story}} told to her by a stranger, Kim began {{an early version of}} 12 Days as a sophomore in college to help herself cope with the end of a relationship. After moving on emotionally with her break-up, she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, United States, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. Following her successful pitch of 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop, she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006. 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen, who decides to drink <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was {{importing}} customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.|$|E

5|$|Following Napoleon's {{defeat in}} 1814 and 1815, the reactionary Congress of Vienna {{determined}} {{that all of}} Europe should consist of strong monarchies (with the exception of Switzerland and a few insignificant republics). In France, the Bourbon dynasty was restored, replaced by the liberal July Monarchy in 1830, before the entire monarchy was again abolished during the Revolutions of 1848. The popular Napoleon III was able to proclaim himself Emperor in 1852, thus founding the Second French Empire. The kingdoms of Sicily and Naples ("Two Sicilies") were absorbed into the kingdom of Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Austria and Prussia vied to unite all German states under their banner, with Prussia emerging victorious in 1866. It succeeded in provoking Napoleon III to declare war, defeat France and absorb the southern German states into the German Empire in the process (1870–71). From <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> the Second Empire rose the French Third Republic, the only great republican European power until World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history.

As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
