50|$|American National Standard <b>Pipe</b> <b>Thread</b> standards, {{often called}} {{national}} <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> standards for short, are U.S. national technical standards for screw threads used on <b>threaded</b> <b>pipes</b> and pipe fittings. They include both tapered and straight thread series for various purposes including rigidity, pressure-tight sealing, or both. The various types are each named with a symbol {{and a full}} name; examples of the symbols include NPT, NPS, NPTF, NPSC, and others.|$|R
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> joints {{are sealed}} with thread seal tape or pipe dope. Many {{plumbing}} fixtures are sealed to their mounting surfaces with plumber's putty.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is slightly conical. Examples are the NPT and BSP series. The seal provided by a <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> joint is created when a tapered externally threaded end is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires {{the application of a}} separate sealant in the joint, such as thread seal tape, or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope, however some <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> joints do not require a separate sealant.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{potential}} problems associated with a cheater bar or snipe, some situations may require an alternative to loosening and removing <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe,</b> screws, bolts or other fasteners.|$|E
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>pipes</b> {{can provide}} an {{effective}} seal for pipes transporting liquids, gases, steam, and hydraulic fluid. These threads are now used in materials other than steel and brass, including PTFE, PVC, nylon, bronze, and cast iron.|$|R
5000|$|In 1864, William Sellers, the {{president}} of Franklin Institute, presented a standard for nuts, bolts, and screws. Out of this effort came the first United States Standard <b>threads,</b> including <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> (See also Screw thread § History of standardization.) ...|$|R
50|$|Outside the United States, some US <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> are found, {{as well as}} many British Standard <b>Pipe</b> <b>threads</b> and ISO 7-1, 7-2, 228-1, and 228-2 threads.|$|R
50|$|The {{self-locking}} {{property is}} also {{key to the}} screw's use {{in a wide range}} of other applications, such as the corkscrew, screw top container lid, <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> joint, vise, C-clamp, and screw jack.|$|E
50|$|Cheater {{bars are}} usually used to free <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe,</b> screws, bolts, and other {{fasteners}} {{that are difficult}} to remove with a ratchet or pipe wrench alone. Cheater bars are also commonly used to operate valves.|$|E
50|$|Power catheads (winches) {{located on}} each side provide the means of {{actuating}} the tongs used to couple and uncouple <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> members. Outboard catheads can be used manually with ropes for various small hoisting jobs around the rig.|$|E
2500|$|The Błyskawica (Lightning) was {{a simple}} submachine gun [...] {{produced}} by the Armia Krajowa, or Home Army, a Polish resistance movement fighting the Germans in occupied Poland. It was produced in underground workshops. Its main feature was its simplicity, so that the weapon could be made even in small workshops, by inexperienced engineers. It used <b>threaded</b> <b>pipes</b> for simplicity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> steel <b>pipe</b> {{is widely}} used in {{buildings}} to convey natural gas or propane fuel, and is a popular choice in fire sprinkler systems due to its resistance to mechanical damage and high heat. <b>Threaded</b> steel <b>pipe</b> may still be used in high-security locations, {{because it is more}} resistant to vandalism, more difficult to remove, and its scrap value is lower than copper or brass.|$|R
25|$|In plumbing, some <b>pipes</b> and <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> {{are still}} {{designated}} in inch sizes due to historic international acceptance of particular sequences of pipe sizes and <b>pipe</b> <b>threads,</b> such as BSP / ISO 7 / EN 10226 threads.|$|R
5000|$|... (a) V thread - These {{are used}} where {{additional}} friction {{is needed to}} make sure the screw remains motionless, such as in setscrews and adjustment screws, and where the joint must be fluid tight as in <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> joints.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{situation}} where neither <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> end can be rotated to tighten or loosen the joint (e.g. in traditional heating pipes running through multiple rooms in a building). In such a case, the coupling will have one right-handed and one left-handed thread.|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic Chain Pipe Wrench- A {{hydraulic}} driven wrench {{which will}} safely remove <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> from other threaded coupling, valve, etc. {{while the other}} devices listed here are for loosening (breaking) nuts. Torque values available vary with size but range up to approximately 75,000 FT-LB.|$|E
5000|$|A regular elbow has {{a female}} hub or FIP {{connection}} on both ends. A hub is a female ABS, PVC or copper pipe receptacle; FIP denotes [...] "Female Iron Pipe" [...] threads, that is, it receives threaded MIP iron, brass or plastic pipe on both ends. FIP {{is also known}} as FPT, Female <b>Pipe</b> <b>Thread,</b> and MIP {{is also known as}} MPT, Male <b>Pipe</b> <b>Thread.</b> Collectively, these are known as National <b>Pipe</b> <b>Thread</b> (NPT) fittings.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively it {{is a short}} {{length of}} pipe with two female National <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> (NPT) (in North American terms, a coupler is a double female while a nipple is double male) or two male or female British {{standard}} <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Assembling <b>threaded</b> steel <b>pipe</b> takes {{skill and}} {{planning}} to allow lengths of pipe to be screwed together in sequence. Most threaded-pipe systems {{require the use}} of strategically located pipe-union fittings in final assembly. <b>Threaded</b> steel <b>pipe</b> is heavy, and requires adequate attachment to support surfaces. Despite its thick walls steel pipe is no longer preferred for conveying drinking water, because corrosion can cause leakage especially at threaded joints, and deposits on internal surfaces will eventually restrict flow.|$|R
5000|$|The pipe {{segments}} (called [...] "joints") {{are typically}} about 40 ft in length, male threaded on each end and connected with short lengths of double-female <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> called couplings. (Some specialty casing is manufactured {{in one piece}} with a female thread machined directly into one end.) ...|$|E
50|$|B16.39- Malleable Iron <b>Threaded</b> <b>Pipe</b> Unions. This Standard covers {{threaded}} {{malleable iron}} unions, classes 150, 250, and 300.It also contains provisions for using steel for NPS 1/8 unions. This Standard includes requirements for design, pressure-temperature ratings, size, marking, materials, joints and seats, threads, hydrostatic strength, tensile strength, air pressure test, sampling, coatings, and dimensions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{threaded}}</b> <b>pipe</b> has a {{screw thread}} at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a pipe wrench.|$|E
50|$|B16.14- Ferrous Pipe Plugs, Bushings, and Locknuts with <b>Pipe</b> <b>Threads.</b> This Standard for Ferrous Pipe Plugs, Bushings, and Locknuts with <b>Pipe</b> <b>Threads</b> covers: (a) pressure-temperature ratings; (b) size; (c) marking; (d) materials; (e) {{dimensions}} and tolerances; (f) threading; and (g) pattern taper.|$|R
50|$|In {{line with}} {{his belief that}} {{structure}} should be made visible, Kahn exposed these structural elements on the building's exterior and in the laboratory ceilings. He also left {{the ceiling of the}} entry porch open so the public could inspect the structure there, including the Vierendeel trusses that Komendant engineered to support each floor. Looking something like ladders turned on their sides, these trusses have large, rectangular openings that make it easy to <b>thread</b> <b>pipes</b> and ductwork into the laboratories.|$|R
5000|$|... {{in older}} installations, <b>threaded</b> brass <b>pipe</b> was {{similarly}} used, {{and was considered}} superior to steel for drinking water, because it was more resistant to corrosion.|$|R
50|$|Petroleum-based {{pipe dope}} is not {{intended}} for use on threaded PVC, CPVC or ABS pipe and fittings since it will deteriorate the plastic. Builders in the US are expected to use thread compounds that meet ASTM F2331 - Standard Test Method for Determining Chemical Compatibility of Thread Sealants with Thermoplastic <b>Threaded</b> <b>Pipe</b> and Fittings Materials or thread seal tape on PVC, CPVC and ABS threads.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pipe clamp}} {{is a type}} of clamp often {{employed}} in woodworking, piping or cabinet shops. When referring to woodwork or cabinet shops, pipe clamps are usually composed of commercially manufactured clamp heads or [...] "jaws" [...] and a length of common <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe.</b> The capacity of the clamp is determined by the length of the pipe used. When referring to piping, pipe clamps are used to connect the pipe to the pipe hanger assembly.|$|E
50|$|By 1918 the {{original}} steam heating system {{had begun to}} fail after 30 years of use. Bids were taken and in August 1918 a contract was signed with a local plumbing firm for the installation of a completely new hot water heating system was installed based on the what was then new Durham system of <b>threaded</b> <b>pipe</b> and cast iron fittings. Only {{the original}} boiler was retained {{as part of the}} heating modification, which was completed that same fall.|$|E
