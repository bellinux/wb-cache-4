5|$|During World War I, the German {{government}} {{hoped to}} destabilize British rule over India by spreading {{rumors that the}} British were unable to redeem for silver all of the paper currency they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of silver, caused the price of silver to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase silver to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 silver dollars at $1 per ounce of silver plus {{the value of the}} copper in the coins, and handling and <b>transportation</b> <b>fees.</b> Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new silver dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from silver purchased from American mining companies.|$|E

25|$|The Nationalist Chinese had {{suffered}} 70 killed in action. Abandoning their dead, 24 machine guns, and their dead mules, they also fled the bombing, headed north up the Lao {{bank of the}} Mekong towards Burma because they lacked boats for a river crossing. Ten kilometers upon their way, they were blocked by the RLA infantry troops. A fortnight's impasse ensued, during which additional Lao troops flown in from Vientiane helped encircle the outnumbered KMT. The dispute was settled when Ouane {{struck a deal with}} the leaders of the caravan. According to one account, he would pay them only the customary <b>transportation</b> <b>fees</b> for the opium. Another version says that the Chinese paid $7,500 to Rattikone as a departure fee. Either way, essentially the Lao general gained an enormous amount of free opium when his paratroopers gathered it from the battlefield and shipped it to Ban Houei Sai. Ouane had had his sawmill bombarded, and his heroin refinery had burnt down during the fighting. However, he reputedly still had five more refineries working nearby. Ouane's damages were far outweighed by his gains.|$|E

40|$|<b>Transportation</b> impact <b>fees</b> are the {{contributions}} of investors {{in the cost of}} the needed infrastructure for their developments. The growth of Dubai {{during the past few years}} has been phenomenal. Accordingly, the need for highway infrastructure has been increasing rapidly. To provide some guidelines for calculating the <b>transportation</b> impact <b>fees,</b> Dubai‟s Roads & Transport Authority, RTA, issued Law # 6 in 2006, which provides the basis and legal cover for charging equitable impact <b>fees</b> for <b>transportation</b> projects to the beneficiaries of the projects. However, a detailed mechanism that covers the technical aspects in calculating impact fees is still not standardized in Dubai. The lack of clear procedure for calculating the <b>transportation</b> impact <b>fees</b> has created many disputes between RTA and transportation consultants in the city.

Six different procedures for <b>transportation</b> impact <b>fee</b> estimation were identified and tested. These procedures include the RTA proposed methodology or the “Developmen...|$|R

The substantial characteristics of household attributes among life stage categories are taken into consideration. The analysis was performed using Stochastic Frontier Model, and the concept of production frontier is adopted to estimate transportation expenditure frontier (TEF). TEFs are treated as unobserved production frontier that influences the actual <b>transportation</b> <b>fee</b> expenditure observed in transportation survey. By utilizing data sets provided by Study on Integrated Transportation Master Plan (SITRAMP, 2004) in Jakarta, households which include person who commute to the target area were extracted. TEFs were estimated for each household life stage category in order to investigate the different constraints of them. From the comparison analysis of TEFs, it was shown that considerable differences in average of TEFs among them in particular larger amount of TEFs is found for single-person and families only with adults. These results mean that the TEF is influenced by household attributes and life environments...|$|R
