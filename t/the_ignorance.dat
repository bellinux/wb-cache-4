5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E

Marco Porcio Catón exposed <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of the pseudointellectuals of Quito. La ciencia blancardina, in which Espejo claimed to be the author of the previous two works, condemned the results of the clergy's educational system: ignorance and affectation. All three works caused polemic.|$|E

5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of the sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect phallus, urdhvalinga) beggar Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their clothes to fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini—Vishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, abused and cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (phallus) should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a beggar in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow – by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked smeared with ash – declaring that such a lifestyle would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{investigates the}} limits of <b>the</b> willful <b>ignorance</b> {{doctrine}} as employed in federal criminal law. This foundational rule allows willfully ignorant defendants {{to be treated as}} knowing wrongdoers. <b>The</b> willful <b>ignorance</b> doctrine is of increasing importance at the moment in light of the mens rea reform bills currently working their way through Congress. This legislation seeks to establish some form of knowledge as the default mens rea in federal law. Thus, if some version of this law is passed, <b>the</b> willful <b>ignorance</b> doctrine will provide a partial work-around. Motivated by the central role of <b>the</b> willful <b>ignorance</b> doctrine in federal prosecutions for a range of crimes-from drug offenses to white-collar crime-this Article analyzes a tension between the way federal courts justify the doctrine and the way they apply it. In particular, the Article argues that courts are committed to expanding the doctrine beyond the limits within which it is currently applied. The law allows willful ignorance to substitute for knowledge on the theory that these two mental states are equally culpable. This Article argues that, as a result, the law is also committed to allowing some forms of egregious non-willful ignorance-most importantly, reckless ignorance-to substitute for knowledge when the conditions of equal culpability are met. Moving beyond <b>the</b> traditional willful <b>ignorance</b> doctrine is especially important in order to combat the incentives that lawyers, accountants, and other white-collar professionals have to remain in ignorance of fraud committed by their clients. While <b>the</b> existing willful <b>ignorance</b> doctrine is responsive to conscious efforts to remain in ignorance of fraud in one's midst, the criminal law does not have sufficient doctrinal tools to counteract the incentives to recklessly allow one's ignorance to be preserved. This is the gap that <b>the</b> Iterated Reckless <b>Ignorance</b> Principle defended here is meant to fill...|$|R

His first book, on the Philosophy and Phenomenology of the Body, was completed in 1950.

25|$|While Acemoglu and Robinson {{attribute}} {{economic growth}} to institutions, {{there are other}} possible explanations, including geography, culture, and <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of leaders. The alternative theories below are alternatives for the general framework posed by the book, rather than for {{either of the two}} theories above. Though these theories all try to claim a major factor that drives economic development, they are not mutually exclusive. For example, geography does shape the natural resources available to a country. For example, a country given rich resources has the potential to become rich. On the other side, institutions determine how those resources are distributed and create incentives for different groups to be motivated to participate in economic development.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ignorance</b> fallacy is {{sometimes}} confused (or combined) with logically valid contrapositive arguments. Contrapositive arguments rightly utilize the transposition rule of inference in classical logic to conclude something like: To {{the extent that}} C implies E then Not-E must also imply Not-C. In other words, if a cause always leads to an effect, then absence of the expected effect is evidence of absence of the cause. For example, if the causal proposition that If it's raining outside then the streets will be wet is assumed, then it can be assumed that if the streets are not wet then it is not raining outside. The inference that it cannot be raining outside because the streets are not getting wet is exactly as true, or perhaps exactly as untrue, as the original proposition. The statements are logically equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Faulknor took Mercury {{out to the}} West Indies and {{remained}} with her until 1762. He then appears to have spent some time without a ship, for he is not recorded as commanding another vessel until 1767, when he took command of the 74-gun , the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir John Moore. Superb was the Portsmouth guardship at this time, and Faulknor commanded her during Moore's time as Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. She carried out some other duties however, including being sent out to the Mediterranean to convey troops stationed at Menorca back to Britain. While entering the harbour at Cork, she ran aground through <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of her pilot.

25|$|The fifth Hope Bus was {{announced}} on 25 September, with the upcoming event {{to take place}} on 8 October.

In a joint press conference at Busan City Hall on 26 September, Busan mayor Hur Nam-sik and Busan City Council chairman Jae Jong-mo (제종모) announced {{their opposition to the}} fifth Hope Bus event. Hur and Jae's given reasoning was that the four prior buses were detrimental to solving the labor crisis, and had done great damage to the citizens of Busan. Furthermore, Hur and Jae asserted that stopping the Hope Bus event would contribute {{to the success of the}} film festival. The conservative Advancement Unification Party was against the fifth Hope Bus event as well. In a statement on 27 September, party spokesperson Yoon Hyeon-yeon (윤혜연) blamed government incompetence and <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of Hope Bus participants towards the concerns of the local citizens of Busan for the ongoing Hanjin Heavy Industries crisis. Yoon maintained that the presence of a fifth Hope Bus event would present traffic dangers as well as a black mark on the international reputation of South Korea.|$|E
40|$|Skeptical puzzles and {{arguments}} often employ knowledge-closure principles. Epistemologists widely {{believe that an}} adequate reply to the skeptic should explain why her reasoning is appealing albeit misleading; but it’s unclear what would explain {{the appeal of the}} skeptic’s closure principle, if not for its truth. In this paper, I aim to challenge the widespread commitment to knowledge-closure. But I proceed by first examining a new puzzle about failing to know—what I call <b>the</b> New <b>Ignorance</b> Puzzle. This puzzle resembles to <b>the</b> Old <b>Ignorance</b> Puzzle, although it does not involve a closure principle. It instead centers on the standard view of ignorance, a highly intuitive principle stating that ignorance is merely a failure to know.

I then use this solution to <b>the</b> New <b>Ignorance</b> Puzzle as a way of explaining why knowledge-closure principles would seem true, and why abominable conjunctions would seem abominable, even if such principles were false. The upshot is a new way of explaining why the skeptic’s reasoning is appealing albeit misleadin...|$|R

25|$|When it was {{determined}} to carry on operations on the eastern coast of Spain, Jones was appointed commanding engineer under General Maitland, and sailed from Lisbon {{in the beginning of}} June. On the disembarkation of the troops at Alicante, Jones received an appointment on the staff as assistant quartermaster-general, there being already an engineer officer senior to himself in command of the engineers. Owing to differences between the commanders of the allied forces, Jones was sent on a special mission to Madrid, to explain to Wellington the position of affairs. Travelling by night and avoiding roads, Jones reached Madrid safely, and was warmly received by Wellington, who, sending instructions by a courier, kept Jones to accompany him to the north to the siege of Burgos. During the progress of that siege, Jones was instructed to signal to Wellington by holding up his hat when the arrangements for exploding a mine and making a lodgment were complete. As the signal was not acknowledged, Jones repeated it until the French perceived him, and their fire brought him down with a bullet through his ankle. He with difficulty rolled himself into the parallel, but he ordered the mine to be fired, and the operations entrusted to him were successfully carried out before he left the field. Jones remained in a state of delirium for ten days, {{and as soon as he}} could be moved Wellington sent him to Lisbon in the only spring wagon at headquarters. The sufferings of this two months' journey severely tried his strength, and he remained in Lisbon until April 1813, when he was sent to England. Eighteen months of severe suffering followed. During this period he composed and published a volume entitled Journal of Sieges carried on by the Allies in Spain in 1810, 1811, and 1812. In this work he fearlessly exposed the deficiencies of the engineer service, which he attributed to <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> and military incapacity of the board of ordnance. These strictures naturally offended the dispensers of patronage. Wellington, however, although the book was published without his sanction, and sharply criticised his siege proceedings, praised it, and remained the author's friend.|$|E
25|$|Iranians {{immediately}} {{sought to}} strengthen their position and finally subject the rebellious Kingdoms of Eastern Georgia and making them integral parts of the empire. During the next 150 years as Persian subjects, various Georgian kings and nobles rose into rebellion, while at many other times political activity was nothing but dormant, and many kings and aristocrats fully accepted Persian overlordship and converted to Islam as well, for greater boons from their Iranian Shahs. On the maternal side of the Safavid (also Qajar) and the Ottoman Turkish dynasty, many members were from Georgian aristocratic or different lines. In the early 17th century Shah Abbas I made a punitive campaign into his Georgian territories after being informed that Teimuraz I of Kakheti {{with a couple of}} Christian citizens assaulted the Karabakh governor and killed him. Shah Abbas decided to confront him but Teimuraz I fled to Georgia towards Ahmed I, in order to shelter from Safavid forces. This event brought an end to the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha signed between the Ottomans and the Safavids. In 1616, Abbas I dispatched his troops to Georgia. He aimed to suppress the Georgian revolt in Tbilisi, however the Safavid soldiers met heavy resistance by the citizens of Tbilisi. Enraged, Shah Abbas ordered a massacre of the public. A large number of Georgian soldiers and people were killed and as many as between 130,000 and 200,000 Georgians from Kakheti were deported to Persia. During the same conflict, Teimuraz sent the Queen mother, Ketevan, as a negotiator to Abbas, but in an act of revenge for the recalcitrance of Teimuraz, he ordered the queen to renounce Christianity, and upon her refusal, had her tortured to death. By the 17th century, both eastern and western Georgia had sunk into poverty {{as the result of the}} constant warfare. The economy was so bad that barter replaced the use of money and the populations of the cities declined markedly. The French traveller Jean Chardin, who visited the region of Mingrelia in 1671, noted the wretchedness of the peasants, the arrogance of the nobles and <b>the</b> <b>ignorance</b> of the clergy. The various rulers in Georgia were thus often split between acknowledging Ottoman or Iranian overlordship (which often entailed nominal conversion to Islam) or making a bid for independence. The emergence of a third imperial power to the north, Christian Russia, made the latter an increasingly tempting choice.|$|E
