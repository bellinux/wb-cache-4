5|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Nuclear Reactor Building was renamed to the More Hall Annex to deter burglary, after a request from <b>the</b> <b>NRC.</b> Formal {{decommissioning}} of the site, including a $4 million cleanup, began in April 2006, amid student protests over the contractor hired for the work. <b>The</b> <b>NRC</b> formally terminated the university's license to operate the reactor in May 2007.|$|E
5|$|Three Mile Island is J. Samuel Walker's fourth book as the {{official}} historian of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). In the book's preface, Walker tells readers that he had complete independence in its authorship—that <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> placed no restrictions on what could be said. However, Walker provides a historical account and does not assess the performance of <b>the</b> <b>NRC.</b>|$|E
5|$|Walker {{suggests}} that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology, the nuclear industry, and <b>the</b> <b>NRC.</b> Critics faulted the industry and <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> for their poor performance {{both before and after}} the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt was}} made to provide the {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>NRC</b> refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.|$|E
5|$|When PermaGrain went bankrupt, about 100,000curies of cobalt-60 were {{abandoned}} at the reactor facility, {{which was now}} {{under the control of}} Pennsylvania's government. The DEP assumed responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> license and legacy contamination. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), working with <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> and state, removed the cobalt-60 from the site for disposal at the low-level radioactive waste facility in Barnwell, South Carolina in September 2003. Scientech continued decontamination work and demolished the hot cells; much of this work was done robotically, with financial aid from the Department of Energy.|$|E

5|$|After the {{accidental}} release, another radiological survey was performed, {{and the state}} government concluded that PermaGrain needed to be relocated. The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{agencies}} which funded AI research (such as the British government, DARPA and NRC) became {{frustrated with}} the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected research into AI.

5|$|Reactor {{operators}} {{were not}} trained {{to deal with}} accident conditions, and <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> had not established effective communication with utilities. Moreover, once the accident occurred, the lines of authority proved to be ill defined. The public received conflicting reports that caused needless panic and evacuations. It was these systemic weaknesses in the regulatory system that allowed gifted people to make the mistakes they did.|$|E
5|$|Canada was an {{alternative}} source of heavy water. Cominco {{had been involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July by a letter from Hugh Taylor, a British-born scientist working at Princeton University, on behalf of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Taylor offered a NDRC contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 per pound.|$|E

5|$|Hans von Halban {{had proved}} to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with Mackenzie or <b>the</b> <b>NRC.</b> The Americans saw him as a {{security}} risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI). In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R. Steacie became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} was to broach the matter with the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir John Anderson, as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who had been involved in Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of <b>the</b> <b>NRC,</b> who enthusiastically supported the proposal.

5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} appraisal {{of the cost of}} the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through <b>the</b> <b>NRC,</b> with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|Tiny {{amounts of}} 210Po are {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically {{of the order of}} , in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by <b>the</b> <b>NRC</b> and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of 210Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the alpha radiation (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard. According to United Nuclear, they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year.|$|E
40|$|The United States {{military}} strategy is currently focusing on Major Regional Conflicts (MRCs), {{rather than on}} a single, major war. <b>The</b> Plural <b>NRC</b> model, PaMM, is an integer programming model and solution procedure that develops deployment schedules for active duty Army combat divisions to two nearly simultaneous MRCs without perfect information regarding <b>the</b> second <b>NRC.</b> PaMM develops <b>the</b> deployment schedules using a sequential heuristic: It first solves the optimal deployment schedules for a single NRC, fixes all movement that occurs before the hypothesized start date of a second <b>NRC,</b> and solves <b>the</b> resulting problem for both <b>NRCs.</b> <b>The</b> sequential technique is robust: Using a hypothetical scenario where all divisions for <b>the</b> first <b>NRC</b> are required within the first 30 days, PaMM is run six times, varying the time difference between the start dates of <b>the</b> <b>NRCs</b> form 10 to 60 days.
