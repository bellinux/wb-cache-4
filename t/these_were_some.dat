Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E
5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of {{scientists}} from various other fields contributed {{to the study of}} plants and animals in India. Among <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> who worked in interdisciplinary areas. Foremost among these was J. B. S. Haldane, the British scientist who encouraged field biology in India on the basis that it was useful {{while at the same time}} requiring low investment unlike other branches of science. He was among the first to popularise quantitative approaches to biology in India.|$|E
25|$|From the 8th to the 10th century, three dynasties contested {{for control}} of {{northern}} India: the Gurjara Pratiharas of Malwa, the Palas of Bengal, and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan. The Sena dynasty would later assume control of the Pala Empire, and the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states, notably the Paramaras of Malwa, the Chandelas of Bundelkhand, the Kalachuris of Mahakoshal, the Tomaras of Haryana, and the Chauhans of Rajputana. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the earliest Rajput kingdoms. One Gurjar Rajput of the Chauhan clan, Prithvi Raj Chauhan, was known for bloody conflicts against the advancing Turkic sultanates. While Chandela Rajput dynasty is credited for the Khajuraho Temple Complex, famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 a magnitude-6.6 {{earthquake}} in San Fernando caused some {{damage to the}} Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating {{from the early days}} of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the first reinforced concrete buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much reinforcing bar had been embedded in the concrete) to be sure they were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large wrecking ball was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.|$|E

25|$|She taught art {{classes at}} various Bay Area locations, such as UC Berkeley Extension, Mills College, and the California Labor School. She also {{taught at the}} {{innovative}} California School of Fine Arts, alongside abstract expressionists such as Clyfford Still, who would become a close friend and artistic influence, and Richard Diebenkorn. In 1934, she created an abstract fresco at Oakland's Piedmont High School. This {{was part of the}} Federal Art Project, which strongly preferred paintings depicting American scenes, but some abstracts such as this work by Falkenstein were tolerated. During the 1930s she created sculptures from clay ribbons formed into Möbius strips, woven together. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the earliest American nonobjective sculptures. Her series of wooden sculptures called Exploded Volumes date from {{the first half of the}} 1940s. These were made of movable parts that could be combined in different ways by the viewer.|$|E

[...] This was followed by Anthozoa, a dress developed in collaboration with fashion designer Iris van Herpen and materials engineer Craig Carter. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the first examples of multi-color and multi-material 3D printing a human scale, using a bright palette with fine granular control of color and texture. [...] In 2015, she designed the Wanderers collection with Christoph Bader and Dominik Kolb, inspired by ideas of interplanetary exploration. That earned Fast Company's award for Design Innovation. The most influential of the Wanderers was the Living Mushtari chestpiece, a model digestive tract filled with liquid and a colony of photosynthetic bacteria and E. Coli. [...] Producing Mushtari required new modeling methods for printing long flexible tubes with varying thickness.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the {{diagnostic}} criteria for schizophrenia were {{the subject of}} a number of controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria used today. It became clear after the 1971 US–UK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in America than in Europe. This was partly due to looser diagnostic criteria in the US, which used the DSM-II manual, contrasting with Europe and its ICD-9. David Rosenhan's 1972 study, published in the journal Science under the title [...] "On being sane in insane places", concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the US was often subjective and unreliable. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the factors leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the revision of the whole DSM manual, resulting in the publication of the DSM-III in 1980.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to her jazz-influenced former album, Winehouse's focus {{shifted to the}} girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up {{in the studio and}} on tour. Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music. In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as [...] "You Know I'm No Good" [...] and [...] "Rehab" [...] appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of [...] "Pumps" [...] and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work. She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard. Promotion of Back to Black soon began and, in early October 2006 Winehouse's official website was relaunched with a new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs. Back to Black was released in the UK on 30 October 2006. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks in February. In the US, it entered at number seven on the Billboard 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007, selling 1.85million copies {{over the course of the}} year.|$|E

2500|$|The Iron Curtain took {{physical}} {{shape in}} the form of border defenses between the countries of western and eastern Europe. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called [...] "inner German border" [...] – commonly known as die Grenze in German – between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the Berlin Wall was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.|$|E
