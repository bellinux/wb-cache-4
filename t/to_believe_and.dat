After Itachi's death, the two actors noted that in the end Itachi served as a good old brother to Sasuke.

5|$|Some Muslims, {{especially}} those living near the southern coast, took {{the option of}} exile, but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims. The population converted en masse, and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity. The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate. These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the Moriscos. As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, sending their children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of food and beverages forbidden by Islamic law.|$|E

5|$|The German attack caught {{large numbers}} of Soviet Air Force {{aircraft}} on the ground. Faulty tactics – sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically unsound formations – accounted for many more. Kesselring reported {{that in the first}} week of operations Luftflotte 2 had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air and on the ground. Even Göring found these figures hard <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo over the front in his Focke-Wulf Fw 189.|$|E
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> hope.

The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war.

25|$|For Unger, society emerges {{not through}} {{compromise}} or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle {{for control of}} political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls formative context. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> act as if their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They {{come to see the}} existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this false necessity. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls negative capability.|$|E

500|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{remarks that}} [...] "the more simple and {{straightforward}} a good {{character in a}} fairy tale, {{the easier it is}} for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other." [...] The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character is a very good person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in [...] "Puss in Boots") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment.|$|E
2500|$|Voltaire {{explained}} {{that no matter}} how far someone is tempted with rewards to believe in Christian salvation, the result will be at best a faint belief.

2500|$|Using {{an interpretive}} {{principle}} {{known as the}} day-year principle, Miller, along with others, interpreted a prophetic [...] "day" [...] to read not as a 24-hour period, {{but rather as a}} calendar year.

2500|$|The Reformed {{position}} is frequently {{contrasted with the}} Arminian doctrine of conditional election in which God's eternal choice to save a person is conditioned on God’s certain foreknowledge of future events, namely, that certain individuals would freely exercise faith and trust in response to God's offer of salvation. The Arminian doctrine agrees that the influence of sin has so inhibited the individual's volition {{that no one is}} willing or able to come to or follow God, but the Arminian doctrine of prevenient (or [...] "enabling") grace is considered sufficient to enable a person <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> repent before regeneration.|$|E

In response, a group of marriage advocates filed what became Initiative 957 which, if passed, would have made procreation a legal requirement for marriage in Washington State.

2500|$|In {{response}} to {{demands for a}} German liturgy, Luther wrote a German Mass, which he published in early 1526. He did not intend it {{as a replacement for}} his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the [...] "simple people", a [...] "public stimulation for people <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> become Christians." [...] Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted [...] "everything that smacks of sacrifice", and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread. He retained the elevation of the host and chalice, while trappings such as the Mass vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 8 also {{describes}} Christ's sacrificial {{death as}} satisfying God's justice and attaining both humanity's reconciliation with God and everlasting {{life for the}} elect. Salvation is granted to individuals {{by means of the}} word of God and the Holy Spirit, who persuades them <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> obey. Chapter 9 teaches that man's will is free, and that because of the fall, man lost the ability to do anything spiritually pleasing to God, and man's will became enslaved to his sinful nature. Man, after conversion, regains the ability to please God and to choose good, but sin remains within. [...] Complete sinless perfection is only attainable after death in the state of glorification.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis for}} Soloveitchik's ruling was not {{narrowly}} legal, but sociological and historical. He described the traditional Jewish–Christian relationship {{as one of}} [...] "the few and weak vis-à-vis the many and the strong", {{one in which the}} Christian community historically denied the right of the Jewish community <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> live in their own way. His response was written in the light of past Jewish-Christian religious disputations, which traditionally had been forced upon the Jewish community. Those had as their express goal the conversion of Jews to Christianity. As recently as the 1960s many traditional Jews still looked upon all interfaith dialogue with suspicion, fearing that conversion may be an ulterior motive. This was a reasonable belief, given that many Catholics and most Protestants at the time in fact held this position. Reflecting this stance, Rabbi Soloveitchik asked the Christian community to respect [...] "the right of the community of the few to live, create and worship in its own way, in freedom and with dignity." ...|$|E
