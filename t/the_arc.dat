5|$|He died 8 May 1828 in Ville-au-Val and was buried, as {{were his}} {{descendants}} after him, {{in the family}} vault near the chateau chapel. His name is engraved on <b>the</b> <b>Arc</b> d'Triumph.|$|E
5|$|The Case Closed anime adapted <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> into episodes 616–621 and was {{broadcast}} on Nippon Television Network System between May 21, 2011 and June 25, 2011. The episodes were {{the top six}} watched anime during its run. <b>The</b> <b>arc</b> follows Shinichi Kudo as he visits London and becomes involved in a bombing case. In {{the beginning of the}} series, Shinichi was poisoned and turned into a child. Since then, he had been using the identity Conan Edogawa whilst keeping his true identity a secret.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arc</b> {{initially}} {{ran from}} October 2004 to February 2005 in Japan on TV Tokyo. The first English airing {{of the series}} was from September 2006 until January 2007.

5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and <b>the</b> <b>Arc</b> de Triomphe, as it could now be seen that the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, <b>the</b> <b>Arc</b> de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E

40|$|A {{sizeable}} {{fraction of}} the electron created in the muon storage ring have an energy not far {{from that of the}} muons. Therefore a part of those electrons emitted in the straight sections can propagate along the section and get lost in the first elements of <b>the</b> <b>arcs.</b> <b>The</b> associated power loss is estimated to be substantially larger than that associated with the local muon decay in the first elements of <b>the</b> <b>arcs.</b> It is important to take this power into account {{in the design of the}} cooling of these elements in order to avoid hot spots in <b>the</b> <b>arcs...</b>|$|R

30|$|Complexity: It is in P {{because it}} can be reformulated as a {{circulation}} problem: let f(e)= 1,g(e)= 1 if e∈A 1 and f(e)= 0,g(e)= 1 if e∈A 0. This way <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> of A 1 are forced and <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> of A 0 can be chosen if necessary.|$|R
5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} current output, {{ensuring that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain some distance from <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to <b>the</b> <b>arc,</b> the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of}} the weld.|$|E
5|$|Also, Newton {{describes}} QR as the {{versed sine}} of <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> with P at its centre and length twice QP. Although {{this is not}} strictly {{the same as the}} QR that he has in the diagram (Fig.1), in the limit, they become equal.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanism}} is proposed explaining the structures consisting of plasma arcs, as observed in X-ray photographs of solar active regions. It {{is suggested that}} the width of <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> corresponds to <b>the</b> cut-off wavelength of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability which develops due to a difference in density between the plasma in <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> and <b>the</b> plasma in the surrounding region. The transverse component of the magnetic field necessary to stabilize the instability at a wavelength corresponding to the width of <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> {{is estimated to be}} of the order of 0. 1 gauss...|$|R
30|$|The LBCs of all <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> can be {{calculated}} by slightly modifying the Brandes-Newman algorithm (Brandes 2001; Newman 2001): For each arc f, we construct the shortest path tree with respect to lateral paths and run the algorithm to calculate the contribution to LBC of shortest lateral paths starting from all <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> and ending at f. The time complexity to calculate LBCf for all <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> f in G is O(|A| 2) or O(|N| 2) for sparse networks. The same holds for the calculation of IBCs or OBCs of all the nodes.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study polynomials (Pn) which are {{hermitian}} orthogonal on two <b>arcs</b> of <b>the</b> unit circle {{with respect to}} weight functions which have square root singularities at the end points of <b>the</b> <b>arcs,</b> an arbitrary nonvanishing trigonometric polynomial A in the denominator and possible point measures at the zeros of A. First we give an explicit representation of the orthogonal polynomials Pn in terms of elliptic functions. With the help of this representation for sufficiently large n the number of zeros of Pn which are in an ε-neighbourhood of each of <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> are determined. Finally, it is shown that the accumulation points of the zeros of (Pn) which are not attracted to the support lie on a Jordan <b>arc</b> running within <b>the</b> unit disk from one of <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> to <b>the</b> other one. The accumulation points lie dense on <b>the</b> Jordan <b>arc</b> if <b>the</b> harmonic measures of <b>the</b> <b>arcs</b> are irrational. If the harmonic measures are rational then {{there is only a}} finite set of accumulation points on <b>the</b> Jordan <b>arc...</b>|$|R
5|$|Culturally, the {{campaign}} captured the public imagination in Britain and France: the Battle of Grand Port {{is the only}} naval battle that appears on <b>the</b> <b>Arc</b> de Triomphe, while in Britain Rowley and Bertie were both made baronets for their services in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{served on}} the board of {{directors}} of Erhard Seminars Training (EST). Several key ARC personnel were also involved. Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social cohesion of <b>the</b> <b>ARC</b> community.|$|E
5|$|Ferino {{commanded}} the southern-most wing of Army of the Danube in 1799, {{and participated in}} the battles of Ostrach and Stockach. Napoleon awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1804; in 1805, Ferino became a Senator, and in 1808, raised him to Count of the Empire. His name is engraved in <b>the</b> <b>Arc</b> de Triomphe.|$|E

50|$|The Hidaka Mountains {{formed in}} the late Quaternary as part of <b>the</b> outer <b>arc</b> of <b>the</b> western end of <b>the</b> Kuril Island <b>Arc.</b> They were formed by the uplift {{resulting}} from the collision with <b>the</b> Kuril <b>arc</b> and <b>the</b> Northeast Japan <b>Arc.</b> <b>The</b> Hidaka mountains no longer appear to be uplifting.|$|R
5000|$|The Higurashi When They Cry Kai ("When Cicadas Cry Solutions") games form {{what are}} known as <b>the</b> answer <b>arcs.</b> <b>The</b> last four games {{released}} in the series, were, in contrast to <b>the</b> question <b>arcs,</b> meant to answer all of the questions presented {{in the first half of}} <b>the</b> series. These <b>arcs</b> can be considered the [...] "solutions" [...] of <b>the</b> previous <b>arcs.</b> Each answer arc game contains all of <b>the</b> previous answer <b>arcs.</b>|$|R
5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make <b>the</b> <b>arc.</b> <b>The</b> <b>arc</b> is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, <b>the</b> <b>arc,</b> or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by <b>the</b> <b>arc.</b> In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method in which <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants {{in the atmosphere}} are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E
5000|$|Every pair of {{distinct}} points on a circle determines two <b>arcs.</b> If <b>the</b> two points {{are not directly}} opposite each other, one of these <b>arcs,</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>arc,</b> will subtend an angle at {{the centre of the}} circle that is less than [...] radians (180 degrees), and <b>the</b> other <b>arc,</b> <b>the</b> major <b>arc,</b> will subtend an angle greater than [...] radians.|$|R
