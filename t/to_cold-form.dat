40|$|Cold-formed steel purlins are {{commonly}} used {{in the construction of}} industrial buildings. The roof sheeting increases the strength of the attached purlin to a considerable extent by providing lateral and rotational restraints. Further, the rotational restraint plays an important role on the buckling behaviour of the attached purlin. There is a need for a design method that accurately predicts the rotational restraint without experimental tests. Addressing this problem, in this research work, a non-linear finite element model is developed to estimate the rotational restraint provided by the first and second generation trapezoidal sheeting to the attached purlin. This model is applicable to trough-fixed and crest-fixed single skin purlin-sheeting systems commonly employed in steel roofs.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{structural}} performance between thin-walled timber and FRP-timber composite Cee-sections. While, thin-walled composite timber structures {{have been proven}} to be efficient and ultra-light structural elements, their manufacturing is difficult and labour intensive. Significant effort and time is required to prevent the cracking of the transverse timber veneers, bent in the grain direction, when forming the cross-sectional shape. FRP-timber structures overcome this disadvantage by replacing the transverse veneers with flexible, unidirectional FRP material and only keeping the timber veneers which are bent in their natural rolling direction. The Cee-sections investigated {{in this study were}} 210 mm deep × 90 mm wide × 500 mm high and manufactured from five plies. For both section types, the three internal plies were thin (1 mm thick) softwood Hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) veneers, orientated along the section longitudinal axis. The two outer layers, providing bending stiffness to the walls, were Hoop pine veneers (1 mm thick) for the timber sections and glass fibre reinforced plastic (0. 73 mm thick) for the FRP-timber sections orientated perpendicular to the inner layers. The manufacturing process is briefly introduced in this paper. The profiles were fitted with strain gauges and tested in compression. Linear Variable Displacement Transducers also recorded the buckling along one flange. The test results are presented and discussed in this paper in regards to their structural behaviour and performance. Results showed that the use of FRP in the sections increases both the elastic local buckling load and section capacity, the latter being increased by about 24 percent.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensCold-formed steel {{has become}} a {{preferred}} building material for structural farming in {{many different types of}} structures, commonly for repetitive members such as floor joists, roof rafters, roof trusses and wall studs. For wood framed structures with repetitive members, a repetitive member factor increases the allowable bending stress from 1. 00 to 1. 50 times the reference design value, depending on both the type of material and the type of load. Currently, however, the bending strength of cold-formed steel repetitive members is not permitted to be increased, even though the method of framing is quite similar to that of wood except for the material properties. Typical light-frame wood construction consists of floor, roof, and wall systems, each with repetitive members connected by sheathing. A repetitive system is one of at least three members that are spaced not farther apart than 24 -inches. These members must also be joined by a load distributing element adequate to support the design load. The behavior of the individual members, then, is affected by inclusion into this system. Additionally, the connected sheathing increases the bending capacity of bending members due to both composite action and load sharing. Composite action is a result of T-beam-like action between the repetitive member and connected sheathing, but is limited by nail slippage in the connection. Secondly, due to differential deflection between the members, sheathing is also able to distribute loads from weaker, more flexible members to the more rigid and stronger members. This effect is known as load-sharing. The same general principles of repetitive use should apply <b>to</b> <b>cold-formed</b> steel due <b>to</b> its similarity to wood construction. Accordingly, this paper conducts a preliminary study of the effects of both composite action and load-sharing in cold-formed steel assemblies and subsequently recommends using a repetitive member factor for cold-formed steel members...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide the stiffness and strength characteristics for cold-formed steel stud walls stabilized by sheathing. The primary stability resistance is provided by translational (lateral) stiffness supplied at the fastener locations <b>to</b> the <b>cold-formed</b> steel studs. This paper separates the source of this translational stiffness into two parts: local and diaphragm. To analyze the local stiffness an experimental study consisting of small-scale stud-fastener-sheathing assemblies is conducted. In these tests sheathing type, stud spacing, fastener spacing, edge distance, environmental conditions, and construction flaws are all varied. The results provide characterization of the local stiffness and strength that is supplied as the fasteners bear and rotate in a stud-sheathing assembly. Results are sensitive to the design variables (stud, fastener, sheathing, spacing) as well as the environmental and construction conditions. Diaphragm stiffness develops as the sheathing itself undergoes shear, which also translates into a lateral resistance at the fastener locations. A simple analytical model for the translational stiffness supplied by the sheathing diaphragm action is proposed and validated. The importance of including both local and diaphragm stiffness is illustrated with a test on a full-scale cold-formed steel stud wall. For the first time, this paper provides a comprehensive bracing model for sheathing-braced stud walls which include both local and diaphragm stiffness. ...|$|R

40|$|Storage rack {{systems are}} {{structures}} composed of cold-formed steel structural members {{that are used}} as columns, beams and bracing. The rack columns present peculiar features in their design because they have perforations to facilitate assemblage of the system, which makes them more difficult <b>to</b> analyze by <b>cold-formed</b> steel structures design codes. There are several design codes proposed by the manufacturers associations, as the specifications of Rack Manufacturers Institute (RMI), applied in the USA along with the specification of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). These codes propose experimental stub columns tests for the determination of their resistance. In this work, the commercial software, ANSYS, is used for material and geometric nonlinear analysis of these columns, {{and the results are}} compared with experimental data obtained by stub column tests, for a typical section of racks manufactured in Brazil...|$|R
