The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California in November 1991. Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected, [...] "I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady", and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, [...] "There was one sad thing.

500|$|According to Lupton, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] is Angelou's {{most famous}} poem. Lupton {{has argued that}} [...] "Angelou's {{ultimate}} greatness will be attributed" [...] to the poem, and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. British reporter Kate Kellaway compared Angelou's appearance as she read the poem at Clinton's inauguration with the eight-year-old child in Caged Bird, noting that the coats she wore in both occasions were similar: [...] "She looked magnificent, sternly theatrical with an unsmiling bow mouth. She wore a coat with brass buttons, a strange reminder of the eight-year-old Maya Angelou who stood in a courtroom, terrified {{at the sight of the}} man who had raped her". Gillespie stated regarding Kellaway's observations: [...] "But standing tall on the steps of the Capitol, she was light-years removed from that <b>terrible</b> <b>time,</b> and America was no longer an 'unfriendly place.' Her poem 'On the Pulse of Morning' was a soaring call for peace, justice, and harmony. Capturing the hope embodied in the human spirit, it was a solemn and joyful reminder that all things are possible. She wished us 'Good morning' in her poem, and one felt as if a new day was truly dawning." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joe Shishido {{continued}} to work in television and appeared in films for other studios such as the fifth installment of Toei's highly popular post-war yakuza series, [...] (1974). By this time yakuza films had begun to lose favour with the public and Shishido ceased appearing in those types of roles. Over the next 20 years, he focused predominately on television with occasional film appearances including Exchange Students (1982), Bound for the Fields, the Mountains, and the Seacoast (1986) and A Mature Woman (1994). His roles in Kaizo Hayashi's Mike Hama: Private Eye trilogy marked a reemergence of his tough-guy persona.

This was because he had to struggle not to cry when this was being completed, as the scenario was that his character Cornelius was singing to a child who {{was on the verge of}} death. The film was released in cinemas over the summer of 1993. 1993 also saw the release of his special, A Touch of Music In The Night, to coincide with the release of his new album of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} ten, he {{was sent}} off to {{boarding}} school, as was common for boys of his social status. Bowlby’s parents decided to send both him {{and his older brother}} Tony off to the preparatory boarding school in order to protect them from the bombing attacks due to the ongoing war. In his 1973 work Separation: Anxiety and Anger, he revealed that he regarded it as a <b>terrible</b> <b>time</b> for him. He later said, [...] "I wouldn't send a dog away to boarding school at age seven". However, earlier Bowlby had considered boarding schools appropriate for children aged eight and older. In 1951, he wrote: If the child is maladjusted, it may be useful for him to be away for part of the year from the tensions which produced his difficulties, and if the home is bad in other ways the same is true. The boarding school has the advantage of preserving the child's all-important home ties, even if in slightly attenuated form, and, since it forms part of the ordinary social pattern of most Western communities today , the child who goes to boarding-school will not feel different from other children. Moreover, by relieving the parents of the children for part of the year, it will be possible for some of them to develop more favorable attitudes toward their children during the remainder.|$|E

2500|$|Colin McDonald was {{captain of}} Victoria and an {{effective}} opener {{with a short}} backlift who had made centuries against South Africa and the West Indies and had stood up to Tyson in 1954-55. He made as fighting 32 and 89 in , but failed {{in the rest of}} the 1956 series. In 1958-59 McDonald's 519 runs (64.87) made him the first batsmen to top 500 runs in an Ashes series since Len Hutton in 1950-51 and the first Australian to do so since Don Bradman in 1948. His opening partner was Jim Burke a stonewaller who took 578 minutes to make 189 against South Africa in 1957-58 [...] and was the butt of the Sydney Hill barrackers; [...] "Burkey, you're so like a statue, I wish I were a pigeon" [...] He didn't make many runs in 1958-59 though he tended to hang around and retired at the end of the season rather than face the increasingly number of fast bowlers. Neil Harvey was Australia's premier batsmen after the retirement of Don Bradman, a left-handed strokemaker whose technique allowed him to make runs while other could hardly get bat to ball. Norm O'Neill made his debut in this series and was like a breath of fresh air in the stagnant cricket of the late 1950s. Athletic, good-looking and a positive strokemaker he was hailed as the [...] "New Bradman" [...] and a favourite with the crowds. Crowds flocked to his games just to see the [...] "Australian Hope" [...] and his striking 71 not out to win the First Test made a mockery of the England's funeral second innings. After Harvey and O'Neill came Ken Mackay sarcastically called [...] "Slasher Mackay" [...] as he rarely indulged in strokeplay, instead the ungainly Queenslander set about occupying the crease for as long a possible. He never made a Test century and only averaged 33.48, but always seemed to make runs when Australia was in trouble. Les Favell had a <b>terrible</b> <b>time</b> as an opener against Tyson and Statham in 1954-55, but was now a powerful middle-order batsman and crowd favourate who replaced Peter Burge after the First Test. Worth a mention is Bobby Simpson, a batting prodigy to match Norm O'Neill and an outstanding slip fielder, who made a duck in his only Test innings in the series, but was often 12th man and used as a substitute fielder. In the lower order were Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson, both hard-hitting all-rounders who liked to attack the bowling, but whose late order heroics were seldom needed.|$|E
