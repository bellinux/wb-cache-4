40|$|Research {{on group}} {{differences}} in response latency often has as its goal the detection of Group X Treatment interactions. However, accumulating evidence suggests that response latencies for different groups are often linearly related, leading to an increased likelihood of finding spurious overadditive interactions in which the slower group produces a larger treatment effect. The authors propose a rate-amount model that predicts linear relationships between individuals and that includes global processing parameters based on large-scale {{group differences in}} information processing.

40|$|Magnetic depth {{estimation}} methods are routinely used {{to map the}} depth of sedimentary basins by assuming that the sediments are nonmagnetic and underlain by magnetic basement rocks. Most of these methods generate basement depth estimates at discrete points. Converting these depth estimates into a grid or map form often requires the application of qualitative methods. The {{reason for this is}} twofold: first, in deeper parts of basins, there is generally a scarcity of depth estimates and those that have been determined tend to be biased toward the shallower basement structures close to the basin edge; and second, depth estimates intrinsically relate to magnetic anomalies that emanate from the top edges of basement faults/contacts resulting in a shallow depth bias. Thus, simple grid interpolation of these depth estimates often forms a shallower and structurally unrepresentative map when evaluated in detail. To overcome these problems of qualitative and/or simple grid interpolation of these point-depth estimates into a regular grid, we use the pseudogravity field <b>transform</b> <b>response</b> of the magnetic field to constrain this interpolation using inversion methods together with the relationship between the point-depth estimates and their pseudogravity values. The pseudogravity transformation converts a grid of magnetic data such that the resulting grid has the same simple relationship to magnetic susceptibility that a gravity grid has to density. The pseudogravity map is thus straightforward to visualize in terms of basement structure, but it only maps the magnetic properties of the subsurface and is not related to the gravity anomaly or the density. We describe a practical approach to invert pseudogravity grids using gravity inversion software to produce a 3 D basin model assuming a constant susceptibility basement. The approach is initially tested on the Bishop 3 D model and then applied to an example from the northern North Sea. This approach can be considered complementary to 3 D gravity inversion and has the advantage that the pseudogravity response is not affected by structure within the sediments or effects such as sediment compaction, inversion, or isostatic compensation, all of which often complicate the gravity response of sedimentary basins...|$|E

The classic estimates of the parameter defining the transformation {{as well as of}} the regression coefficients are based on the maximum likelihood criterion, assuming homoscedastic normal errors for the <b>transformed</b> <b>response.</b> These estimates are nonrobust in the presence of outliers and can be inconsistent when the errors are nonnormal or heteroscedastic. This article proposes new robust estimates that are consistent and asymptotically normal for any unimodal and homoscedastic error distribution. For this purpose, a robust version of conditional expectation is introduced for which the prediction mean squared error is replaced with an M scale. This concept is then used to develop a nonparametric criterion to estimate the transformation parameter as well as the regression coefficients. A finite sample estimate of this criterion based on a robust version of smearing is also proposed.
