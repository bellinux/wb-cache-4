5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> of state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} how reimbursement cost-effectiveness thresholds, per unit of <b>health</b> <b>benefit,</b> whether set explicitly or observed implicitly via historical reimbursement decisions, serve as a signal to firms about the commercial viability of their R&D projects (including candidate products for in-licensing). Traditional finance methods for R&D project valuations, such as net present value analyses (NPV), incorporate information from these payer reimbursement signals to help determine which R&D projects should be continued and which projects should be terminated (in {{the case of the}} latter because they yield an NPV < 0). Because the influence these signals have for firm R&D investment decisions is so significant, we argue it is important that reimbursement thresholds reflect the economic value of <b>the</b> unit of <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> being considered for reimbursement. Thresholds set too low (below the economic value of <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefit)</b> will result in R&D investment levels that too low relative to the economic value of R&D (on the margin). Similarly, thresholds set too high (above the economic value of <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefit)</b> will result in inefficiently high levels of R&D spending. The U. S. in particular...|$|R
40|$|For a {{large number}} of {{infectious}} diseases, vaccination is {{the most effective way to}} prevent an epidemic. However, the vaccine stockpile is hardly ever sufficient to treat the entire population, which brings about the challenge of vaccine allocation. To aid decision makers facing this challenge, we provide insights into the structure of this problem. We first investigate <b>the</b> dependence of <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> on <b>the</b> fraction of people that receive vaccination, where we define <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> as <b>the</b> total number of people that escape infection. We start with the seminal SIR compartmental model. Using implicit function analysis, we prove the existence of a unique vaccination fraction that maxi- mizes <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> per dose of vaccine, and that <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> per dose of vaccine decreases monotonically when moving away from this fraction in either direc- tion. Surprisingly, this fraction does not coincide with the so-called critical vaccination coverage that has been advocated in literature. We extend these insights to other compartmental models such as the SEIR model. These results allow us to provide new insights into vaccine allocation to multiple non-interacting or weakly interacting populations. We explain the counter-intuitive switching behavior of optimal allocation. We show that allocations that maximize <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> are rarely equitable, while equitable allocations may be significantly non-optimal...|$|R

25|$|In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's {{phenolic}} content {{falls under}} the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the astringency, color and mouthfeel of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins that they receive during winemaking.
