40|$|At {{the close}} of the 1996 - 97 {{academic}} year, some 45, 000 transfer-oriented students left the Washington community and technical colleges they had been attending. Eleven thousand, three hundred of these students transferred immediately to a four-year institution in Washington or Oregon, with another 2, 000 transferring a year later. More than half of the students did not transfer but either stayed in the job held during college or gained employment after college. The employment status of these non-transferring students is described in this report. All of the former students described here reported that their purpose for attending was to prepare for transfer, but they also encompass people who plan to work for several years before actually transferring. Given the diversity of purposes masked in the simple <b>transfer</b> <b>declaration,</b> knowing about how the college experience impacts the quality of employment of these former transfer-oriented students is important. Some key findings are: quality employment is a key outcome for those enrolled with a declared transfer purpose; the more education gained at community and technical colleges, the greater the economic outcomes for these non-transferring students; and non-transferring students had substantial labor force attachment before and during college as well as after college.

40|$|AbstractInternational {{literature}} {{indicates a}} decrease in participation (Schulz & Sibberns, 2004; Birzea et al., 2005) in western societies where legal frameworks are challenged by sociopolitical and cultural changes like migration, neoliberalism and globalization (Benhabib, 2002). These changes also affect the identity construction processes of new generations, as participation, belonging, and citizenship are rooted in identity formation (Bell, 1999) and instituted through family and school. In contemporary democratic societies schools must offer {{a new model of}} citizenship with multiple possible memberships. “Whilst every individual, to a certain extent, is a product of his or her heritage and social background, in contemporary modern democracies everyone can enrich his or her own identity by integrating different cultural affiliations” (Council of Europe, 2008, 18). This paper presents exploratory research conducted to verify if and how teachers and institutions engage in education for democratic citizenship from an intercultural perspective. We conducted qualitative conversational interviews with 47 teachers (8 preschool, 16 primary, 15 middle school and 8 secondary). Open-ended questions on their missions and what they do in class to promote citizenship education were employed to understand their beliefs about citizenship education and their practices to promote a democratic intercultural habitus among students. Some teachers had ambiguous or assimilationist conceptions of citizenship education, and others based it on ethics and interculturalism for an inclusive concept of citizenship. Teachers’ descriptions of practical actions fell into seven major categories: belonging, recognizing differences, listening to others, managing conflicts, participation, making rules together, and building communities. Some of their good practices are not yet instilled institutionally, so teachers trying to foster a democratic habitus feel isolated within their institutions and wider society. <b>Transferring</b> universal <b>declarations</b> and ethics into daily practice cannot be done by teachers alone, but requires the examples and actions of adults in society at large. Also, teachers need specific training interventions to orient this work...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. Chapter 1 Introduction In {{his budget}} speech of 23 February 2000 the {{minister}} of finance Mr Trevor Manuel announced the introduction of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in South Africa. Internationally, the idea of such tax is uncommon, with many ofour trading partners having implemented CGT decades ago. In order to give effect on the proposal relating to CGT, an Eighth Schedule {{has been added to}} the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The Eighth Schedule determines a taxable gain or loss and a new section 26 A of the principal Act provides that the taxable gain is included in taxable income. The date from which capital gains tax started was 1 October 2001. Chapter 2 The transfer ofprimary residence from private individuals The Department of Inland Revenue makes a distinction between what it calls Property Investors and Property Traders. This is a very important distinction; A Property Investor will be liable to pay Income Tax, on rental income and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on profits made when selling the property in the normal way, however, a Property Dealer (also known as a trader) will find that all his or her profits made on the sale of a property are taxed as Income Tax and not taxed as Capital Gains. So, the key to deciding your tax minimising strategy is figure out whether you will be treated as a dealer or an investor. The Eighth Schedule to th~ Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 provides that only natural persons (individuals) are entitled to exclude the first R 1 million of gains on disposal of their primary residences. Chapter 3 & 4 The transfer of primary residence from Trusts, Companies and Close Corporations Many individuals have historically purchased their residence in companies for a variety of reasons, including protection from creditors, avoidance of transfer duty and estate duty and circumvention of the repealed Group Areas Act. These persons now face a potential Capital Gains Tax (CGT) liability when their company, close corporation or trust disposes of the residence. ~ The Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 2004 provides that only natural persons (individuals) and special trusts are entitled to exclude the first R 1 million of gains on disposal of their primary residence. This exclusion does not apply where a company, close corporation or trust owns the residence. Chapter 5 Transfer Duty A system whereby conveyancers will be able to lodge <b>transfer</b> duty <b>declarations</b> and make payments electronically via the internet will become operational during April 2005. Conveyancers will be ab, le to lodge the declarations by transferors (sellers) and transferees (purchasers) to SARS branches electronically and simultaneously make payments to designated SARS bank accounts. SARS will verify the duty calculations and authorizes the issue of a transfer duty receipt. Conveyancers wishing to make use of ev filing should register as e-filers by visiting the e-Commerce section of the SARS website. Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendation...|$|R
