25|$|Beginning in July 1974, Kallinger and his 15-year-old son Michael {{went on a}} crime spree {{spanning}} Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Jersey. Over {{the next}} six weeks, they robbed, assaulted, and sexually abused four families and murdered three people, gaining entrance to each house by pretending to be salesmen. On January 8, 1975, they continued their spree in Leonia, New Jersey. Using a pistol and a knife, they overpowered and tied up the three residents. Then, when others entered the home, {{they were forced to}} strip and bound with cords from lamps and other appliances. This culminated in the killing of 21-year-old nurse Maria Fasching, the eighth person to arrive, when she reprimanded Kallinger and he responded by slitting her throat. Finally, another of the residents, still bound, managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> and cry for help. Neighbors saw her and called the police, but by the time they arrived the Kallingers had fled, using the city bus as their getaway vehicle and dumping their weapons and a bloody shirt along the way.|$|E
500|$|For the film, Hughes got {{the chance}} to take a more {{expansive}} look at the city he grew up in. [...] "We took a helicopter up the Chicago River. This is the first chance I'd really had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> while making a movie. Up to this point, the pictures had been pretty small. I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could, not just the architecture and the landscape, but the spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|Production {{began in}} February 2007 in South Africa, where the {{majority}} of filming took place. South Africa was chosen as a primary filming location for economic reasons, costing a third of estimated production in the United Kingdom. Shooting in South Africa lasted 56 days out of 66 days, with the remaining ten taking place in Scotland. Marshall said of South Africa's appeal, [...] "The landscape, the rock formations, I thought it was about as close to Scotland as you're likely <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> <b>outside</b> of Ireland or Wales." [...] In Scotland, secondary filming took place in the city of Glasgow, including Haghill in the city's East End, and at Blackness Castle in West Lothian, the latter chosen when filmmakers were unable to shoot at Doune Castle. The entire shoot, involving thousands of extras, included a series of complex fight scenes and pyrotechnical displays. The director sought to minimise the use of computer-generated elements in Doomsday, preferring to subscribe to [...] "old-school filmmaking". In the course of production, several sequences were dropped due to budgetary concerns, including a scene in which helicopter gunships attacked a medieval castle.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with People, Selleck talked about {{living and working}} on his farm: [...] "So I like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> {{and work on the}} farm, from fixing roads to clearing brush. I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike staring at my navel. And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it." [...] Selleck has also stated he dislikes avocados.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar ben Perata {{taught that}} manna counteracted the ill effects of foreign foods on the Israelites. But the Gemara taught after the Israelites {{complained about the}} manna in [...] God {{burdened}} the Israelites with the walk of three parasangs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> their camp to answer the call of nature. And {{it was then that}} the command of [...] “And you shall have a paddle among your weapons,” began to apply to the Israelites.|$|E
2500|$|Swami Vivekananda {{compared}} {{human mind}} with a monkey {{who is always}} restless and incessantly active by his own nature. He noticed, the human mind naturally wants <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside,</b> to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs. So, he stressed on practice of concentration, as he felt there is no limit {{to the power of}} the human mind, the more concentrated it is, the more powerful it becomes. [...] Swami Vivekananda suggested not to do anything which disturbs the mind or makes it restless.|$|E
50|$|During {{training}} camp {{heading into the}} 2011 season, Cushing {{was told that he}} would be switching from outside to inside linebacker due to the new 3-4 defense.

60|$|At {{last the}} crowd at the doorway thinned out, and a moment later the four Rovers, pushing the girls ahead of them, managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside.</b> They found {{themselves}} in a narrow alleyway, and from this hurried to the street beyond.|$|E

5000|$|In 1980 Ravard {{established}} the [...] "Telephone Music" [...] a publishing company.

6000|$|... "It {{shows that}} earnestness and effort can very easily {{overtake}} and pass mere training and technical skill. The {{object of the}} Ober-Ammergau 'super' is, not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> and have a drink, but to help forward {{the success of the}} drama.|$|E
60|$|They had a {{clear view}} of the dark hull and towering canvas of the barque as she swept along in front of them, {{intending}} evidently to take advantage of the wind in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> the Goodwins before beating up Channel.|$|E
60|$|Victoria was of two minds {{whether to}} accept this invitation.

60|$|The Aurora was {{the first}} {{steamboat}} {{of the year for}} the Outside, and her decks were jammed with prosperous adventurers and broken gold seekers, all equally as mad <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Outside</b> as they had been originally <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Inside. Near the gang-plank, Scott was shaking hands with Matt, who was preparing to go ashore. But Matt's hand went limp in the other's grasp as his gaze shot past and remained fixed on something behind him. Scott turned to see. Sitting on the deck several feet away and watching wistfully was White Fang.|$|R

5000|$|Turning (or {{turning the}} circle), is the {{practice}} many people associate with Baguazhang. [...] "Yin style Bagua {{is the art}} of striking while you are moving. You ceaselessly move and strike, and are always trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the <b>outside</b> your opponent by turning. No matter what, position yourself to avoid the heavy blows and let the light ones fall. It is within turning that these movements and techniques are honed to perfection or to a higher level.

60|$|There is {{only one}} {{pleasure}} higher than that, and that is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> and break the vow.

60|$|The {{question}} agitating {{the majority}} of the congregation during the singing of the hymn was the time it would take them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> the church. There still remained a faint hope that the Rev.

50|$|In a move {{strongly}} {{opposed by the}} Church of Greece, Papandreou introduced, {{for the first time}} in Greece, the process of civil marriage. Prior to the institution of civil marriages in Greece, the only legally recognized marriages were those conducted in the Church of Greece. Couples seeking a civil marriage had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married <b>outside</b> Greece, generally in Italy. Under PASOK, the Greek State also appropriated real estate properties previously owned by the Church.|$|R

Waal, sir, as we're bound on {{the same sort of}} v'y'ge, I'm happy to have fallen in with you; and I see no reason why we should not be neighbourly, and 'gam' it a little, when we've nothing better to do.

A pipeline was also built to pump thousands of tourists each year into West Wales, but the casualties from its first run meant that it was soon replaced by an A-Road.|$|R
