50|$|In {{the whole}} of Turkey there are about 11,000 species of {{flowering}} plant, {{about a third of}} which are endemic to the country.

The flora of the European part of Turkey is similar to that of adjoining Greece. The ecoregions here include Balkan mixed forests dominated by oaks and containing Scots pine, Bosnian pine, Macedonian pine, silver fir and Norway spruce, and Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests where some of the main species are oaks, <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree,</b> Greek <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree,</b> Spanish broom and laurel.|$|R

The data obtained show that despite the existence of a good correlation level between the markers, none of them at the moment can be proposed as a marker of purity of this honey, due to very complex interactions between contamination by foreign nectars in <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> honey and spatial (geographical origin of the samples) and temporal (year and flowering period) parameters.
