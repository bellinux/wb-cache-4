2500|$|Scarborough {{was one of}} a {{group of}} about 40 freshmen Republican legislators who dubbed {{themselves}} the [...] "New Federalists" [...] after The Federalist Papers. [...] Scarborough was elected Political Director of the incoming legislators. The New Federalists called for sweeping cuts in the U.S. government, including plans to [...] "privatize, localize, consolidate, [...] eliminate" [...] the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy and Housing and Urban Development. [...] Gingrich tapped Scarborough to head a Republican task force on education, and Scarborough declared, [...] "Our goal is to get as much money, power and authority out of Washington and get as much money, power and authority into the classroom as possible." [...] Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), then Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Committee,</b> adopted Scarborough's language eliminating the federal Department of Education in the 1996 House Budget Resolution. The budget passed the House by a vote of 238–193.|$|E
2500|$|During Wolfowitz's pre-war {{testimony}} before Congress, he dismissed General Eric K. Shinseki's {{estimates of the}} size of the post war occupation force which would be needed. General Shinseki testified to the US Senate Armed Services Committee on February 25, 2003 that [...] "something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers" [...] would probably be required for postwar Iraq. [...] By contrast, Wolfowitz estimated that fewer than 100,000 troops would be necessary in Iraq. Two days after Shinseki testified, Wolfowitz said to <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Committee</b> on February 27, 2003:There has been a good deal of comment—some of it quite outlandish—about what our postwar requirements might be in Iraq. Some of the higher end predictions we have been hearing recently, such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq, are wildly off the mark. It is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of Saddam's security forces and his army—hard to imagine.|$|E
2500|$|The gay {{and lesbian}} rights {{movement}} in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. Leonard Matlovich appeared {{on the cover of}} Time in 1975. In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, [...] "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." [...] It cited the military's need [...] "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" [...] and [...] "to prevent breaches of security". In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' Parris Island Depot, activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate {{for an end to the}} exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces. In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of Joseph Steffan's lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that [...] "having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed." [...] Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracey Thorne and Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator Brock Adams (D-Washington) and Rep. Barbara Boxer introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year. In July 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in the context of the outing of his press aide Pete Williams, dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as [...] "a bit of an old chestnut" [...] in testimony before <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Committee.</b> In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and the Detroit Free Press. In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report that members of Congress had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban on gays and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.|$|E
