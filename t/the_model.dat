In 1996, Dugan produced <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> D-1, an automixer for speech-only applications. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> D-2 returned to having applicability for both speech and music, as did <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> D-3. In 1997, Dugan licensed his system to Protech Audio of Indian Lake, New York, yielding the Protech 2000 model series.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, known as <b>the</b> <b>model,</b> to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it}} were distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> and the abundance of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> in the geographical area. The more toxic <b>the</b> <b>model</b> is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When <b>the</b> <b>model</b> is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from <b>the</b> <b>model</b> are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where <b>the</b> <b>model</b> is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are <b>the</b> <b>model</b> species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> E, the E {{standing for}} economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller {{and less expensive}} than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E

30|$|The present {{assessment}} {{has several}} uncertainties {{that influence the}} calculations. These uncertainties originate from the incalculable small-scale environmental conditions and also from <b>the</b> climate <b>models.</b> <b>The</b> uncertainty of the climate projection is caused by many factors.

However, <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> social and economic changes in the future (the anthropogenic climate forcing factor in <b>the</b> <b>models)</b> is <b>the</b> most difficult and therefore the most uncertain part of <b>the</b> <b>models.</b> <b>The</b> uncertainty of <b>the</b> climate <b>model</b> simulation results can hardly decrease {{due to the lack}} of validation of <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> data (Bartholy et al. 2008).|$|R

5|$|The Duesenberg Model A was {{the first}} {{automobile}} in series production to have hydraulic brakes and the first automobile in series production in the United States with a straight-eight engine.
