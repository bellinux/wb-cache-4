25|$|The ruble is the {{currency}} of Transnistria and is divided into 100 kopecks. Since Transnistria is a state with limited international recognition and considered as part of Moldova, its currency has no ISO 4217 code. However, unofficially some Transnistrian organisations such as Agroprombank and Gazprombank used the code PRB, a code {{that would otherwise be}} reserved for Puerto Rico (ISO 3166-1 country code PR).

25|$|Soviet {{banknotes}} {{were used}} in the <b>Trans-Dniester</b> Moldavian Republic after its formation in 1990. When the former Soviet republics began issuing their own currencies, Transnistria was flooded with Soviet rubles. In an attempt to protect its financial system, in July 1993 the Transnistrian government bought used Goznak-printed Soviet and Russian notes dated 1961–1992 which it modified by applying adhesive stamps bearing the image of General Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov, founder of Tiraspol and its corresponding denomination. These stamped notes replaced unstamped Soviet and Russian notes at par. It is thought that most uncirculated notes bearing these stickers were created after 1994 specifically for collectors.|$|E
25|$|Transnistria is {{the region}} {{east of the}} Dniester River, which {{includes}} {{a large proportion of}} predominantly Russophone ethnic Russians and Ukrainians (51%, as of 1989, with ethnic Moldovans forming a 40% minority). The headquarters of the Soviet 14th Guards Army was located in the regional capital Tiraspol. There, on September 2, 1990, local authorities proclaimed an independent Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The motives behind this move were fear of the rise of nationalism in Moldova and the country's expected reunification with Romania upon secession from the USSR. In the winter of 1991–1992 clashes occurred between Transnistrian forces and the Moldovan police. Between March 2 and July 26, 1992, the conflict escalated into a military engagement. Following an intervention of the 14th Army into the conflict {{on the side of the}} separatists, the war was stopped and the Moscow Agreement on the principles of peace settlement of armed conflict in <b>Trans-Dniester</b> districts of the republic of Moldova was signed on 21 July 1992.|$|E

40|$|The {{delegation}} of the European Union to Moldova takes upon itself {{the task of}} {{making the case for}} the Association Agenda between the country and the EU. The European foreign policy in the borderlands of the Union is carried out against the background of the war in Eastern Ukraine. A war of words is being fought in Moldovan media as well. Mostly on Romanian-speaking TV, Pirkka Tapiola, the EU ambassador, is among those who lead the way. At a time of renewed Western concern about Eastern Europe, the media presence of the EU in Moldova reveals anxieties about the future: once again, the former Soviet republic seems to be teetering on the brink of Russian control. The breakaway region of <b>Trans-Dniester</b> and the prospect of default are the two main concerns that the EU mission has to address while speaking the language of European politics in a country battered by corruption, high inflation, and unemployment. The discourse of Pirkka Tapiola, Head of the EU delegation, is an exercise in spokesmanship, which seems to underplay the seriousness of the situation. According to opinion polls conducted recently, the avowedly pro-Russian parties would win the next election. In hindsight, it is possible to surmise that the pro-EU parties pulled off a political coup by deferring the costs incurred during the mandates of the previous government coalitions. Parties whose constituencies are declining stayed in power, while better alternatives have developed: the new names that {{can be found on the}} right wing of the Moldovan political spectrum show that their electorate is ready to embrace the goal of European accession once again...|$|E
