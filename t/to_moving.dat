5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure game, requiring the player {{to move and}} guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player characters in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited <b>to</b> <b>moving</b> only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior <b>to</b> <b>moving</b> to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E

Texas Governor Rick Perry, prepared state resources for the potentially impacted areas, including the deployment of 200 Texas Military Forces soldiers and six Black Hawk helicopters and two water rescue teams for search and rescue missions. The Texas State Operations Center was activated shortly after the cyclone developed.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>moving</b> a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E
