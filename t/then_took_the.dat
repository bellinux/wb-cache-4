On November 8, 1994, Último Dragón won the {{championship}} and for the next 10 years the title was promoted primarily in Japan. On September 3, 2004, Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant championship, bringing it back under CMLL's control.|$|E
5|$|The third match saw Big Show face Snitsky. The match {{began with}} Big Show and Snitsky brawling as the bell rang. Big Show {{was able to}} perform a big slap to the chest and headbutt. Snitsky <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> upper hand over Big Show, as he applied an armbar hold, after {{countering}} a chokeslam. Big Show delivered a Spinebuster and got the victory after a successful chokeslam.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 through 2002, Banister {{worked as}} Pittsburgh's Major League Field Coordinator on the {{coaching}} staffs of managers Gene Lamont and Lloyd McClendon. He was then assigned {{the job of}} Minor League Field Coordinator, and served in that role from 2003 through 2010. In 2004, he served as the interim manager of Lynchburg when Jay Loviglio resigned from the position due to personal reasons. Banister became the interim pitching coach for Lynchburg in 2008 when Bob Milacki resigned from the position. Mike Steele <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> job from Banister in 2009. Banister managed the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL) in 2009.|$|E

He <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> offensive to the heartland of Persia, and arrived at the walls of its capital Ctesiphon. The city withstood the short siege but Odaenathus reclaimed the entirety of Roman lands occupied by the Persians {{since the beginning of}} their invasions in 252. Odaenathus celebrated his victories and declared himself King of Kings, crowning his son Hairan I as co-king. By 263, Odaenathus was in effective control of the Levant, Mesopotamia and Anatolia's eastern region.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} non-conference game the 2013 season, Alabama shutout the Chattanooga Mocs of the Southern Conference 49–0 on senior day at Bryant–Denny Stadium. After the Alabama defense forced a Mocs three-and-out {{on the first}} {{possession}} of the game, Christion Jones fumbled the punt that ensued with Sema'je Kendall for Chattanooga making the recovery at the Alabama 34-yard line. The Alabama defense once again held strong and Trey DePriest ended the possession with his interception at the 17-yard line on fourth down. The Crimson Tide offense <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> ball 83-yards on its first possession with Kenyan Drake making the score 7–0 on his 13-yard touchdown run.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. R.F. Herrick bought Kinman's {{traveling}} museum {{collection of}} 186 items, {{including at least}} two of his famous chairs, and displayed them in San Francisco in 1893. She <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> collection to Chicago to display them at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where she reportedly sold the individual items. The Clarke Historical Museum in Eureka displays a suit of his buckskins, complete with beaded moccasins, as well as a wooden chest he owned. The Ferndale Museum displays several Kinman items, including another of his buckskin suits.|$|E

5|$|The season did {{not start}} well when Hill spun out of second place shortly {{after the start of}} the South African Grand Prix and failed to finish the race after colliding with Alex Zanardi on lap 16. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Hill {{qualified}} and spent {{the early stages of the}} race running second behind Prost, and <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lead when Prost crashed out, but was relegated back to second by another triple world champion, Ayrton Senna. Nevertheless, the race still gave Hill his first podium finish.|$|E
5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to disembark {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E
5|$|After three {{consecutive}} three-day matches, which involved playing in nine {{days out of}} ten, Miller sat out the next match against Surrey at The Oval, which Australia won by an innings. He returned to take seven wickets in the next fixture against Cambridge University. In the first innings, he resumed his battle with John Dewes, whom he had troubled during the Victory Tests in 1945. This time, Dewes put a thick towel under his shirt for protection against an anticipated short-pitched barrage; instead, Miller followed a short ball with a yorker to dismiss him. He <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> last three wickets to end with 5/46 as the hosts were bowled out for 167 in the first innings. Miller was not required to bat as Australia amassed 4/414 declared then took 2/29 as his team completed an innings victory.|$|E

5|$|By 1913 Silvester was {{suffering}} from continual poor health. He resigned his position at the tabernacle on medical advice in January 1914, and intended to resign his parliamentary seat. On a speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at Yale University, and <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> ferry to Toronto; as it entered the harbour, he collapsed and died, aged 49; Horne was aged seven at the time. From September that year Horne attended St George's School, Harpenden as a boarder—the seventh of the Horne children to attend the school. Although he was not strong academically, he developed into a good sportsman, representing the school in rugby and cricket, and during the summer holidays {{took part in the}} Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at Queen's Club; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future Wimbledon finalist Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|Celtic manager Jock Stein {{was then}} {{appointed}} manager of Scotland on a part-time basis. Stein {{took charge of}} their attempt {{to qualify for the}} 1966 World Cup. Scotland achieved good results in their first two qualifiers, a draw against Poland and a win against Finland. Stein was criticised by the Scottish press after the team conceded two late goals and lost 2–1 at home to Poland, but they managed to beat Italy 1–0 at Hampden Park to raise some hope of qualification. Scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from the return match against Italy due to injury and a 3–0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify. Clyde manager John Prentice <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> job on a full-time basis in 1966, but left to manage Dundee after just six months and four games in charge.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

5|$|Helmut Paul Emil Wick {{was born}} on 5 August 1915 in Mannheim, Germany, the {{youngest}} of three children of a civil engineer, Karl Wick and Berta Wick, née Schenck. Helmut's eldest brother Walter was born in Swakopmund, {{at the time in}} the German protectorate in South-West Africa. The outbreak of World War I forced the family to return to Germany and Helmut's sister, Doris, was born in Rohrbach, near Heidelberg. Owing to the demand for his father's skills and expertise building roads and bridges, Helmut spent most of his childhood traveling throughout the German Empire. The Wick family moved to Hanover in 1919; Helmut's mother died there in February 1922. His father <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> family to Oliva, near Danzig and Königsberg in East Prussia, finally settling in Berlin in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Rashad Carmichael intercepted a pass by Jonathan Crompton {{leading to a}} Williams third-down run from the 1 to give the Hokies a 7-0 lead. Williams scored again, this time from the 3, to push the lead to 14-0 in the second quarter. Tennessee <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> momentum. Montario Hardesty ran through 301-pound {{defensive}} tackle Cordarrow Thompson’s tackle for a 4-yard run to cap an 80-yard drive. Janzen Jackson’s interception set up Crompton’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Moore with 18 seconds remaining in the first half. Instead of running out the clock, Taylor threw from his 33 to Jarrett Boykin, who was stopped inside the Volunteers’ 5 as the clock apparently expired. Tennessee players left the field but were summoned back and reluctantly returned as a video review showed that Boykin’s knee hit the ground with 2 seconds remaining. Matt Waldron kicked a 21-yard field goal as the first half ran out to give Virginia Tech a 17-14 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened and shook his head.|$|E

5|$|Michigan scored 28 {{unanswered}} {{points to}} erase a ten-point deficit and defeat Northwestern 42–24. Michigan scored first on a nine-yard reception by Steve Watsdon. Northwestern {{replied with a}} 15-yard touchdown run by Kain Colter, and <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lead on a seven-yard run by Treyvon Green. In the second quarter, Michigan's Jeremy Gallon caught a 25-yard touchdown reception. The Wildcats responded with a two-yard touchdown run by Adonis Smith, and scored their final points of {{the game with a}} 20-yard field goal by Jeff Budzien. Michigan dominated the second half with four unanswered touchdowns. In the third quarter, Denard Robinson scored on a two-yard run, then Devin Gardner scored on a one-yard run. In the fourth quarter, Michael Shaw scored on a two-yard run, and Denard Robinson capped the victory with a five-yard run.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He <b>then</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
