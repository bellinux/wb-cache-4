We find that geographic <b>targeting</b> dominates demographic <b>targeting</b> (based on linking transfer levels to demographic composition), which in turn dominates household proxy-means <b>targeting.</b> However, the contribution of proxy-means <b>targeting</b> increases substantially as the program expands into less marginal localities.

5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking <b>targets</b> along the coast and further inland.

These assets also attacked North Korean convoys and troop movements along the roads to great effect. During these attacks North Korean aircraft rarely opposed the US aircraft, but in a few occasions Yak-9 flights appeared, and in one instance engaged a flight of F-80s from the 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, allowing Lieutenants Charles A.

5|$|Five major {{precision}} bombing {{attacks were}} conducted {{as part of}} the Empire Plan. On 9June, two groups of B-29s bombed an aircraft factory at Narao and another two groups raided a factory in Atsuta; both facilities were badly damaged. A single group of Superfortresses also attempted to bomb a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory at Akashi but accidentally struck a nearby village instead. The next day, XXIBomber Command bombers escorted by 107 P-51s successfully attacked six different factories in the Tokyo Bay region. Precision bombing raids were also conducted on 22June, when 382 B-29s attacked six <b>targets</b> at Kure, Kakamigahara, Himeji, Mizushima and Akashi in southern Honshu. Most of the factories targeted were badly damaged. Four days later, 510 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were sent against nine factories in southern Honshu and Shikoku. Heavy clouds over the region meant that many bombers attacked <b>targets</b> of opportunity individually or in small groups, and little damage was done to the raid's intended <b>targets.</b> Cloudy weather prevented any further large-scale precision attacks until 24July, when 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven <b>targets</b> near Nagoya and Osaka. Four of the factories attacked suffered heavy damage. Renewed cloudy weather prevented any further Empire Plan precision attacks in the last weeks of the war.|$|E

50|$|A zero-acquaintance {{situation}} {{requires a}} perceiver {{to make a}} judgment about a <b>target</b> with whom the perceiver has had no prior interactions. These judgments can be made using a variety of cues, including brief interactions with the <b>target,</b> video recordings of the <b>target,</b> photographs of the <b>target,</b> and observations of the <b>target's</b> personal environments, among others. In zero-acquaintance studies, the <b>target's</b> actual personality is determined through the <b>target's</b> self-rating and/or ratings from close acquaintance(s) of that <b>target.</b> Consensus in ratings is determined by how consistently perceivers rate the <b>target's</b> personality when compared to other raters. Accuracy in ratings is determined by how well perceivers' ratings of a <b>target</b> compare to that <b>target's</b> self-ratings on the same scale, or to that <b>target's</b> close acquaintances' ratings of the <b>target.</b> Zero-acquaintance judgments are regularly made in day-to-day life. Given that these judgments tend to remain stable, even as the length of interaction increases, they can influence important interpersonal outcomes.|$|R
