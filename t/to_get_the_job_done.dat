25|$|The Wildcats cruised {{to their}} 11th Grand Final {{appearance}} with a 2–0 Semi Final series {{win over the}} Wollongong Hawks. After knocking out the Hawks in straight sets, the Wildcats faced historical rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the 2014 Grand Final. After winning Game 1 in Perth {{on the back of}} a 30-point effort from James Ennis, the team headed to Adelaide looking <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done</b> in two. But it wasn't to be, as the 36ers forced a deciding third game with an 89–84 win in Game 2. Returning to Perth Arena less than 48 hours later for Game 3, the Wildcats crushed the 36ers with a 93–59 win in front of 13,498 fans, as their 2–1 series victory saw them claim their sixth NBL Championship. Jermaine Beal was subsequently named the series MVP after Ennis struggled to make an impact in Games 2 and 3. Beal averaged 17.6 points per game during the Grand Final series, hitting 11 three-pointers at an efficient 48%.|$|E
25|$|Troy Percival was {{activated}} {{from the}} disabled list on September 2. In Toronto for his second outing since his return, he allowed a walk-off grand slam with two outs when the Rays were ahead by a single run and in position {{to win the game}} in extra innings. Against Boston during another extra inning game, Percival came in to close with a three-run lead and allowed the first three batters to reach base. He was removed from the game in favor of Jason Hammel, who had never recorded a save at the MLB level, and was the only remaining reliever available for the Rays in the game due to its length. Hammel converted the save opportunity, but many questioned if Percival should remain as the team's closer. The reason for Percival's removal from the game against Boston was a stiff back, and not for the game's situation, or for any sort of leg injury that had plagued him throughout the year. Percival stated that because of warming up multiple times throughout the game, only to not come in until the Rays took a lead, was what pained his back. Percival acknowledged that he knew he didn't feel well, and that he should have called for his own removal, but decided that with the lead the Rays had, he would be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> As a result of the game, the Rays decided to not use Percival too often on consecutive nights, and using him in a tie game if the situation of the game changes while he is warming up. He would still be listed as the team's closer.|$|E

[...] One of Johns' most important decisions involved {{the construction of a}} new deep-water berth for Liberty ships at Tatana Island. This involved building a causeway out to the island. The project would double the capacity of the port of Port Moresby, but in order to build it Johns had to divert the African-American 96th Engineers from work on the airfields around Port Moresby, raising fears from airmen like Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead that the airfields would not be ready for all-weather operations by the time that the rainy season arrived. Rains in late October did indeed close three airfields but the causeway opened on 30 October and the wharf accepted its first ship on 3 November.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, {{winter was}} {{threatening}} {{and in order}} for the walls of the new church to be protected from potential damage, the roof had to be laid before any snow began to fall. This meant that more workers were needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>done</b> faster. This was a problem because the church's account did not contain enough money to employ more men. As soon as the committee of 100 became aware of this, they began asking for help. They found 30 parishioners who were each willing to lend another $500 each. These parishioners had already given high contributions to the new church but were still willing to help. As a result, the church had an extra $15,000 to pay for the construction of the roof. Every day for about two months, over fifty parishioners worked on building the church roof. In December 1941, the roof was completed. [...] One of the men who helped complete the roof read about the attack on Pearl Harbor in the newspapers and decided to quit his work on the church and enlist in the United States Air Force.

2500|$|A {{deal was}} {{proposed}} that if Luang Por Dhammajayo surrender {{he would not}} be incarcerated and subsequently defrocked. Although the DSI agreed with such a guarantee at first, they later stated they could not give it because it was the jurisdiction of the court to decide on this. News analysts speculated that Thai law enforcement {{had not been able to}} arrest the abbot successfully, because of the complexity of the temple's terrains, the flexibility and amount of practitioners, and the imminent danger of a violent clash. Another reason brought up by news analysts was the Thai junta's concern for potential international backlash that could be generated from Wat Phra Dhammakaya's numerous international centers. In fact, international followers had already petitioned the White House and met with US Congressmen regarding the case. During the standoff, temple officials still affirmed that they were willing to cooperate with law enforcement, their only request being that the DSI give Luang Por Dhammajayo his charges at the temple due to his health. However, the police applied the method of [...] "trimming the tree" [...] by issuing hundreds of fines about gates, bridges, and other parts of the temple, to gradually get more control over the temple.

The court nobles were very pleased to see his arrival, and had great hopes for him as an agent of the kōbu-gattai (...) movement to promote renewed cooperation between the Court and the Shogunate. [...] In order to achieve the objectives that the Shugoshoku position entailed, Katamori made use of city patrol units, some of them made up of his own retainers, but others consisting of hired, previously lordless men, such as the Shinsengumi. Other groups emerged in subsequent years, including the Mimawarigumi, which was {{under the control of the}} Shoshidai (which as of 1864 was Katamori's brother Matsudaira Sadaaki of Kuwana). Katamori took his role as protector of Kyoto (and the Court) very seriously, and thus played a large role in the coup d'état of September 30 (or the coup d'état of August 18), and the Forbidden Gates Incident ( [...] , Kinmon no Hen), which both involved clashes between the allied domainal forces under Shogunate command (including Aizu han) against the men of Chōshū han.
