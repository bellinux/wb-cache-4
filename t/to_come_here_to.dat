He stated [...] "I had to sacrifice some things but I'm here {{to play football}} again and I'm here to prove a point. I'm {{very happy to be}} here, it's a great club – and I'm sure I'll do well here." [...] West Ham chairman David Sullivan announced that in order for Mido to secure his long-term footballing future, his contract with West Ham put him amongst the lowest earners in the Premier League. Sullivan said [...] "He doesn't want to be known as a 'has been' of English football, so he was willing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> play for a nominal fee, just £1,000 a week." [...] He made his debut for West Ham on 6 February in 2–1 away defeat against Burnley. In nine appearances for West Ham he failed to score and had a tame penalty saved in a 2–2 away draw against Everton. In June 2010, West Ham decided not to offer him a new contract.|$|E

2500|$|On immigration, Carswell {{appears to}} favour {{moderate}} levels of immigration based on skill and work-capacity. Shortly after joining UKIP, Carswell wrote on his blog: [...] "On {{the subject of}} immigration, let me make it absolutely clear: I'm not against immigration. The one thing more ugly than nativism is angry nativism." [...] He has also said: [...] "We should welcome those that want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> contribute ... There's hardly a hospital, GP surgery or supermarket {{in the country that}} could run without that skill and drive." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “The {{ministry}} {{is not like}} the Senate. The {{ministry is}} not a Congress for anyone <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> express his opinion. The ministry has no capacity for that. The ministry is altogether filled up with a fighting spirit. I do not control any church. All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality. They can express their opinions, but they may {{have nothing to do}} with this ministry... This does not mean that I ask you to stay away from your local church or that your local church is no longer a local church... I am not talking about the churches, I am talking about the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul’s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.” ...|$|E
