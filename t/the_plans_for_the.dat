5|$|As {{the first}} new high school built in several years, many unorthodox ideas were suggested. After many of the ideas were criticized the school {{district}} requested parental input on {{the direction of the}} school's curriculum and held meetings around the city to show their plans for the curriculum. School officials wished to create a balance of college prep classes and vocational programs. The school was planned as and is now a citywide magnet school with no attendance boundary. An emphasis on technology was integrated into <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> school.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new ballpark, and prior to the 2008 season, more than $1million in upgrades and repairs were made to Greer Stadium.

5|$|I-287 was to {{continue}} past I-95 in Port Chester and was to cross Long Island Sound via the unbuilt Oyster Bay–Rye Bridge.

Then, I-287 was again to be extended into Jones Beach by merging with the Wantagh State Parkway in Merrick. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bridge, and the I-287 extension onto Long Island, were dropped in 1973 by Governor Nelson Rockefeller {{as a result of}} community opposition and environmental concerns.|$|E

Accordingly, he decided to change <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> operation, with all of the bombers now flying to Yagodnik first and mounting the attack from that airfield. Harris ordered the attack force to depart that afternoon, before advising the Air Ministry or Soviets of the change in plans.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{constructing}} a road up Whiteface Mountain was first conceived {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries by Marcellus Leonard, an entrepreneur from Saranac Lake. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> highway {{began to take shape}} in the 1920s when the land for the road was given by its owner to the state of New York on the condition that it would be named after America's Great War veterans. The road was later renamed to honor veterans from all wars. Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the dedication for the highway in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Australian and United States air units {{began their}} pre-invasion attacks on north Borneo in late May. The first {{attack on the}} Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May, and {{included}} a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan. A large number of further attacks were conducted to suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north-western and north-eastern Borneo. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan, but delays in rebuilding the airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced {{the scale of the}} pre-invasion bombardment.|$|E

5|$|Bagration {{called for}} the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bagration were sound, he worried {{about the possibility of}} a German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.|$|E
5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E

5|$|General Henry Rawlinson {{served on}} Kitchener's staff during the advance on Omdurman, in 1898, {{and served with}} {{distinction}} in the Second Boer War, where he {{earned a reputation as}} one of the most able British commanders. Rawlinson took command of the British IV Corps in 1914 and then command of the Fourth Army in 1916, as <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Allied offensive on the Somme were being developed. During the war, Rawlinson was noted for his willingness to use innovative tactics, which he employed during the battle of Amiens, where he combined attacks by tanks with artillery.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{attempted}} {{to increase the}} power of Southern's locomotives. In 1923, engineers under his direction created <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> P-4 class of Pacific type locomotives, which became famous and {{a symbol of the}} Southern Railway. On a visit to England, Harrison had seen the paint scheme used by the London and North Eastern Railway, which used apple green-painted engines. Returning home in 1925, he ordered the newly delivered Pacifics painted a forest green, which he called Virginia, with gold lettering and silver trim. The roof of each engine was painted brick red. These engines pulled the newly refurbished passenger trains that Harrison had begun work on before the war. He also instituted new passenger lines. In 1921 the Suwannee River Special began to run between Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland down to Tampa and St. Petersburg in Florida. The Crescent Limited began service in 1925 between New Orleans and New York, with a scheduled time for the one-way trip of 37hours and 50minutes.|$|E
5|$|Henry the Young King {{fought a}} short war {{with his brother}} Richard in 1183 over the status of England, Normandy and Aquitaine. Henry II moved in support of Richard, and Henry the Young King died from {{dysentery}} {{at the end of}} the campaign. With his primary heir dead, Henry rearranged <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> succession: Richard was to be made King of England, albeit without any actual power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would retain Brittany; and John would now become the Duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard refused to give up Aquitaine; Henry II was furious and ordered John, with help from Geoffrey, to march south and retake the duchy by force. The two attacked the capital of Poitiers, and Richard responded by attacking Brittany. The war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation in England at the end of 1184.|$|E
