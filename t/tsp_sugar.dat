5000|$|... "Scald 2 cups of {{milk and}} 3/4 cup {{shortening}} (butter or lard, or 1/2 each) in a small saucepan. Cool to body temperature then add 2 tbsp. yeast. In separate mixing bowl, sift 3 cups of flour, then add 2 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 <b>tsp.</b> <b>sugar.</b> Add milk mixture to flour. Mix well, then add additional flour and kneed. The dough should be slightly softer than bread dough, and not sticky (approx. 5 cups of flour). Cover and let rise {{in a warm place}} until doubled in size or more, about an hour. Form dough into small balls the size of a walnut, placing one dough ball on top of another to form a snowman shape; the ball on the top should be slightly smaller than the one on the bottom. Let them rise again, around 30 min.. Bake in a hot oven at 410ºF for 20-25 min or until bottoms are golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature." ...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundReducing added sugars intake {{is one of}} the Healthy People 2020 objectives. High added sugars intake may be {{associated}} with adverse health consequences. ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study identified sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with added sugars intake among US adults (18 years and older) using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n= 24, 967). MethodsThe outcome variable was added sugars intake from foods and beverages using scoring algorithms to convert dietary screener frequency responses on nine items to estimates of individual dietary intake of added sugars in teaspoons per day. Added sugars intake was categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, highest) stratified by sex. The explanatory variables were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the highest and middle tertile added sugars intake groups as compared with the lowest tertile group. ResultsEstimated median added sugars intake was 17. 6 tsp/d for men and 11. 7 tsp/d for women. For men and women, those who had significantly greater odds for being in the highest tertile of added sugars intake (men: 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp/d; women: 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp/d) were younger, less educated, had lower income, were less physically active, were current smokers, and were former or current infrequent/light drinkers, whereas non-Hispanic other/multiracial and those living in the West had significantly lower odds for being in the highest tertile of added sugars intake. Different patterns were found by sex. Non-Hispanic black men had lower odds for being in the highest tertile of added sugars intake, whereas non-Hispanic black women had greater odds for being in the highest tertile. ConclusionsOne in three men consumed 22 ̆ 030522. 0 <b>tsp</b> added <b>sugars</b> and one in three women consumed 22 ̆ 030514. 6 <b>tsp</b> added <b>sugars</b> daily. Higher added sugars intake was associated with various sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics; this information can inform efforts to design programs and policies specific to high-intake populations.

40|$|Drought is a {{worldwide}} problem, getting more serious with global climate change. Among various strategies, seed priming is the simplest approach for improving drought tolerance in crop plants. Seed priming treatments were applied by soaking seeds in aerated solution of 1 % mannose (56 mM) and 10 mM mannitol for 8 h while 100 μM H 2 O 2 for 5 h. Seeds soaked in aerated water (hydropriming) and non-primed seed {{were used as}} controls. Drought stress significantly reduced the seedling fresh weight and leaf relative water content. Pre-sowing seed treatment with mannitol significantly increased the seedling, root and shoot fresh as well as dry weights under non-stress condition. Moreover, H 2 O 2 increased the root length; seedling and root dry weights while mannose increased the shoot dry weight under drought stress. Leaf relative water content (RWC) improved after mannitol and H 2 O 2 priming under drought and non-stressed conditions. Hydropriming increased the root and shoot fresh weights, shoot dry weight and RWC under non-stress condition while seedling, root, shoot fresh weights and shoot dry weight along with raised <b>TSP,</b> MDA, reducing <b>sugars</b> under drought stress. Drought stress raised the total soluble protein (TSP), protease, APX and POD activities, MDA and reducing sugars in leaves. Mannitol and H 2 O 2 confiscate the drought-induced increase in TSP while H 2 O 2 significantly increase it under non-stress condition. Drought stress reduced the catalase activity in leaves while H 2 O 2 and mannitol priming brought it back to control level. Drought stress elevated the MDA in leaves and H 2 O 2 treatment prevented this increase. Only mannose priming rose the reducing sugars in leaves under non-stress condition. Under drought, mannose and mannitol priming raised the reducing sugars in the leaves as a tactic for osmotic adjustment. In conclusion, seed priming treatments ameliorated the drought tolerance in wheat by elevating the level of antioxidants, reducing oxidative damage of biomolecules and accumulating more reducing sugars for osmotic adjustments...|$|R
