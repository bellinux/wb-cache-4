5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a new language}} feature that is a hybrid of labels and procedures. It is closely related <b>to</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a functional subroutine, and includes conventional labels and jumping as a special, but probably not most useful, case. It is independent of assignment, i. e., it {{can be added to}} a “purely-functional” (“non-imperative”) system (such as lisp without pseudo-functions or program feature). Experiments in purely functional programming suggest that its main use will be in success/failure situations, and failure actions. This innovation is incorporated in the projected experimental system, iswim.

500|$|The revamped show in 2014 {{received}} acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph acclaimed the revamped show {{praising the}} singer's sex appeal {{and noted that}} although the set included many new songs, the singer [...] "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs". Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list {{was better than the}} original one describing the tour as [...] "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, [...] "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, [...] "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click of her fingers, and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her chest. She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours." [...] David Pollock of The Independent felt that, [...] "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era. It was, at the very least, one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year, and with barely a drop of minutely-choreographed sweat to be seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} anecdotes of Henriette's career, and many stories {{from her own}} memoirs as well. One known incident, causing great amusement among the public, took place when she played Susanna in Figaro in 1821. The male singer who played Figaro, Edvard du Puy (the very same person {{who was responsible for}} the dismissal of Wässelia described above), invited her to his room to rehearse the play, but when she arrived he tried to seduce her. She declined the offer and left, which made him much disappointed. The next day she did not know her part, and du Puy then reported her to the director, who placed her on house arrest in her rooms for delaying the rehearsals. She was deeply angered by this treatment, and when the caretaker wanted to put extra locks on her door, she threatened <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window. [...] She was comforted by her colleagues, who visited her and cheered her up with a little party meant {{to see if it was}} legal to place women on arrest—unfortunately, it was; this was one of the disciplinary rules that the actors later demanded to be removed in the great strike led by Ulrik Torsslow and Sara Fredrica Strömstedt-Torsslow in 1827.|$|E

Believing it too risky to let Paige and Mari go, the gang kidnaps them and uses their car to leave town. While Krug searches for the highway, Mari convinces {{him to take a}} road that leads to her parents' lake house; Mari then attempts <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle, but the ensuing fight among the passengers causes Krug to crash into a tree. Frustrated by Mari's attempt at escape, Sadie and Francis proceed to beat Mari as she crawls from the wreckage. Krug attempts to teach Justin to [...] "be a man" [...] by forcing him to fondle Mari's breasts. Paige begins insulting him to get him to stop; in response, Krug and Francis stab Paige repeatedly, and Mari watches her friend bleed to death. Krug then rapes Mari. When he is done, Mari musters enough strength to escape the group and make it to the lake so that she can swim to safety. Before she can swim far enough, Krug shoots her in the back, leaving her body floating in the lake.|$|E
2500|$|It is also umpire's {{interference}} when an umpire {{is struck}} by a fair batted ball before it touches a fielder including the pitcher or passes near an infielder other than the pitcher. [...] This can occur either because an umpire is inside the diamond or because the ball crosses 1st or 3rd base in fair territory then hooks or slices foul into the umpire positioned just outside the line behind the bag. [...] In this case, the ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, and all other runners advance only if forced. [...] A common example is when a batter hits a fair ball down the first base line so hard that the first base umpire can't avoid it. Even though the hit would have surely been a bases-clearing double or triple without the interference, {{it is only a}} single and runners advance no more than one base. [...] This happened in the 1989 All-Star Game when the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bobby Bonilla led off the 9th with a scorching grounder that would have been an easy double, but it hit first base umpire Bob Engel in the legs as he tried <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way.

In the intro of [...] "The Simpsons Movie", Mr. Burns is seen in his bathroom trying to brush his teeth. After Smithers applies the toothpaste onto his brush, he falls over. In [...] "Rosebud" [...] and [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", he needed {{a great deal of}} effort to wrench items from Maggie. He has difficulty performing such simple actions as giving a thumbs-up, and crushing an insect by stepping on it, or using a door-knocker.

He pitched the opening baseball at a game in [...] "Dancin' Homer", but was only able to throw it a small distance, which drew mocking laughter from the crowd. When Mr. Burns joined Homer's bowling team in [...] "Team Homer", he was barely able to roll the ball down the lane. In season five's [...] "Burns' Heir", Smithers puts a sponge on Mr. Burns' head before leaving the bathroom, causing him to nearly drown in the tub from its weight. In [...] "Lady Bouvier's Lover" [...] however, he shows himself as a lively, excellent dancer.|$|E
2500|$|Peacock bass {{make for}} great {{aquarium}} fish if {{kept in a}} large enough aquarium. The minimum tank size for an adult {{of one of the}} smaller species (e.g. C. ocellaris) would be 180 gallons, and nothing less than a 300-gallon tank should be reserved for C. temensis. As with all specialty fish, buy healthy stock from a reputable dealer. [...] Tankmates should be other fish that are too large to swallow, such as arowanas, other large cichlids, and larger members of the Loricariidae family. The peacock bass produces more waste and uses more energy than a typical tropical fish, therefore significant biological filtration and aeration are necessary. [...] Water changes of up to 25% weekly are required with such messy fish. Feeding should be 2 to 3 times a day for young peacock bass (under 4"), decreasing to once a day as they get older, then as an adult they should be fed every other day just enough to round off their stomachs. Peacock bass can be trained to take pellets, though occasionally this is a challenge. Avoid feeding them live goldfish (bait minnows would be a better choice). Even if they do not accept pellets, they may still eat other foods such as krill, bloodworms, and silversides. [...] The temperature of the aquarium should range from 78 to 84°F. Temperature plays a big role on the looks, behavior, and feeding habits of the fish. Lower temperatures cause the fish to eat less, and reduces the efficiency of the immune system. Higher temperatures also affect aggression, making the fish more aggressive. A strong lid is an absolute must with these fish, as they will often bolt and attempt <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the tank if startled. For the same reason, sharp decorations should be avoided in a Cichla tank.|$|E

His associates said that he only dropped out during his senior year of high school to help support the family after his father's heart attack. His graduation picture appears in the school's yearbook. [...] His claims to have never attended school - and his general disavowals of education - may have been related to his experience of dyslexia which, although never officially diagnosed, was obvious to sidemen such as John French and Denny Walley, who observed his difficulty reading cue-cards on stage, and his frequent need to be read aloud to. [...] While attending Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, Van Vliet became close friends with fellow teenager Frank Zappa, the pair bonding through their interest in Chicago blues and R. Van Vliet is portrayed in both The Real Frank Zappa Book and Barry Miles' biography Zappa as fairly spoiled at this stage of his life, the center of attention as an only child. He spent most of his time locked in his room listening to records, often with Zappa, into the early hours in the morning, eating leftover food from his father's Helms bread truck and demanding that his mother bring him a Pepsi. [...] His parents tolerated such behavior under the belief that their child was truly gifted. Vliet's [...] "Pepsi-moods" [...] were ever a source of amusement to band members, leading Zappa to later write the wry tune [...] "Why Doesn't Someone Give Him A Pepsi?" [...] that featured on the Bongo Fury tour.|$|E
