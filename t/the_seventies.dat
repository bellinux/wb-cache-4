5|$|The Inner Ring Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of the 1960s.

2500|$|In 1975, under Kimball's direction, the First Quorum of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy</b> was reconstituted. <b>The</b> First Quorum was {{composed}} of the {{former members of the}} First Council of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy</b> as well as new individuals selected by Kimball. The reason for the change was that the growth of the church necessitated the call of more general authorities. In 1976, the First Council of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy,</b> <b>the</b> First Quorum of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy,</b> and <b>the</b> Assistants to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were all merged into a new First Quorum of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy</b> under a seven-member Presidency of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy.</b> In 1978, some of the older members of <b>the</b> <b>seventy</b> were [...] "retired" [...] as the first general authorities to be given emeritus status. However, members appointed through 1981 were still granted life tenure.|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 1970s, comics aimed at {{children}} gradually disappeared. The new breed of underground, alternative and independent comics was aimed at a more mature audience, which ran counter to the public's perception, as well as to legal restrictions. The first wave of alternative comics in <b>the</b> <b>seventies</b> was largely made up of science fiction and fantasy comics, made by budding cartoonists like Gene Day, Dave Sim, Augustine Funnell, Jim Craig, Ken Steacy, Dean Motter, and Vincent Marchesano.|$|E
5|$|A mid-term poll by CRA in November 2009 {{showed that}} 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams' Progressive Conservatives. His {{popularity}} {{had been in}} <b>the</b> <b>seventies</b> according to polls conducted by the CRA earlier in 2009. Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results, {{the first of which}} was by Global News and Ipsos and the second was by Angus Reid. The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces and found that Williams was by far the most popular premier in Canada. 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams' performance, the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall with 58 percent.|$|E
5|$|Between 1926 and 1972, no Albertosaurus fossils {{were found}} at all; but, since <b>the</b> <b>seventies,</b> {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming, but these probably do not represent A. sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus Albertosaurus.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In <b>the</b> <b>seventies,</b> {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{members of}} the Presidency of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy</b> would often serve as heads of various church ecclesiastical departments. This {{practice}} changed in 2004, when area presidencies in the United States and Canada were dissolved; these areas were put directly {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Presidency of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy.</b> <b>The</b> management of these areas is currently the primary responsibility of the Presidency of <b>the</b> <b>Seventy.</b>|$|R

25|$|As a body, <b>the</b> <b>seventy</b> in <b>the</b> LDS Church are {{considered}} to be equal in priesthood authority with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

However, in such circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>seventy</b> would be required to act unanimously.|$|R
