5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters <b>that</b> <b>use</b> non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters <b>that</b> <b>use</b> floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E

5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating {{the expression of}} CXCR4 {{on the surface of}} these cells. HIV <b>that</b> <b>use</b> only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those <b>that</b> <b>use</b> only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those <b>that</b> <b>use</b> both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E

5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets <b>that</b> <b>use</b> canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
5|$|An f-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} {{a record of the}} fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location fix is any position estimate of the storm center. An intensity fix is any estimate of the storm's intensity. Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low-level penetrations through the storm center. Various methods <b>that</b> <b>use</b> satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E

5|$|Anti-vitamins are {{chemical}} compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins. For example, avidin is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits {{the absorption of}} biotin; it is deactivated by cooking. Pyrithiamine, a synthetic compound, has a molecular structure similar to thiamine, vitamin B1, and inhibits the enzymes <b>that</b> <b>use</b> thiamine.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs <b>that</b> <b>use</b> {{inorganic}} electron donors and organotrophs <b>that</b> <b>use</b> organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications <b>that</b> <b>use</b> it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Books and scripts <b>that</b> <b>use</b> {{the general}} story line of Austen's novels but change or {{otherwise}} modernise the story also became popular {{at the end}} of the 20th century. Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both Pride and Prejudice and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production Bride and Prejudice, which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.
