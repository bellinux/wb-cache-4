40|$|A {{series of}} tests was {{undertaken}} on a recirculation scheme in a deep level gold mine to establish the effect of controlled recirculation of the mine ventilation air on blast contaminant dissipation. Clarification was needed {{as to whether the}} existing re-entry interval of three hours would have to be extended with the introduction of controlled recirculation. <b>The</b> <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> is a time interval, after blasting, stipulated by the Inspector of Mines during which the workings are being cleared of blast contaminants and during which time no persons are permitted tc enter the workings. The fresh and recirculated air flow rates were varied and their effects on blast contaminant dissipation measured. Gas concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen (N 0 X) and carbon monoxide were monitored continuously in the return air. Dust levels were monitored in the return air from two hours before the blast to four hours after the blast. Two gas models (mixed-volume and plug-flow) and residence time analysis were used to analyse the data. In all the tests, the critical blast contaminant for determining <b>the</b> <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> was found to be NO*. In addition, the following parameters affected the re-entry interval; the amount of explosives ignited daily, the volume of the workings into which the NO* is dissipated by the ventilating air, the time taken for air to complete one circuit (the cycle time), leakage and short circuiting of air, and the fresh air flow rate. The recirculated air flow rate was found to have negligible effect on <b>the</b> <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval...</b>|$|E

40|$|Phase {{distribution}} of airborne chemicals {{is important because}} intake and uptake mechanisms of each phase are different. The phase distribution and concentrations are needed to determine strategies of exposure assessment, hazard control, and worker protection. However, procedures for establishing phase distribution and concentration have not been standardized. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare measurements of an airborne semivolatile pesticide (chlorpyrifos) by phase using two different procedures. Six pesticide applications in two facilities were studied and at each site, samples were collected for three time slots: T 1, the first 1 or 2 hr after the commencement of application; T 2, a 6 -hr period immediately following T 1; and T 3, a 6 -hr period after <b>the</b> required <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> (24 hr for chlorpyrifos). Two phase-separating devices were co-located at the center of each greenhouse: semivolatile aerosol dichotomous sampler (SADS) using flow rates of 1. 8 l x min(- 1) and 0. 2 l x min(- 1), corresponding to a total inlet flow rate of 2. 0 l x min(- 1) with a vapor phase flow fraction of 0. 1; and an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), along with a standard OVS XAD- 2 tube. Chlorpyrifos in vapor and particulate form in a SADS sampling train and that in vapor form in an ESP sampling train were collected in OVS tubes. Chlorpyrifos in particulate form in the ESP setting would have been collected on aluminum substrate. However, no chlorpyrifos in particulate form was recovered from the ESP. Overall (vapor plus particle) concentrations measured by OVS ranged 11. 7 - 186. 6 /m(3) at T 1 and decreased on average 77. 1...|$|R
40|$|In 12 {{greenhouses}} for chrysanthemum {{culture in}} the Netherlands, dermal exposure to hand and forearms, and respiratory exposure to chlorothalonil during harvesting activities have been measured. Two harvesting techniques were compared, during which respectively the highest and lowest levels of exposure were expected. The difference between both techniques was the way some actions (removing leaves and clods) were carried out: manually or automatically with a harvesting machine. It was observed that dermal exposure differed for the various harvesting techniques. The exposure was on average 3. 6 mg/h for manual harvesting, and 1. 1 mg/h for automatic harvesting. Re-entry time had a large influence on exposure. Working after a relatively short <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> (11 - 17 days) resulted in an exposure of about a factor 6 to 9 higher than after a long <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> (32 - 56 days).

40|$|In this study, <b>the</b> {{atmospheric}} <b>re-entry</b> onto Earth and Mars is analysed concerning uncertainties. These uncertainties {{can arise}} in the modelling and the initial entry angle and velocity during <b>the</b> <b>re-entry</b> leading to hazards and malfunctions influencing the mission success. Therefore, the temporal evolution of uncertainties throughout <b>the</b> <b>re-entry,</b> descent and landing is examined using the Stochastic Liouville Equation. This equation yields probability density functions depending on {{the states of the}} system dynamics and the time. From this a most probable trajectory together with 1 -sigma and 3 -sigma error bars can be estimated giving an impression on the influence of uncertainties. Furthermore, the covariance matrices are deduced from the probability density functions generating landing dispersions at the end time of <b>the</b> <b>re-entry.</b> Beside ballistic trajectories also optimal trajectories for manoeuvrable re-entry vehicles are analysed. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>re-entry</b> vehicle is controllable in its flight path angle and the trajectories are optimized concerning the descent time...|$|R
