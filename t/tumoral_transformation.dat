40|$|The {{regulation}} of redox homeostasis {{is an important}} field of study in cancer research. Actually, redox alterations is a mechanism that favours the clonal expansion of neoplastic cells. Thus, the multi-step pathway of neoplastic progression often includes mutations of the genes encoding the molecular machinery responsible of redox homeostasis. In this project {{we will try to}} identify a “mitochondrial functional module” operating during redox stress. The possibility that mitochondria could act as targets of redox alterations during <b>tumoral</b> cell <b>transformation</b> is an intriguing hypothesis supported by some considerations: mitochondria are the major source and the most proximal targets of reactive oxygen species and they regulate stress response and apoptosis, moreover agents perturbing mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis change the susceptibility of the cells to apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which mitochondria participate in the redox-dependent cellular neoplastic transformation is still unclear. The elucidation of these signalling pathways is the focus of this grant application. The work will focus on the identification of a “mitochondrial functional module” acting during redox stress. Much of a cell’s activity is in fact organized as a module composed by interacting molecules. In particular we will try to identify the molecules involved in mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis during redox changes (such as oxidant, reducing or antioxidants treatments) and the relevance of this regulation for the modulation of organelle function and cell fate. To this end we will pursue the preliminary results already obtained on the effects of redox stress on mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis, by investigating on the one hand their consequences on global cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis, on the other the role of these changes on the sensitivity to apoptosis induced by different stimuli. We will then investigate the intracellular effectors of the redox mediated signals focusing on proteins interacting with the mitochondria. We will also investigate, by a variety of experimental approaches, the molecular mechanisms underlying the participation of these organelles during redox stress in different tumors. Finally, when a mitochondrial functional module will be identified, the expression profile of the proteins involved will be evaluated in normal and neoplastic cells. In these studies, we will employ a variety of experimental approaches that allow to image intracellular organelle structure, Ca 2 + signals and effector proteins in living cells, including novel techniques (e. g. use of specifically targeted recombinant probes). Thus, in this grant proposal, we will combine the experimental approaches, the scientific know-how of the PI and the fundamental support from different external collaborators that ensure unique experience and expertise in all the fields, essentials for a new and young research unit. In conclusion, we believe that the identification of the “mitochondrial functional module” acting during redox-dependent neoplastic cellular transformation, with the elucidation of the intracellular targets and the molecules involved, can potentially reveal new pharmacological targets and allow in vitro test of the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments to better identify the appropriate in vivo therapy...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} {{about the role of}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as cancer stem cells in many sarcomas. Nevertheless, little is still known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying MSCs transformation. We aimed at investigating the role of p 53 and p 21, two important regulators of the cell cycle progression and apoptosis normally involved in protection against tumorigenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells from wild-type, p 21 -/-p 53 +/+, and p 21 -/-p 53 +/- mice were cultured in vitro and analyzed for the appearance of <b>tumoral</b> <b>transformation</b> properties after low, medium, and high number of passages both in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type or p 21 -/-p 53 +/+ MSCs did not show any sign of <b>tumoral</b> <b>transformation.</b> Indeed, after short-term in vitro culture, wild-type MSCs became senescent, and p 21 -/-p 53 +/+ MSCs showed an elevated spontaneous apoptosis rate. Conversely, MSCs carrying a mutation in one allele of the p 53 gene (p 21 -/-p 53 +/- MSCs) completely lost p 53 expression after in vitro long-term culture. Loss of p 53 was accompanied by {{a significant increase in the}} growth rate, gain of karyotypic instability, loss of p 16 expression, and lack of senescence response. Finally, these cells were able to form fibrosarcomas partially differentiated into different mesenchymal lineages when injected in immunodeficient mice both after subcutaneous and intrafemoral injection. These findings show that MSCs are very sensitive to mutations in genes involved in cell cycle control and that these deficiencies can be at the origin of some mesodermic tumors.

40|$|Of the antigens {{recognized}} {{on human}} tumors by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes, all those defined thus {{far have been}} identified on melanoma or renal cell carcinoma. We report here the identification of an antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes on a human squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. The antigen is encoded by a mutated form of the CASP- 8 gene. This gene, also named FLICE or MACH, codes for protease caspase- 8, which is required for induction of apoptosis through the Fas receptor and tumor necrosis factor receptor- 1. The mutation, which {{was found in the}} tumor cells but not in the normal cells of the patient, modifies the stop codon and adds an Alu repeat to the coding region, thereby lengthening the protein by 88 amino acids. The ability of the altered protein to trigger apoptosis appears to be reduced relative to the normal caspase- 8. The antigenic peptide is a nonamer presented by HLA-B* 3503. The five last amino acids are encoded by the extension of the reading frame caused by the mutation.

40|$|Background: Clear cell renal cell {{carcinoma}} (ccRCC) {{is the most common}} type of renal cancer. One of the processes disturbed in this cancer type is alternative splicing, although phenomena underlying these disturbances remain unknown. Alternative splicing consists of selective removal of introns and joining of residual exons of the primary transcript, to produce mRNA molecules of different sequence. Splicing aberrations may lead to <b>tumoral</b> <b>transformation</b> due to synthesis of impaired splice variants with oncogenic potential. In this paper we hypothesized that disturbed alternative splicing in ccRCC may result from improper expression of splicing factors, mediators of splicing reactions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using real-time PCR and Western-blot analysis we analyzed expression of seven splicing factors belonging to SR proteins family (SF 2 /ASF, SC 35, SRp 20, SRp 75, SRp 40, SRp 55 and 9 G 8), and one non-SR factor, hnRNP A 1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 1) in 38 pairs of tumor-control ccRCC samples. Moreover, we analyzed splicing patterns of five genes involved in carcinogenesis and partially regulated by analyzed splicing factors: RON, CEACAM 1, Rac 1, Caspase- 9, and GLI 1. Conclusions/Significance: We found that the mRNA expression of splicing factors was disturbed in tumors when compared to paired controls, similarly as levels of SF 2 /ASF and hnRNP A 1 proteins.

Proteomic is a valuable tool for hMSC characterization and identification of possible changes during expansion. Results We used Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time Of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-ToF-MS) to evaluate the presence of stable molecular markers in adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSC) produced under conditions of good manufacturing practices (GMP). Proteomic patterns of cells prepared were consistent, with 4 up-regulated peaks (mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 8950, 10087, 10345, and 13058) through subculture steps (P 0 -P 7) with similar trend in three donors. Among the differentially expressed proteins found in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, a cytoplasmic 10. 1 kDa protein was upregulated during culture passages and was identified as S 100 A 6 (Calcyclin).

The most abundant isoenzyme co-eluted with hexokinase type II from rat adipose tissue and displayed a Km for glucose of 0. 15 mM, similar to the adipose-tissue enzyme. Hexokinase type II was in large part associated with a particulate subcellular fraction in RIN-m 5 F cells. The two other hexokinases separated by ion-exchange chromatography were an enzyme similar to hexokinase type I from brain and glucokinase (or hexokinase type IV). The latter isoenzyme was identified as the liver-type glucokinase by the following properties: co-elution with hepatic glucokinase from DEAE-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex; sigmoid saturation kinetics with glucose with half-maximal velocity at 5. 6 mM and Hill coefficient (h) of 1. 54; suppression of enzyme activity by antibodies raised against rat liver glucokinase; apparent Mr of 56, 500 and pI of 5. 6, as shown by immunoblotting after one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; peptide map identical with that of hepatic glucokinase after proteolysis with chymotrypsin and papain. These data indicate that the gene coding for hepatic glucokinase is expressed in RIN-m 5 F cells, a finding consistent with indirect evidence {{for the presence of}} glucokinase in the beta-cell of the islet of Langerhans.

Increased concentrations of growth hormone (GH) or prolactin (PRL) are observed in about 30 % of thyrotropinomas leading to acromegaly or disturbed sexual functions beyond thyrotropin (TSH) -induced hyperthyroidism. Regulation of non-TSH pituitary hormones {{in this context}} is not well understood. We there therefore evaluated TSH, GH and PRL secretion in 6 patients with up-to-date analytical and mathematical tools by 24 -h blood sampling at 10 -min intervals in a clinical research laboratory. The profiles were analyzed with a new deconvolution method, approximate entropy, cross-approximate entropy, cross-correlation and cosinor regression. TSH burst frequency and basal and pulsatile secretion were increased in patients compared with controls. TSH secretion patterns in patients were more irregular, but the diurnal rhythm was preserved at a higher mean with a 2. 5  h phase delay. Although only one patient had clinical acromegaly, GH secretion and IGF-I levels were increased in two other patients and all three had a significant cross-correlation between the GH and TSH. PRL secretion was increased in one patient, but all patients had a significant cross-correlation with TSH and showed decreased PRL regularity. Cross-ApEn synchrony between TSH and GH did not differ between patients and controls, but TSH and PRL synchrony was reduced in patients. We conclude that TSH secretion by thyrotropinomas shares many characteristics of other pituitary hormone-secreting adenomas. In addition, abnormalities in GH and PRL secretion exist ranging from decreased (joint) regularity to overt hypersecretion, although not always clinically obvious, suggesting <b>tumoral</b> <b>transformation</b> of thyrotrope lineage cells...|$|E

Staphylococcus aureus biofilms cause {{persistent}} chronic {{infections that}} require repeated antibiotic treatments at high doses.

Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18 FluoroDeoxyGlucose (18 FDG) {{has been widely}} used in cancer diagnosis, since the <b>tumoral</b> <b>transformation</b> usually increases the expression of glucose transporter and glycolytic enzymes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of 18 FDG-PET imaging for in vivo monitoring of bacterial biofilm infections in mice. For this, sealed catheters of VialonTM biomaterial were pre-colonized with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 15981, and subcutaneously implanted in mice (n= 5). The in vivo infections were monitored at days 1, 7 and 14 post-infection, in a micro-PET scanner (Mosaic, Philips), 1 hour after intravenous injection of 18 FDG. Images were quantitatively analysed by means of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV 60) index. In parallel, the number of CFU/catheter and lesions induced by the infected catheter were determined. Similarly, the usefulness of this mouse model was assessed, after oral treatment with rifampin. SUV 60 indexes were calculated in the catheter area and in the regional lymph nodes, associated to high number of both bacteria and PMN cells around the catheter. After antibiotic treatment, both SUV 60 index and CFU/catheter decreased drastically, and lymph node images became negative. In conclusion, this study represents an advance for the in vivo monitoring of biofilm infections and follow-up evaluation of the efficacy of antibiotic therapies in living mice. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

In our melanoma cell lines, showed different levels of phosphorylated eIF 2 alpha and phosphorylated ERK, which were higher in the cell lines derived from metastatic tumours as compared to primary melanoma cell lines. We showed that after treatment with a MEK inhibitor, ERK phosphorylation was inhibited while eIF 2 alpha phosphorylation was enhanced in all melanoma cell lines. Moreover Western blotting and confocal analyses revealed that phosphorylated eIF 2 alpha was localized in the nucleus of melanoma cell lines, supporting a possible relationship between phosphorylation levels and subcellular localization of phosphorylated eIF 2 alpha and cell proliferation in malignant melanoma...|$|E

40|$|Systemic {{treatment}} of cancer requires tumour-selective therapies that eliminate cancer cells yet preserve healthy tissues from undesired damage. <b>Tumoral</b> <b>transformation</b> {{is associated with}} profound effects in translational reprogramming of gene expression, such that tumour-specific translational regulation presents an attractive possibility for generating oncoselective therapies. We recently discovered that mRNA translational control by cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding proteins (CPEBs) is reactivated in cancer. Here we present a novel approach to restrict genetic-engineered therapies to malignant tissues based on CPEB translational regulation of target mRNAs. We demonstrate that tumour reprogramming of CPEB-mediated mRNA stability and translational regulation modulates tumour-specific expression of viral proteins. For oncolytic adenoviruses, insertion of CPE regulatory sequences in the 3 '-untranslated region of the E 1 A gene provides oncoselectivity, with full potency in cancer cells but attenuated in normal tissues. Our results demonstrate the potential of this strategy to improve oncolytic virus design and {{provide a framework for}} exploiting CPE-regulated transgenes for therapy.

Fecha de lectura: 13 - 07 - 2004 B lymphocytes {{are generated}} continuosly from pluripotential stem {{cells in the}} bone marrow, and after their maturation. they migrate to the peripheral lymphoid organs where they interact with antigens. The wntact with the antigen starts serial changes that finish {{with the emergence of}} immunoglobulin seaeting plasma cells, that are the efector cdls of the humora immune responses. Along t'his process, phenotypic and molealar changes take place. Amonc them, changes at the level of several transwiption fadm are of particular interest r Blimp- 1 has been postulated in initial in vüm works performed in tumoral cells models as an essential factor in the process of differentiation from B cells to plasma cells. The present work. is focused in the analysis of induction of Blimpl transcripüon in normal B cells analizing if it is a necessary request in these cells for the produdion of plasma cells in dierent situations of cellular activation. We examined the requirements of Blimp- 1 expression in B cells stimulated with T cellindependent (TI) or T a l l dependent (TD) stimulation N, vih, using treatments with antisense oligonucleotides speciñc of Wimpl. Our results suggest that Blimp- 1 upregulation is nBCCesary in the first time of the early generation of IgM pm-plasma and plasma cells in TI responses. Blimp- 1 activity is not necesary for the emergente of plasma cells in which a switch has taken place to lgGl in twi NI vitro models of TD stimulation. On the other hand, we have analiued the role of several interleukins in Blimp- 1 expression and in the N, vihD normal B cells d i n t i a t i o n lo plasma cells. We have obsetved that although in LPS activated B lymphocytes thre is an upregulation in the expresián levels of. IL- 2, 11 - 5, IL- 6, and IL- 10, none of them represents a necessary requirement to produce growing or dierentiation of LPS edivated B cells. Nevertheless, they still {{may play a role in}} the ampliñcalion of the LPS induced humoral immune response. The program of differentiation to plasma cells generated by Blimp- 1, produce changes in the expresión levels of difierent genes related with the wntrol of proliferation and cellular growing (Pax- 5 y c-myc), apoptosis (Al, MAD-Q, and genes required for plasma cells funcions (Xbpl). We have analized the relation between Blimp- 1 expresión and these genes, showing that Blimpl is selectively expressed in a plasma and preplasma IgM+CD 43 +Syn& cell population in which the expresión level of P& is downregulated, before the upregulation of Xbpl expression takes place. The high level of Blimp- 1 expressior) is also correlated with the repression of c-myc and Al, and the upregulation of MAD- 4, that may contribute to thc mechanism cell cycle arrest that happens previous to plasma cells emergence, and for thf apoptosis induced by Blimp- 1 expression in partially activated cells. Finally due to the desaibed tendency of B- 1 cells to easily dierentiate to IgM secreting plasma cells we a n a l i i the levels of Wimpl expreseion in isolated B- 1 and 8 - 2 cells. We found very high expresión levels of Blimp- 1 in B- 1 cells, that could also be related to the hight rata of survival and the tendency to the <b>tumoral</b> <b>transformation</b> found in these cell...|$|E
