5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source,</b> through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E

5|$|Day of Defeat: Source is a team-based online first-person shooter {{multiplayer}} {{video game}} developed by Valve Corporation. Set in World War II, {{the game is}} a remake of Day of Defeat.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows on September 26, 2005, distributed through Valve's online content delivery service Steam.

5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg first {{contacted}} screenwriter David Self {{to adapt}} the story into a feature film. Self wrote an initial draft that remained close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel and leaving the core elements of the story. Some of the harsher aspects of the story were toned down as the script became more streamlined; for example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an alcoholic, but this element was ultimately absent from the final version.|$|E

5|$|The various musical themes {{associated}} with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire Ring cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies and phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, {{on the night before}} he died in Venice, in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether. This implies that the radio source significantly expanded {{in the time that}} had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit in Prime, in which the latter was previously unlocked by connecting the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, who also {{have a copy of}} Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number as opposed to a separate Friend Code. Save files from the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but is limited to a local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the difficulty of the encounters was lowered.|$|E

5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source.</b> Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E

On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race.

5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>source.</b> The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E
