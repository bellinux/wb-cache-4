5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E

5|$|Many of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> revolt used pseudonyms, {{particularly}} in the letters sent {{around the country to}} encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rebels}} had urban backgrounds, and the {{majority}} of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants. In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the urban poor, attempting to gain {{at the expense of the}} local elites. In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. Other urban rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.|$|E

Port Charlotte's unit is a member of NJROTC Area Seven, and is known for service to its community.|$|E
5|$|The {{clock and}} {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} the men {{galvanized}} the missionary effort in the United States, sparking an outpouring of funding for evangelization efforts around the world.

Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, Elisabeth, and the sister of Nate Saint, Rachel, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) to live among the Huaorani. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> killing.

5|$|The {{petitions}} {{and political}} crisis continued to {{the reign of}} Hamad (1923–42) who —encouraged by the British— began it by setting up a criminal court to try <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> violence including his first cousins, the Khalids. The ruler was put in a dilemma between his tribal alignment and public law, and so he exiled his cousins, but paid their expenses. The Khalids, however, held a deep grudge against residents of Sitra who witnessed against them, and in 1924 attacked the island before their exile, killing several Shia men, women and children. The attackers were sentenced to death following major Shia protests and a lengthy second trial, but managed to escape before the sentence was carried out. Their father was confined to Manama. The trials {{marked the first time}} in Bahrain's history that members of the ruling family were convicted.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> revolt of 1381 were not represented in Parliament and were excluded from its decision-making.

Some of them later {{claimed to have been}} forced to join the revolt by the rebels. Clergy also formed part of the revolt; as well as the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of the revolt in the south-east. Some were pursuing local grievances, some were disadvantaged and suffering relative poverty, and others appear to have been motivated by strong radical beliefs.|$|E

Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.|$|E
