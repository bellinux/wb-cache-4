We.. everything together around an invisible campfire; everyone picking up different instruments and playing them on a moment's notice. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> some holiday magic in the air that week.|$|E
25|$|After the {{campaign}} in Amenhotep's ninth year, Egyptian and Mitannian armies never fought again, and the two kingdoms seem to have reached some sort of peace. Amenhotep records that the kings of Babylon, the Hittites, and Mitanni came to make peace and pay tribute to him after his ninth year, although this may be outlandish boasting. However, a second passage appears {{on the walls of}} Karnak, saying that the princes of Mitanni came to seek peace with Amenhotep, and this cannot be so easily explained away. The rising power of the Hittites eventually persuaded Mitanni to seek an ally, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> a treaty of some sort between Egypt and Mitanni by the time of Amenhotep's successor, but it may be that it was enacted after Amenhotep's campaigns, to try to prevent any more campaigns of mass deportations. Whenever formal peace was enacted, an informal peace was maintained between Amenhotep and the king of Mitanni. Thereafter, Amenhotep concentrated on domestic matters, with one possible exception. A shrine of Amenhotep's Nubian viceroy shows Amenhotep receiving tribute after a Nubian campaign, but {{it is not possible to}} date when this happened.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

500|$|Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd {{assembled}} for {{an upcoming}} tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album, although their priority {{at that time was}} the creation of new material. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that [...] "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: [...] "I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – {{that a lot of the}} lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific." ...|$|E
500|$|While Kiedis was in rehab, {{the band}} sought a new {{producer}} {{for their next}} album. [...] Aspiring producer Michael Beinhorn was looking for work at EMI Records after several unsuccessful projects on other labels, when a man working at EMI approached Beinhorn and suggested that he work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as [...] "no one [...] {{what to do with}} them". [...] Beinhorn recalled of the situation: [...] "Though their music all seemed kind of abstract, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> an excitement to it. [...] I thought they needed a lot of arrangement help ... I also quickly learned that [...] at the record label actually hated the Chili Peppers, like openly reviled them so bad that they didn't even want them to succeed. [...] It was the weirdest thing." [...] He contacted the band to meet up, and instead of arranging a formal meeting, the band proposed to meet him at a club in New Orleans called Tipitina's. [...] Beinhorn was impressed by the band's originality and non-conformist attitude and decided to work with the band. Kiedis then sat down with Beinhorn to discuss the recording of the album; Kiedis planned to record the album in ten days and write the songs during the recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Copenhagen in the 1830s and 1840s had crooked streets where {{carriages}} rarely went. Kierkegaard {{loved to}} walk them.

2500|$|Mr. Bungle emerged {{after its}} members were kicked out their {{respective}} bands. [...] "It was kinda like a merger between two bands," [...] Mike Patton recalled. [...] "One really horrible gothic metal band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did Metallica covers, {{which is the}} one Trevor and me came from." [...] Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a death metal band, but also dabbled in speed metal, thrash metal, and hardcore punk. And {{within a year of}} formation, the band expanded their sound to include ska. Trevor Dunn noted that, [...] "After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we just stopped and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like Camper Van Beethoven, Oingo Boingo, Bad Manners and kind of ska funk-ish oriented stuff. Then we added a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, so now we don't really have any kind of limit on the music we play." [...] Trey Spruance corroborated this. “When I was 15, I was in a death metal group," [...] Spruance reminisced. [...] "We had this idea {{that we were going to}} play a bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads. We just had this idea, you know: ‘Okay, we’re going to play this ska music, and that’ll be amazing.’ Half of the audience hated us, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> a joy in confronting that wall between styles.” ...|$|E
