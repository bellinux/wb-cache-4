To solve this circumventing problem companies should know better what the preferences of their employees are.

25|$|In 1996, Prior and Wilson {{wrote that}} the Third Battle of Ypres was called a British failure by many writers. Harris and Sheffield called it a Pyrrhic victory. Research over the last 25 years {{suggests}} that British and German commanders thought carefully {{about what they were}} doing, learned quickly and had efficient forces capable of quick changes of method. The capture of Passchendaele Ridge was extremely difficult, due to the skill and determination of the German army and the huge problem of waging war without great advantages in technology or tactics. The course of the Nivelle Offensive earlier in the year, suggest that a campaign of this nature was unavoidable. Smaller limited operations like the Battle of Messines, the Battle of Hill 70, the Second Offensive Battle of Verdun and the Battle of Malmaison, were strikingly successful but were insufficient to force the German army out of France; this was not because of poor generalship but due a form of warfare conducted with means made available by industrialisation, fought by closely matched opponents, who made mistakes but mostly fought with determination, using all the skill and <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> they could find. The defensive methods used by the German army at Arras after 9 April, were not superseded until changes were imposed by Ludendorff after the defeat at Broodseinde on 4 October. The British retained the strategic initiative but failed to capture the Belgian coast and the U-boat bases, although after Broodseinde this was due more to the difficulties of wet weather, than the effectiveness of German resistance.|$|E

25|$|The United States Army {{maintained}} a substantial and continuous military {{presence at the}} inner German border throughout the entire period from 1945 to {{after the end of}} the Cold War. Regular American soldiers manned the border from the end of the war until they were replaced in 1946 by the United States Constabulary, a lightly armed constabulary force responsible for border security. It was disbanded in 1952 after policing duties were transferred to the German authorities. In its place, two dedicated armoured cavalry regiments were assigned to provide a permanent border defence. The 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Nuremberg and the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Fulda– later replaced by the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment– were tasked with monitoring the border using observation posts, ground and air patrols, countering border intrusions and gathering intelligence on Warsaw Pact activities. Unlike their East German counterparts, U.S. soldiers did not stay for more than 30days on the border, though they carried out regular patrols around the clock using foot and helicopter patrols. They also used a variety of <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> such as ground surveillance radars to monitor Warsaw Pact troop movements across the border. A rapid reaction force was on constant duty further behind the border to provide backup in an emergency. The American presence on the border provoked political controversy in Germany. During the 1960s the state of Hesse refused to grant U.S. forces land rights to its observation points or allow them to install paved access roads, electricity or telephone lines. It took the view that since there was no legally recognised border, there was no legal reason for their military observation posts to be built along it. By the 1980s the American border presence had become the target of peace activists, who in 1984 blockaded the U.S. Observation Post Alpha with a human chain. The U.S. withdrew from the inner German border in 1991.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an innovative product design {{system based on}} Quality Function Development (QFD) and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ in Russian abbreviation). House of Quality (HOQ) {{is the core of}} QFD. To make QFD more practical and operable for small and medium-sized companies, a simplified model of HOQ is proposed. A set of reasoning scheme for inferring requirements relationships is adopted to facilitate constructing the HOQ. The contradiction in the process of mechanical design is defined by TRIZ as physical contradiction and technical contradiction. These two contradictions are solved through contradiction matrix and inventive principles of TRIZ. The innovative design system mainly uses the tool of contradiction matrix to solve the bottle techniques attained from QFD. By taking the HOQ as its interface the integration between QFD and TRIZ is realized. After conducting quality function development, two outputs can be obtained. They are the <b>technical</b> <b>measure</b> needing improvement and the <b>technical</b> <b>measure</b> that is getting worse while improving the former one. These two measures are taken as inputs of TRIZ module to analyze and solve the problem of product design...|$|R

2500|$|The {{impact of}} nuclear {{accidents}} {{has been a}} topic of debate since the first nuclear reactors were constructed in 1954, {{and has been a}} key factor in public concern about nuclear facilities. <b>Technical</b> <b>measures</b> {{to reduce the risk of}} accidents or to minimize the amount of radioactivity released to the environment have been adopted, however human error remains, and [...] "there have been many accidents with varying impacts as well near misses and incidents". As of 2014, there have been more than 100 serious nuclear accidents and incidents from the use of nuclear power. Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and about 60% of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the USA. Serious nuclear power plant accidents include the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), Chernobyl disaster (1986), Three Mile Island accident (1979), and the SL-1 accident (1961). Nuclear power accidents can involve loss of life and large monetary costs for remediation work.|$|E
