5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued <b>to</b> <b>fall.</b> Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|Converge {{began writing}} Axe <b>to</b> <b>Fall</b> in November 2008. With Jacob Bannon, Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within {{a half a}} mile {{of each other in}} Boston, and Ben Koller living a couple hours away in Brooklyn, Converge could easily {{practice}} for weeks at a time. Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe <b>to</b> <b>Fall,</b> but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
