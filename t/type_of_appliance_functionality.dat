50|$|A {{key part}} <b>of</b> <b>appliance</b> {{recycling}} is the manual dismantling of each product. The disassembly removes hazardous components, while sorting out reusable parts. Procedures vary from one appliance to the other. The amount of hazardous components {{able to be}} removed also depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>appliance.</b> Low removal rates of hazardous components reduce the recyclability of valuable materials. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>appliance</b> has {{its own set of}} characteristics and components. This makes characterization <b>of</b> <b>appliances</b> essential to sorting and separating parts. Research on appliance dismantling has become an active area, intending to help recycling reach maximum efficiency.|$|R
