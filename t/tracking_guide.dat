40|$|The NASA Space Telescope (ST) is a 2. 4 -m aperture, f/ 24 Ritchey-Chretien {{telescope}} {{coupled to}} five on-board astronomical scientific packages. The very accurate line-of-sight stability required by ST during operating periods {{of up to}} 24 hours is maintained by the Pointing Control System whose optical system, the Fine Guidance Subsystem (FGS), is described. The Pointing Control System includes three identical FGSs, any two of which provide line-of-sight stabilization by <b>tracking</b> <b>guide</b> stars while the third performs astrometry. The optical system for the ST FGS performs the field aberration correction within the FGS near a pupil plane measuring only 52. 7 mm.

40|$|Automatic <b>track</b> <b>guiding</b> of {{vehicles}} is of increasing interest for Intelligent Vehicle/ Highway Systems [1 [...] 3]. <b>Track</b> <b>guided</b> vehicles {{are used in}} automated production facilities, ship docks, and for city busses which drive in special narrow lanes. The primary task of such a system is to follow a path as well as possible. <b>Track</b> <b>guiding</b> systems have been designed for various controller structures [4 [...] 8]. In the present paper it will be shown how to follow a given path error-free under some idealistic assumptions by feedforward of the estimated curvature of the reference path. For practical use this concept is not directly applicable, mainly due to unknown plant parameters and limited actuator force. However, a modified control concept based on this result yields good performance under realistic conditions. 1 Model of the Steering Dynamics The 2 -wheel single-track model by Riekert-Schunck [9] is used to obtain a mathematical description of the vehicle dynamics.

50|$|The first {{prototype}} to {{be ready}} was that of Renault, that also had received orders for six sets. It was tested between 15 and 23 April 1930. Certain defects were found and remedied, after which the prototype was again tested from 3 June. A second prototype, fitted with a rubber track, was tested between 28 April and 12 May. This other track type was shown to be too weak. The project had as factory designation Renault UE, a chronological letter code without further meaning; the smaller trailer was the Renault UK. The Vickers suspension with double <b>track</b> <b>guides</b> was imitated. For Renault this new suspension type, that he patented despite its obvious Vickers ancestry, offered the solution for severe problems he had experienced trying to adapt his existing suspension models, using single <b>track</b> <b>guides,</b> to a high velocity vehicle without increasing the chance that the track would be thrown at higher speeds. Renault hoped to further develop the UE into a light tank by adding a turret; accordingly the hull resembled a tank chassis rather than a dedicated supply vehicle.|$|R
