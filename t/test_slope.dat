This is followed by the design of a parabolic-trough solar-collector system, due consideration having been given to collector-aperture and rim-angle optimisation, together with the receiver-diameter selection. The collector characteristic curve gives a <b>test</b> <b>slope</b> of 0 Â· 441 and a test intercept equal to 0 Â· 642. The value of the <b>test</b> <b>slope</b> differs considerably from the initially predicted value: this is attributed to the heat losses from the receiver support brackets.

We tested {{the hypothesis that}} endurance tests induce a near-maximal physiological demand comparable to incremental tests. We also hypothesized that differences in respiratory response during exercise would {{be related to the}} characteristics of the exercise tests. METHODS: Within two weeks, twenty-one PAH patients (mean age: 54 (15) years; mean pulmonary arterial pressure: 42 (12) mmHg) completed two cycling exercise tests (incremental cardiopulmonary cycling exercise test (CPET) and CET) and three field tests (ISWT, ESWT and six-minute walk test (6 MWT)). Physiological parameters were continuously monitored using the same portable telemetric device. RESULTS: Peak oxygen consumption (VO(2 peak)) was similar amongst the five exercise tests (p = 0. 90 by ANOVA). Walking distance correlated markedly with the VO(2 peak) reached during field tests, especially when weight was taken into account. At 100 % exercise, most physiological parameters were similar between incremental and endurance tests. However, the trends overtime differed. In the incremental <b>tests,</b> <b>slopes</b> for these parameters rose steadily over the entire duration of the tests, whereas in the endurance <b>tests,</b> <b>slopes</b> rose sharply from baseline to 25 % of maximum exercise at which point they appeared far less steep until test end. Moreover, cycling exercise tests induced higher respiratory exchange ratio, ventilatory demand and enhanced leg fatigue measured subjectively and objectively. CONCLUSION: Endurance tests induce a maximal physiological demand in PAH. Differences in peak respiratory response during exercise are related to the modality (cycling vs. walking) rather than the progression (endurance vs. incremental) of the exercise tests...|$|R

The gradient of the track was measured and utilized by the sensor system to correct measurement errors. A mathematical model, developed by Apertus AS (Asker, Norway) was used to estimate the snow friction coefficient based on the acceleration loss. The results from the IMU sensor provided more information, including peak acceleration, maximum speed, time required to reach maximum speed, and speed loss, which can easily be seen. The use of IMU sensors in gliding tests may prove useful to differ between skis (Δμ ∼ 0. 01).

Under non-normal errors {{and in the case of}} stationary dynamic models, the condition on the relative expansion rates of N and T for the test to be valid is given by √ N /T → 0, as (N, T) → j ∞.

This project, conducted in southwest Montana, aimed to verify past findings and further {{develop an understanding}} of snow explosive interactions, particularly for hard slab conditions. Past re-search collected dynamic snow responses 10 - 100 m from the detonation site while the current study placed an instrumentation suite within 3 - 5 m of the detonation. Pentolite cast boosters (0. 9 kg) were deto-nated from 0. 0 m to 2. 0 m above the hard slab snow surface. An array of six orthogonally paired accel-erometers, inserted into the snowpack at three different depths at two locations from the blast, recorded snow accelerations. High pressure sensors, located at and above the snow surface, measured air over-pressures. Distances, radial and horizontal, from the explosives and charge height were scaled to TNT equivalents to aid in explosive placement comparisons. A substantial advantage was recorded in maxi-mum snow accelerations due to elevating the explosive. Vertical and radial attenuation functions within the snowpack were determined from accelerometer data. Using the attention functions, predictions for depth and range of affected snow were developed. While the depth of affected snow did not increase substantially with a raised explosive, the range did show significant increases yielding an 80 - 100 % in-crease in the volume of snow impacted by the explosive. The data also demonstrated that there was vir-tually no penalty in shockwave attenuation from raising the explosive...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} a {{particular}} aspect of feature extraction from LiDAR data. To support transportation flow data estimation, points reflected back from vehicles should be extracted from a LiDAR cloud. A simple thresholding can certainly provide {{a good starting point}} to solve this task, but in order to achieve a robust solution there are several other tasks that should be addressed. First, the road itself should be identified (actually continuously followed) to define the search window for the vehicles. Then, the surface of the road must be modeled to obtain true elevation of the vehicle (which is measured in the normal direction of the surface). Once the LiDAR points representing a vehicle have been obtained, at minimum the vehicle orientation should be determined such as travel direction. This paper introduces a technique to accomplish the above mentioned tasks. The road is followed by the guidance of an initial coarse centerline description. Then a preprocessing phase takes place, the point cloud is segmented to get the vehicle blobs. The segmentation is based on standard image processing methods, such as histogram thresholding or edge detection techniques, both methods are currently under consideration. In the next step, vehicle outlines are created using statistical parameters, such as standard deviation of height values or height "texture " measures. The robustness of the process has been improved by using Delaunaytriangulation to <b>test</b> <b>slope</b> measures. The newly developed method has been implemented in Matlab environment and provides visualization tools for diagnostic purposes.

The goal of this project is to perform genomic evaluations of sires based on a joint analysis of all the genotypes collected around Europe. To date, six countries are involved in Intergenomics {{and according to the}} country, between 3 and 15 traits are available. In this study, we propose to compare a panel of 4 genomic selection approaches to the pedigree-based BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Predictor). Among these 4 methodologies, performances of the genomic BLUP (GBLUP) were compared to 2 bayesian approaches (Bayesian LASSO and Bayes Cπ) and a variable selection approach (Elastic Net or EN). Except the GBLUP, the other genomic selection approaches deal with the p>>n problem (number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism or SNP (p) is much higher than the number of bulls (n)). We compare the correlations between observed and predicted deregressed proofs for the different traits, the different country scales and the different methods.

40|$|Abstract- It {{is known}} that snow {{metamorphism}} is initially. en by the tendency of individual snow grains toward~ 1 ~roum surface area (Kuroiwa, 1976). Dendritic arms andro 1 ~~r surface protrusions disappear as material is transferred ~ diffusion to either free crystal faces or to bonds between y stals. This type of metamorphism produces a volumetricC~traction of the layer (Kojima, 1967; Nakamura and Kenmotsu,~ 97 l). The contraction may be apparent in laboratory uniaxial tests. For example, Shinojima (1967) performed slow uniaxial tests on snow in compression and tension. He found that poisson's ratio (ratio of lateral deformation to axial deformation) was approximately zero in compressive tests, and approximately 0. 5 in tension tests. This behaviour {{can be explained by}} assuming that snow contraction is significant when samples are loaded at slow rates. Contraction will cause added stress or surface tension in amounts that depend on geometry and boundary conditions. Some of the effects of surface tension are manifested by snow pressures against trees or posts (Takahashi, 1968). With respect to slab avalanche development, the critical stress field may be a result of contractions that occur at localized regions of the slope. The resulting surface tensions may cause fracturing and, hence, slab avalanche release. In stUdies of snow slope deformation (Nakamata, 1962; Sato and Ishikawa, 1971), {{it was found that the}} rate of contraction increased prior to the formation of cracks. Of course, it should be understood that contraction is not the sole cause of slab avalanche release, and that avalanche instability correlates statistically with such factors as rate of snowfall and wind (Bojo et al., 1973). The author has developed a new method for measuring snow slope contraction.

40|$|Stability of rock on {{horizontal}} bottoms {{and steep}} slopes subjected to wave attack {{has been a}} subject of investigation in the past. But the stability of rock on gentle slopes has not been investigated systematically. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the relations between the different variables involved. A possible application is the protection of outfall structures. Due to the lack of information on this subject, relations derived for stability of rock on horizontal bottoms subjected to wave attack were applied. Application of these theories imply a destabilization of the rock by orbital velocities causing shear stresses at the bottom. Orbital velocities were calculated along the profile of the structure with the linear wave theory and substituted in the stability relations for horizontal bottoms according to the theories of Ranee & Warren and Jonsson / Sleath, respectively. The results of the calculations were expressed in the stability variable H/ADn 5 0 versus the relative waterdepth, h/H. This was done for regular as well as for irregular waves. The calculations showed an increase in the stability for increasing values of the wave steepness. Also, the deeper the water the higher the stability values. Experiments were conducted in the large wave flume of the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics at the Delft University of Technology. The model consisted of an impermeable 1 : 25 slope, on which several materials were tested. Regular and irregular waves were applied and for various conditions the wave heights and bottom velocities along the <b>test</b> <b>slope</b> were measured. The experimental results were compared with the calculations. For regular waves it appeared that for h/H values larger than one the calculations describe the stability of the rock quite well. For h/H values smaller than one the calculations are not adequate to describe the stability of the rock. The location of maximum attack was around h/H = 1. For irregular waves the location of attack was not that clear. The damage was not as concentrated and more spread out. The location of maximum attack was around h/Hs = 1. For both regular as irregular waves the general tendency could be described by the calculations but the 'plunging' effect o f the more curl-shaped waves with lower values of the wave steepness resulted into a more severe attack on the structure. For irregular waves more experiments have to be conducted for the slope section where waves are not yet broken. This to confirm or reject the theories derived applied to horizontal bottoms for the stability of rock on gentle slopes attacked by irregular waves. To investigate whether the computer simulation ODIFLOCS, can be used to simulate wave motion on gentle slopes, a comparison was made with the measurements in the experimental model. ODIFLOCS proved not to be suitable for simulation of wave motion on gentle slopes, mainly due to short comings of the numerical scheme used by ODIFLOCS which was developed for 'short' steep slopes.

A significant linear relationship (r = 0. 811) correlation between the dust weight and near-infrared band region (700 - 1000 nm) was found through analysis of the spectral data. This relationship obtained from near-infrared band regions, based on the main effects and cluster and interval analysis, was more distinct and stable than that of blue, green, red, and middle-infrared band regions. Thus, the use of near-infrared band data is a reliable method to estimate the amount of dust deposition on plant leaves. A regression model (R 2 = 64. 3 %) was constructed based on dust deposition on plant leaves and a near-infrared ratio. The model proved to be accurate as regards an estimation of dust weight, based on a comparison of residuals (normal distribution) and accuracy <b>tests</b> (<b>slope</b> = 0. 8437). This model could provide a methodological basis for spatial dust distribution analysis and has the potential for evaluating air pollution levels.

40|$|The {{switch from}} {{shifting}} cultivation to more permanent highland cropping systems in northern Thailand {{led to an}} increase in soil tillage intensity. In order to quantify soil losses by tillage erosion, a tillage experiment was set up and an on-farm survey was conducted. Soil fluxes due to manual tillage on five slopes (32 - 82 %) were measured by monitoring tracers, by measuring tillage step characteristics and by collecting soil material in a trench. The trench method yielded soil flux values that were significantly smaller than those obtained by the tracer or the step method. Soil fluxes resulting from one manual tillage pass ranged between 39 and 87 kg/m on the <b>tested</b> <b>slopes.</b> On slopes up to 60 %, {{there were no significant differences}} in soil fluxes. However, on slopes steeper than 70 %, soil fluxes increased significantly because the angle of repose for soil clods was exceeded. The soil fluxes are used to construct a nomogram for estimating soil loss rates resulting from manual tillage erosion as a function of slope and plot length. Rates on a typical upland field (slope 30 %- 50 %, slope length 30 - 50 m) range from 8 to 18 t/ha. tillage pass, so tilage erosion is a significant contributor to the total soil loss. It dominates on short fields and fields with buffer-strips, whereas water erosion is the more important form of soil loss on middle size and long fields. Increasing land pressure will result in increasing tillage erosion rates, and these need to be considered when assessing soil degradation rates or when studying hillslope evolution.

40|$|Adapting to blurred or {{sharpened}} images alters perceived blur of {{a focused}} image (M. A. Webster, M. A. Georgeson, & S. M. Webster, 2002). We asked whether blur adaptation results in (a) renormalization of perceived focus or (b) a repulsion aftereffect. Images were checkerboards or 2 -D Gaussian noise, whose amplitude spectra had (log-log) slopes from - 2 (strongly blurred) to 0 (strongly sharpened). Observers adjusted the spectral slope of a comparison image to match different <b>test</b> <b>slopes</b> after adaptation to blurred or sharpened images. Results {{did not show}} repulsion effects but were consistent with some renormalization. Test blur levels at and near a blurred or sharpened adaptation level were matched by more focused slopes (closer to 1 /f) but {{with little or no}} change in appearance after adaptation to focused (1 /f) images. A model of contrast adaptation and blur coding by multiple-scale spatial filters predicts these blur aftereffects and those of Webster et al. (2002). A key proposal is that observers are pre-adapted to natural spectra, and blurred or sharpened spectra induce changes in the state of adaptation. The model illustrates how norms might be encoded and recalibrated in the visual system even when they are represented only implicitly by the distribution of responses across multiple channels...|$|R
