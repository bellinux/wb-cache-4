500|$|Walker is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that utilises 2D computer graphics. The player controls a bipedal mech to advance through the game's four stages, each {{consisting of two}} levels: 1944 Berlin, 2019 Los Angeles, contemporary Middle East, and 2420 Earth during [...] "The Great War". Throughout the levels, the player uses the mech's machine guns to defeat waves of enemy infantry, tanks, and airships; the player advances {{to the next level}} upon killing all enemies. When the mech's guns are fired, the <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> rises; when overheated, the guns must cool down over a short time before further use. The player has the ability to lock-on to enemies with their missiles. The mech's shield acts as the player's health and is depleted when enemies attack the mech. When the mech is destroyed, the player loses a life; when all three lives are lost, the game ends. At the end of each level, the player must defeat a boss. Unlike most side-scrolling games, Walker is controlled from right to left. The game features two difficulty levels: easy and arcade. [...] Only the first two stages are playable in easy mode.|$|E

Also the precipitation forms a separate chapter, while other elements are all summarized in one chapter, because there are not that many studies about them. The average annual temperature and precipitation trends calculated for Europe or the world were similar to those in Central Europe. As for the <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators,</b> during the 2 nd half of the 20 th century warming was found in most cases and insignificant trends prevailed for precipitation indicators. Among the seasonal changes in climate, autumn stood out. Its trends were in some cases (especially for <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators)</b> different from the other seasons.

40|$|Summary. For the {{description}} of the processes occurring in internal combustion engine and elements of transmission, various mathematical models are used. In work the section of mathematical statistics - experiment planning is applied. For an estimation of influence of external influences on <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> of oils ICE and transmission elements full factorial experiment which is directed on definition of temperature of oil ICE, a transmission and the main transfers has been realized. Modeling of influence of external influences on <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> of oils ICE and transmission elements consisted in the following: the conceptual model was under construction; its formalization and research of modeled process was spent; necessary approximations were defined; the generalised scheme of process was under construction; under this generalized scheme the algorithm was created and the program complex was developed; calculations on the computer were spent; mathematical and graphic dependences of external influences on <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> of oils ICE and transmission elements were defined; practical recommendations about heating process with reference to operational conditions of SNO OP were developed. Object of research is the air temperature, an operating time of system of heating and capacity of the thermal unit, influencing temperature of oils ICE, transmissions, the main transfers the MAT. The problem is reduced to definition of such capacity of the thermal unit at which the maximum value of temperature of oil for the minimum time is reached. Full factorial experiment FFE allowing is planned to define interaction of two factors which is shown at a simultaneous variation of these factors at action of each of them on an exit depending on level of their finding...|$|R
