5|$|McKinsey & Company has {{traditionally}} charged approximately 25 {{percent more than}} competing firms with an average project of one million dollars. Prices were reduced in the economic slump following <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bubble. According to The Globe and Mail, McKinsey clients estimate that the firm's advice {{turns out to be}} poor in retrospect about 10 to 20 percent of the time.|$|E
5|$|The company {{considered}} making 25 {{percent of}} the company available on the stock market and providing employees with stock-options during <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bubble before the following downturn, but ultimately chose not to.

5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> boom, stable {{monetary}} policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001. Beginning in 1994, the U.S. {{entered into the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.|$|E

In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China. Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown and revenues fell by two-thirds during <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bust. 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Chuck Sheetz and written by John Swartzwelder. The idea for the episode was pitched by Matt Selman, and the staff took inspiration for the episode from the Simpsons staff's own experience with web cartoons, such as Queer Duck and Hard Drinkin' Lincoln. The episode includes references to <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bubble, Danish physicist Niels Bohr and comic book publishers Marvel Comics and DC Comics. It also features American comic book writer Stan Lee as himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{staff at}} Bomis was {{originally}} about five employees. Its 2000 staff included programmer Toan Vo and system administrator Jason Richey; Wales employed his high-school friend and best {{man in his}} second wedding, Terry Foote, as advertising director. In June 2000, Bomis was one of five network partners of Ask Jeeves. The majority of the revenue that came in to Bomis was generated through advertising. The most successful time for Bomis was during its venture {{as a member of}} the NBC web portal NBCi; this collapsed at the end of <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bubble.|$|E
5|$|Bomis created Nupedia {{as a free}} online {{encyclopedia}} (with content {{submitted by}} experts) {{but it had a}} tedious, slow review process. Wikipedia was initially launched by Bomis to provide content for Nupedia, and was a for-profit venture (a Bomis subsidiary) through the end of 2002. As the costs of Wikipedia rose with its popularity, Bomis' revenues declined as result of <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> crash. Since Wikipedia was a drain on Bomis' resources, Wales and philosophy graduate student Larry Sanger decided to fund the project as a charity; Sanger was laid off from Bomis in 2002. Nupedia content was merged into Wikipedia, and it ceased in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{took office}} {{during a period}} of {{economic}} recession {{in the wake of the}} bursting of <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bubble. The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14percent, corporate tax revenues by 50percent, customs and duties by 40percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62percent, Medicare spending by 131percent, social security by 51percent, and income security spending by 130percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35percent and spending by 65percent.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during {{the crash of}} the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he compared it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during <b>the</b> <b>Dot-com</b> bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of <b>the</b> <b>Dot-com</b> bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, in {{the middle}} of the World Series match between two Bay Area {{baseball}} teams, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck and caused widespread infrastructural damage, including the failure of the Bay Bridge, a major link between San Francisco and Oakland. Even so, the Bay Area's technology industry continued to expand and growth in Silicon Valley accelerated that the United States Census confirmed that year that San Jose had overtaken San Francisco in terms of population. The commercialization of the Internet {{in the middle}} of the decade rapidly created a speculative bubble in the high-tech economy known as <b>the</b> <b>Dot-com</b> bubble. This bubble began collapsing in the early 2000s and the industry continued contracting for the next few years, nearly wiping out the market. Companies like Amazon.com and Google managed to weather the crash however, and following the industry's return to normalcy, their market value increased significantly.|$|E

Some would argue that this is happening with precious little thought for the environment or society at large, yet others say it has real potential to benefit both. Over the past year, Forum for the Future's Digital Futures project has examined the sustainability opportunities of e-business and the project's findings are summarised in this article...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, {{his wealth}} briefly surpassed $101billion. Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E

25|$|Then, <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> {{boom that}} had been fueling California's record tax {{revenues}} burst unexpectedly {{because of the large}} number of high tech firms in California and California's dependence on state income taxes. When <b>the</b> <b>dot-com</b> boom turned to bust, state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits. Restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the state's credit rating became unpopular. The beginning shortfall for the 2002-2003 state budget was $23.6 billion. Davis announced that the 2003-2004 budget shortfall would be $34.6 billion while the Legislative Analyst projected a $21.1.|$|E
