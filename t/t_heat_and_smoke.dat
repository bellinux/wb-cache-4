5000|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>Smoke</b> Vents are {{installed}} in buildings {{as an active}} fire protection measure. They are openings in the roof which are intended to vent the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> developed by a fire inside the building {{by the action of}} buoyancy, such that they are known as [...] "gravity vents".|$|R
50|$|During {{locomotive}} running, unburnt {{pieces of}} coal, ash and cinders {{lodged in the}} <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> tubes, which therefore had to be cleaned out at specified intervals. Usually, this process took place every 500 to 1,000 kilometres. The tube cleaning equipment consisted of a mobile work platform and a compressed air pipe to blow through the <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> tubes. For this activity, an employee (the tube cleaner) carried out this job on a designated siding. Cleaning all the tubes could take about an hour. A DR Class 01.5, for example, had 168 <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> tubes.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of guidance available for design of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> building vents installed in buildings {{is restricted to}} nonsprinklered, single-story buildings. This is partly a historical consequence of the installation of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> vents following the August 1953 General Motors, Livonia, MI major fire in a nonsprinklered manufacturing facility which effectively stopped the production of automatic transmissions for all of GM. Vents were also installed in storage buildings prior to the installation of fire sprinklers as a widespread warehousing industry practice. Subsequent to sprinklers being installed in storage buildings as a widespread practice, {{there has been a}} lack of consensus regarding the nature of the interaction of sprinklers <b>and</b> automatic <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> vents. This lack of consensus continues to this day.|$|R
5000|$|Initiating devices: These {{components}} act {{as inputs}} {{to the fire}} alarm control unit and are either manually or automatically activated. Examples would be devices such as pull stations, <b>heat</b> detectors, <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detectors. <b>Heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detectors have different categories of both kinds. Some categories are beam, photoelectric, ionization, aspiration, and duct.|$|R

40|$|Fire is an {{integral}} component of many ecosystems worldwide. Many plant species require fire-related cues, primarily <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke,</b> to trigger germination. Despite {{the importance of this}} process, the responses of many Australian species to these cues are unknown. Without this knowledge fire management strategies may be developed that are inappropriate for individual species and vegetation communities. In this study we examined the responses of a dry sclerophyll forest seed bank to <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> germination cues. Analysis was possible for 48 taxa within the soil seedbank with 34 of these showing a response to {{one or both of the}} germination cues. 10 species responded to the heat treatment, 11 species responded to the <b>smoke</b> treatment <b>and</b> 13 species responded to both the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> treatments. Germination cues acted independently for all species considered. Results in this study were consistent with published reports for most species, although some differences were seen at the species and genus level. The study highlights the importance of fire-related cues in enhancing germination of a large proportion of the species occurring in dry sclerophyll forests...|$|R
5000|$|Backdrafts {{are very}} dangerous, often {{surprising}} even experienced firefighters. The most common tactic used by firefighters to defuse a potential backdraft is to ventilate a room from its highest point, allowing the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> to escape without igniting.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{there are}} two types of ventilation; {{vertical}} and horizontal. Their names refer to the general locations of the intended exit points of the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> to be ventilated. Vertical ventilation takes place through holes cut in the roof, typically by truck companies during the early stages of a fire in a process known collectively as roof operations, while horizontal ventilation usually takes place through doors and windows. The goal of each is to clear <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> to increase chances of survival for trapped occupants, and/or so that water lines can be advanced into the structure, to more effectively battle the flames. While their goals are similar, their applications are different, but still both require good timing and coordination so that increased air flow through a structure doesn't contribute to fire spread.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between fire-related cues (<b>heat</b> shock <b>and</b> <b>smoke)</b> <b>and</b> the germination behaviour of Cistus creticus (Cistaceae) seeds under laboratory conditions. The seeds were obtained from a long-unburned Pinus brutia Ten. forest located on the Bozburun peninsula, Muðla, Turkey. Heat treatments were carried out at 80, 100, 120, and 150 °C for five minutes. For smoke treatments, seeds were incubated in a liquid smoke solution for 24 hours. Both dry and watered controls {{were included in the}} experiment for <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> treatments, respectively. Extra treatments of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> combinations <b>and</b> a cold stratification treatment were also performed. The treated and untreated seeds were sown into Petri dishes containing agar as a substrate, and the germinations were monitored {{until the end of the}} experiment. When compared with the control, the heat shock of 100, 120 and 150 °C had significant stimulatory effects on the germination response, whereas 80 °C, <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> cold stratification did not. The results of the heat treatments are in accordance with current literature, but there is still a need for more studies for the comparison of the smoke treatment. In summary, the results indicated that seed germination of the considered population of C. creticus is stimulated by moderate <b>and</b> high <b>heat</b> intensities, but not by low <b>heat</b> intensity <b>and</b> <b>smoke.</b> It is important to know the germination response of plant species to fire cues for better management decisions in fire-prone woodland ecosystems...|$|R
