5|$|On October27, 1934, the Meadowbrook and Lido Beach Loop causeways {{were opened}} to {{vehicular}} traffic by LISPC. A motorcade of cars was led across the new roadways by Robert Moses, then a Republican Party candidate for Governor of New York. The event {{was preceded by}} parades in Freeport and Rockville Centre. During a speech Moses cited praises to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for donating the money and letting the LISPC and Jones Beach State Parkway Authority do the work without interference. Other speakers that afternoon praised Moses and the LISPC, and New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia showed up late to give his congratulations. Despite the opening ceremony, <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> was not permitted on the Meadowbrook between the Southern State and Merrick Road until June1, 1935. Prior to that time, motorists {{had to use the}} renamed Wantagh Causeway to access Jones Beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} SR 266 {{from the western}} {{terminus}} to the junction with SR 168 is designated by the California State Legislature as eligible by law for the State Scenic Highway System; {{but it is not}} officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The entire route, consisting of two lanes for <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic,</b> traverses on the flat land in the Fish Lake Valley east of the White Mountains, and it can serve as transportation of agricultural goods between California and Nevada via the route's only junction State Route 168. In the event that SR 168 is closed, SR 266 connects to Nevada State Route 264, which intersects with U.S. Route 6 in order to provide an alternate access to California.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic.</b> Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E

25|$|A Danish road {{directorate}} {{states that}} in town centres {{it is important}} to be able to cycle in both directions in all streets, and that in certain circumstances, <b>two-way</b> cycle <b>traffic</b> can be accommodated in an otherwise one-way street.|$|R
25|$|Following the split, Eleventh Avenue is <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> {{for access}} to 23rd Street, {{as well as for}} 24th Street to access Chelsea Piers. North of 24th Street, Eleventh Avenue is one-way {{southbound}} from 24th to 44th Streets, where <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> resumes. Formerly, there was <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> between 34th Street and 40th Street {{for access to}} the Lincoln Tunnel, but recent construction has made that segment of Eleventh Avenue southbound-only, except for the block above 39th Street. The segment between approximately 39th and 59th Streets is home to the largest concentration of auto dealerships in Manhattan. <b>Two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> resumes at 44th Street.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, {{city council}} {{approved}} converting one-way arteries {{through the city}} centre to allow for <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{to make it easier}} for people to make their way around the city to explore it. In terms of urban planning and use, <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> improves circulation within the area. The city wanted to improve downtown as a destination, rather than a place to pass through. The council also want to have downtown St. Catharines on the Wine Route, a driving tour of Niagara wineries and an Ontario Wine Council initiative to boost the number of visitors to the region's many wineries. The Wine Route was modified to officially redirect winery goers through the downtown starting in 2012. The first phase of <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> was completed in 2009, with St. Paul and King streets being converted. The cost of the conversion was $3.5million and was shared with Niagara Region. In 2012, most observers concluded that the change had achieved its goals; it garnered national media attention.|$|E
50|$|The bridge now carries {{across the}} river not only <b>two-way</b> road <b>traffic,</b> but also a lane for car parking, a wide cycling & {{pedestrian}} pavement {{on one side of}} the carriageway, and a pedestrian pavement on the other side.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are often}} {{restrictions}} to what one-way streets are good candidates for allowing <b>two-way</b> cycling <b>traffic.</b> In Belgium road authorities can in principle allow any one-way streets in [...] zones to be two-way for cyclists if the available lane {{is at least}} [...] wide (area free from parking) and no specific local circumstances prevent it.|$|R
50|$|The {{aggregator}} model {{involves the}} mobile messaging operator signing multiple individual agreements with mobile operators to facilitate <b>two-way</b> SMS <b>traffic</b> through that operator’s SMSC (Short Message Service Center).

25|$|In 1980, District {{officials}} spent $8.5 million {{reconstructing the}} deck of the bridge. The bridge was carrying about 56,000 vehicles a day at that time. One side of the span was closed at a time, with <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> proceeding on the open portion.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} suspension span carries northbound traffic for Interstate 295, {{whereas the}} newer span carries the southbound traffic.

25|$|Since {{the canal}} does not cater to {{unregulated}} <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic,</b> all ships transit in convoys on regular times, scheduled on a 24-hour basis. Each day, a single northbound convoy starts at 04:00 from Suez. At dulka lane sections, the convoy uses the eastern route. Synchronised with this convoy's passage is the southbound convoy. It starts at 03:30 from Port Said and so passes the Northbound convoy in the two-lane section.|$|E
50|$|Installation of {{receivers}} and transmitters at {{the same}} fixed location allowed exchange of messages wirelessly. As early as 1907, <b>two-way</b> telegraphy <b>traffic</b> across the Atlantic Ocean was commercially available.

25|$|The express tracks' {{section on}} this block {{was allowed to}} {{deteriorate}} severely as did much of the system from the 1970s on. In 1998, {{it was decided to}} rehabilitate the express tracks in this area, with full signaling. Only the northbound (E4) track was rehabilitated, however, for <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> from its northern end to Kings Highway if needed. The southbound (E3) track remains unused, being disconnected from the other three tracks and inaccessible from 59th Street to Kings Highway.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{pedestrian}} facilities on the bridge, the Bay Bridge Walk and Governor's Bay Bridge Run used to afford an opportunity to cross the bridge on foot, usually on the first Sunday in May. The events {{took place on the}} eastbound span, which was closed to vehicles while <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> shared the westbound span. Participants started on the east end of the bridge (on Kent Island) and proceeded west to the finish near the toll plaza. WMATA and MTA transit buses transported participants between outlying parking areas and the start and finish points.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{continues}} to be an important crossing point over the river, linking the centre of Ludlow with Ludford and places to the south and southwest of the town, including the town's livestock market. Until the opening of the Ludlow by-pass in 1979, the A49 road used the bridge (the B4361 through Ludlow and Ludford was then the A49). Vehicular traffic over the bridge is restricted to one direction at a time, and the <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> of the road is controlled by traffic lights on both sides. Pedestrian refuges exist above the cutwaters between the arches.|$|E

25|$|The fitting and {{calibration}} of gauging plates {{was done}} at a gauging station or indexing station. On the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) Main Line the Smethwick Gauging Station near the Engine Arm Aqueduct was on an island, with a covered gantry in a centre channel where boats were loaded with weights, plated and calibrated. The channels either side allowed <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> and possibly the collection of tolls. The buildings and equipment were demolished in the 1940s. Another BCN indexing station at Tipton survives. Here iron weights were loaded, four tons at a time. Other canal companies had stations at Etruria on the Trent and Mersey Canal and Northwich on the Weaver.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} Bridge Street between Milton Avenue in Solvay and State Fair Boulevard in Geddes {{had been a}} state highway since 1917; however, it was not {{assigned}} a signed designation for roughly 40 years. In the late 1950s, Bridge Street {{became part of the}} new NY297, a highway beginning at NY173 in Fairmount and ending at State Fair Boulevard (then part of NY48). The bridge carrying NY297 (Bridge Street) over the CSX Transportation-owned Mohawk Subdivision in Geddes was replaced in 1977. Portions of the bridge deck and abutments were rehabilitated by NYSDOT in 2006. Only one lane was open to traffic during the summer-long project; however, <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic</b> was maintained through the use of temporary traffic signals.|$|E
25|$|The {{second section}} of NY153 from NY31F to Commercial Street was entirely rebuilt. As {{part of the}} project, new sidewalks, curbing, and {{drainage}} systems were constructed along the roadway. During the course of construction, only one direction of traffic was allowed on the road. NY153 northbound was closed first; travelers heading north were instructed to follow NY31F, Lincoln Road and Linden Avenue to traverse the village. Construction paused in November 2007 for the winter months, at which time the highway was reopened to <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic.</b> On March31, 2008, NY153 northbound was closed again and the detour was reinstated; however, the detour now utilized NY31F, the service roads of I-490 between exits24 and25, and West Commercial Street instead. From May26 to June28, both directions of NY153 between NY31F and Commercial Street were closed to traffic {{to allow for a}} larger scale of construction. The project was completed in October 2008.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea was}} to bore a pilot tunnel or 'driftway' {{starting}} from a shaft to be sunk in Rotherhithe (i.e. from the south bank). The driftway was supposed to drain the surrounding bedrock and then be enlarged into a full, brick-arched tunnel which would accommodate <b>two-way</b> vehicular <b>traffic.</b> Unfortunately the firm strata anticipated were mostly sand and gravel with pockets of quicksand. After a year Vazie had only driven a shaft 12.8 m deep and money was running out.|$|R
5000|$|The Main {{shipping}} channel (新港主航道) is 39.5 km long. The channel {{extends from}} the gate line of the VTS control area (20 nautical miles (37 km) from the VTS control tower), up {{to the start of}} the Chuanzhadong Channel. Since November 2010, the Main Channel has been dredged to a depth of −19.5 m and a bottom width of 420 m, making it capable of handling <b>two-way</b> 250,000 DWT <b>traffic,</b> and to accept 300,000 DWT ships at high tide. There are two service channels (100 m wide and 9 m deep) at each side of the main channel, which allow ships under 10,000 DWT (i.e. service craft, barges and coastal ships) to transit without interference from the big ships. The breakwater mouth was expanded to 1,100 m wide in 2010. As of 2012, the Main Channel is being deepened to 22 m and widened to 765 m, which will allow <b>two-way</b> all-tide <b>traffic</b> of 300,000 DWT ships by 2013.|$|R
25|$|Construction on {{the first}} 1.5-mile (2.5km) section, from Canal Street to 22nd Street, was started on May 24, 1929, and the road was officially opened on November 13, 1930, with some inaugural {{vehicles}} using the highway as early as October 28. Traffic was not permitted on the structure until November 17 due to unanticipated delays in cosmetic work. A speed limit of 35 miles per hour (55km/h) was set by Police Commissioner Edward Mulrooney, and trucks were temporarily banned. On the first Sunday the road was in operation, the northbound roadway was backed up for a mile approaching the north end at 23rd Street. The northbound offramp at 23rd Street, unlike the temporary southbound onramp, was built as a permanent single lane ramp, since in the future most traffic would continue along the not-yet-finished elevated highway. Suggested fixes included a new temporary ramp to 25th Street and conversion of the temporary southbound onramp to <b>two-way</b> <b>traffic.</b> The second Sunday the road was open, rain {{cut down on the}} traffic, but police had orders to open the permanent ramp eventually intended for a northbound onramp to exiting northbound traffic if traffic conditions warranted.|$|E
