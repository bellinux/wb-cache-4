Last year we didn't come close to our potential so we had no chance. Of course it's a big game like it was last year, two ranked teams, so there's a lot of people watching it to see what's going on.

Having gone through, ourselves, what appeared to be an interference, or at least an aggravation, on the artistic side by record companies, we wanted to form a label where the artists would be able to fulfill themselves without all of that hassle.

25|$|For many {{classical}} philosophers, {{nature was}} understood teleologically, meaning <b>that</b> every <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even {{said to have}} reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal {{part of the human}} mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (psyche), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (thumos) and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.|$|R
500|$|Within {{the various}} {{uses of the}} word today, [...] "nature" [...] often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, {{and in some cases}} to the {{processes}} associated with inanimate objects–the way <b>that</b> particular <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the [...] "natural environment" [...] or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, [...] "human nature" [...] or [...] "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept <b>of</b> natural <b>things</b> which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term [...] "natural" [...] might also be distinguished from the [...] or the supernatural.|$|R

[...] In January 2008, Romanek left the project because of creative differences. Brett Ratner emerged as a frontrunner to replace Romanek, but the studio also met with Frank Darabont, James Mangold and Joe Johnston. They were also interested in Bill Condon, and Martin Campbell was interested. Johnston was hired to direct on 3 February 2008, and the film's shooting schedule and budget remained as intended. Johnston hired David Self to rewrite the script.|$|E

Savile helped promote the band in his column for The People but Them earned a {{reputation}} for bad manners and sarcasm in their interviews.

Phil Coulter recalled the band's interview with a female reporter: [...] "They would just sit and mutter monosyllabic grunts to themselves and give her off-the-wall answers". (Morrison as a solo artist raised such interviews to a [...] "negative art form"). Their management promoted Them by scheduling appearances on Ready Steady Go! and on Top Of The Pops where, rather than performing live, they were expected to mime and lip sync. Morrison said of this appearance, [...] "It was ridiculous. We were totally anti <b>that</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing...</b> and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that...".

5000|$|An unnamed young man, {{living alone}} and {{working as a}} postman, is given a {{terminal}} diagnosis of brain cancer. As he despairs and wonders who will miss him when he dies, he returns home to find a doppelganger of himself, who {{claims to be the}} devil. The [...] "devil" [...] tells the man that if he agrees <b>that</b> one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> chosen by the devil, will be removed from the world (as if it had never been), then the man can have another day of life instead of dying the next day. The items are removed {{at the end of that}} day, giving the man one last day ostensibly to enjoy them before they disappear from the world. The story proceeds through successive days with new things being removed each day: after phones, then movies, clocks, and finally cats. The story focuses on the way in which the world is different for the man and his backstory without the removed items. Each of these is somehow crucial to his relationships with his few friends and family: an ex-girlfriend, a best friend who only knows how to interact with others through sharing movies, an acquaintance met in Buenos Aires, and most importantly, the man's late mother, whose cat he inherited. The story is told both in real time and in a series of flashbacks, and the viewer comes to have a better understanding of the young man's relationships with family and friends, and the pain and beauty of mortality.|$|R

You don’t hear him speak about much other than his music. So even if there was a girl who inspired this album, {{it would be difficult to}} know. There is a track on the album called “Annalee” about a mystery girl whose “eyes are bright as chandeliers” and “got them falling from the roof hypnotized and paralyzed” but there has been no answer as to who Annalee is.
