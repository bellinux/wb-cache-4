5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} the largest known of any modern or extinct animal, {{weighing}} on average about , {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's, and has a volume of about 8,000cm3. Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, {{it is not the only}} factor. Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans. The sperm whale has a lower encephalization quotient <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> whale and dolphin species, lower than that of non-human anthropoid apes, and much lower than humans'.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> shows.|$|E

5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
5|$|As of the {{election}} of Vincent Schoemehl as the city's youngest mayor ever in 1981, St. Louis's problems were more significant <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> rustbelt cities. Several major development projects incomplete and the city's economic base crumbling. However, Schoemehl developed two projects early in his three terms in office that assisted St. Louis: Operation Brightside provided city beautification through plantings and graffiti cleanup. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address crime, known as Operation SafeStreet, which blocked access to certain through streets and provided low-cost security measures to homeowners. Crime declined starting in 1984, and despite a small resurgence in 1989, continued to decline through the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E

2500|$|Gustave Caillebotte ( [...] ; 19 August 1848 – 21 February 1894) was a French painter, {{member and}} {{patron of the}} artists known as Impressionists, {{although}} he painted {{in a much more}} realistic manner <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> in the group. Caillebotte was noted for his early interest in photography as an art form.|$|R
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E
5|$|East Anglia {{was settled}} by the Anglo-Saxons {{as early as}} around 450, earlier <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> regions. It emerged from the {{settlement}} and political consolidation of Angles in the approximate area of the former territory of the Iceni and the Roman civitas with its centre at Venta Icenorum, close to Caistor St Edmund. According to Bede, the East Angles (as well as the Middle Angles, the Mercians and the Northumbrians) were descended from natives of Angeln (now in modern Germany). The first reference to the East Angles is from around 704–713, in the Whitby Life of St Gregory.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{ushered in}} a period of wide-ranging social and {{political}} changes, stemming largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois, supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city. In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> major Canadian cities.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} his {{numerous}} hits, Reed's personal problems prevented him from achieving {{the same level of}} fame as other popular blues artists of the time, though he had more hit songs <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> When Vee-Jay Records closed, his manager signed a contract with the fledgling ABC-Bluesway label, but Reed never produced another hit.|$|R
5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} {{was produced by}} the English printers Hazell, Watson and Viney. One of its owners, Walter Hazell, was a social reformer and supporter of women's suffrage. A successful firm, Hazell, Watson and Viney also produced the Woman's Signal and the Woman's Gazette, which featured female political and economic topics. The success of The Lady's Realm allowed it to remain published for eighteen years, from 1896 to 1915, much longer <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> contemporary women's periodicals. Thirty-six volumes were produced, from November 1896 to October 1914 (a final volume may have been released in 1915). It is not known why it ended, though Versteeg and her colleagues speculate that World War I {{may have been a}} cause, as was the case for other contemporary publications like Young Woman (1891–1914) and The Girl’s Realm (1892–1915).|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E
