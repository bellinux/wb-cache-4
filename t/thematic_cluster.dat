In order to find a solution for this issue, two hypotheses were formulated in this study to assess the effect of code-mixing, <b>thematic</b> <b>clustering,</b> and contextualization on L 2 vocabulary recognition and production. To this end, 120 EFL learners participated in this study. They were selected after the administration of a Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency. Then, they were divided into three groups of 40 participants. Each group was presented with just one method of the three mentioned methods. Every session 10 new words were presented to them. After the treatment, a recognition test and a production test were administered. The results of the data analysis revealed that, method of vocabulary presentation does not have a statistically significant effect on vocabulary recognition. But, there is a significant difference among the effects of code-mixing, <b>thematic</b> <b>clustering</b> and contextualization on L 2 vocabulary production. <b>Thematic</b> <b>clustering</b> was more conducive to vocabulary production...|$|R
40|$|Collections of Middle Dutch {{religious}} songs {{belonging to}} Devotio Moderna convents are {{strongly influenced by}} the medieval annual festive cycle. Contrary to most liturgical manuscripts, song collections are not only organised according to the liturgical calendar, they also recall the changing cosmic seasons and the cyclic rhythms that structured social life. Therefore, devout song collections offered their users songs suited for every season in the word’s broadest sense. In most manuscripts, songs with similar themes are grouped into seasonal thematic clusters. All collections contain a Christmas or wintertime cluster and most contain a Lent and Passiontide or spring cluster. Some collections also contain clusters about Mary or specific saints. Corresponding clusters in different collections show great similarities. The interpretation of this seasonal organisation is supported in two ways. First, the organisation patterns of each collection were studied by investigating headings and rubrics and by interpreting the song texts. Secondly, codicological research revealed the scribes’ tendency to copy every <b>thematic</b> <b>cluster</b> on a separate codicological unit. This coincidence of the clusters with the material structure of the manuscript enabled users to continue the oral gathering of new songs that could later {{be added to the}} every <b>thematic</b> <b>cluster</b> of the collection...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the immediate responses {{that emerged in}} American poetry {{after the terrorist attacks}} on 11 September, 2001. The aim of the paper is not to summarize the tragic events of 9 / 11, but to show how poets reacted to the terrorist attacks. In response to 9 / 11, a great deal of poetry emerged that expresses the poetic and completely personal, intimate side of the crisis, and many printed publications appeared in which poets addressed 9 / 11. Although one can find a range of features in American poetry after the attacks, there are notable similarities among the poetry being produced. The post- 9 / 11 poetry can be divided into thematic clusters. This paper is, however, limited to responses that deal only with feelings of disorientation, loss and despair after 9 / 11.

Forecast of the research progress is based on the analysis of the publications activity in the field of interest {{as well as on the}} dynamics of its change. Moreover, allocation of funds is hindered by exponential growth in the number of publications and patents. <b>Thematic</b> <b>clusters</b> become more and more difficult to identify, and their evolution hard to follow. The existing approaches of research field structuring and identification of its development are very limited. They do not identify the <b>thematic</b> <b>clusters</b> with adequate precision while the identified trends are often ambiguous. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop methods and tools, which are able to identify developing fields of research. The main objective of this Thesis is to develop tools and methods helping in the identification of the promising research topics in the field of separation processes. Two structuring methods as well as three approaches for identification of the development trends have been proposed. The proposed methods have been applied to the analysis of the research on distillation and filtration. The results show that the developed methods are universal and could be used to study of the various fields of research.

Subjects range from the presence and locations of CCTV and surveillance, the geological landscape underpinning but often hidden from city life, to sites of social and political unrest. Each map brings together three separate layers of information, normally disassociated, to mobilize their associative and contingent relations and offer up alternative re-presentations of the city. 'Bombed City, Construction sites, Quarries' as one example of the interplay between three such layers.

40|$|By way of {{introduction}} to the TELLUS <b>thematic</b> <b>cluster</b> on outcomes of the IMILAST project (Intercomparison of MId-LAtitude STorm diagnostics), this paper {{presents the results of}} new research that is fundamental for the correct interpretation of IMILAST results. Specifically we investigated the mesoscale structure of cyclonic windstorms, and the representation of those windstorms in re-analysis data. The paper concludes with an overview of the project itself. Twenty-nine historic windstorms are studied in detail, using wide-ranging observational data, and on this basis a conceptual model of the life cycle of a typical windstorm-generating cyclone is developed. The model delineates three wind phenomena, the warm jet, the sting jet and the cold jet, and maps out the typical damage footprint left by each. Focussing on the boundary layer, the physical processes at work in each jet zone are investigated. These include the impact of near-surface stability and exposure on gust strength. Based on numerous cases, a generic description of the sting jet is provided, with many new features highlighted. This phenomenon looks to be unique in that exceptional gusts can be realised well inland because destabilisation is activated from above. We next investigate how well the widely-referenced ERA-Interim re-analysis, that has been a primary data source for IMILAST, can represent windstorms. In many ways, performance is suboptimal. Compared to a benchmark manually-analysed dataset, windstorm-generating cyclones generally do not deepen rapidly enough. In part, this is a resolution limitation. For one medium-sized cyclone, it is shown, using other models, that horizontal resolution of order 20 km or better is required to capture the most damaging winds. In the context of IMILAST, which has used data at resolutions ≥ 80 km, this is a fundamental result. For this and other reasons, caution is clearly needed when inferring storm behaviour and severity from model-based metrics...|$|E

All VPT infants were healthy, without any neonatal or postnatal complications or injuries. METHODS: Computer-assisted content analysis was used to highlight <b>thematic</b> <b>clusters</b> from parents' narratives, which were labeled through qualitative interpretation. RESULTS: Two main dimensions (Adjustment Process to Preterm Birth and Parental Role Assumption) and three main <b>thematic</b> <b>clusters</b> (Facing the Unexpected, Learning to Parent, and Finally Back Home) described the parental experience. Mothers focused mostly on the Finally Back Home cluster, which was characterized by moderate levels of adjustment to preterm birth and by awareness of their own maternal roles.
